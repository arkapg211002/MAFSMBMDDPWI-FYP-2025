    \textbf{Component} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
    Dataset Acquisition & Reddit data was sourced using PRAW from relevant subreddits (Normal, Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar, PTSD). Extensive preprocessing ensured data integrity. \\ \hline
    Text Vectorization & TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words were used to convert text into numerical format via Scikit-learn, enabling efficient feature extraction and model training. Other vectorization techniques like Word2Vec, LIWC, and N-Grams were also explored. \\ \hline
    Machine Learning Models & Logistic Regression, SVM, Naïve Bayes, LSTM, Transformer, and XGBoost were implemented for multi-class classification of mental health conditions. \\ \hline
    Model Evaluation & Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess performance. Confusion matrices and ROC curves were generated for detailed model evaluation. \\ \hline
    Insights \& Recommendations & Findings inform mental health professionals and policymakers on probable issues and provide well-being insights. \\ \hline
    Documentation \& Reproducibility & Detailed documentation ensures usability, including methodology, code, and instructions for result reproduction. \\ \hline
