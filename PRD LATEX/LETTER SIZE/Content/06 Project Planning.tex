\section{Project Planning}

\begin{comment}
    State your project plan with up-to-date tasks, dependencies, timelines and milestones. You may paste your plan appropriately from MS Project etc.

    \hline
    \textbf{Phase} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
    Requirement Gathering and Analysis & This initial phase involved understanding the project's goals, objectives, and stakeholder expectations. \\ \hline
    Data Collection and Preparation & Utilizing the Reddit API, the data collection phase was executed. This included downloading the dataset, examining its structure, and performing data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure its suitability for analysis. \\ \hline
    Model Development & This phase included the creation of a Bag-of-Words model, splitting the dataset into training and test sets, and implementing various machine learning algorithms. \\ \hline
    Model Evaluation & Following model development, testing and validation of the models were performed to ensure they met the required accuracy benchmarks. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate model effectiveness. \\ \hline
    Final Deployment and Documentation & The last phase focused on deploying the best-performing model and creating comprehensive documentation. This included user manuals and technical documentation to facilitate future maintenance and enhancements. \\ \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsection{Dependencies, Milestones and Scheduling} 
\noindent
Key dependencies were identified for successful project progression. For instance, completion of the data preparation phase was critical before proceeding to model development. Milestones were established at the end of each phase to ensure accountability and track progress. The successful completion of the requirement gathering phase marked the first milestone, followed by the data preparation phase, and so on. Effective scheduling is vital for project success. A detailed timeline with tasks like requirement gathering, data preprocessing, model implementation, and testing was created, with flexibility for adjustments based on feedback. Key milestones, including data analysis, model validation, and user acceptance testing, ensure progress tracking. Using tools like Microsoft Project, we monitor tasks, manage resources, and maintain communication to deliver a high-quality solution on time.
