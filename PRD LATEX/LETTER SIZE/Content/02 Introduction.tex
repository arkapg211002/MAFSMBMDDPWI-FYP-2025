\subsection{Project Overview}
\noindent
Mental health disorders—including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and PTSD—affect millions worldwide and often go undetected until they manifest in crises. Meanwhile, people increasingly share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences on social media platforms (Reddit, Twitter etc) and in digital documents, leaving behind rich clues about their emotional state. In this work, we develop a multimodal AI framework that ingests text, images, video, and document feeds, uses OCR and deep-learning emotion analysis, and aligns user responses to established well-being scales. By fusing these signals through an ensemble of machine-learning and neural models, our system aims to flag early warning signs of distress and guide users toward timely, personalized support.

\subsection{Project Purpose}
\noindent
Early identification and intervention are critical for mitigating the severity of mental health crises, yet current screening methods often rely on self-report or occasional clinical encounters. This project aims to fill that gap by delivering a continuously learning, data-driven monitoring tool that passively and proactively analyzes digital footprints—from social posts to uploaded documents and survey responses—to surface warning signs long before a crisis point. By putting actionable insights directly into the hands of individuals, caregivers, and healthcare providers, it seeks to enable truly preventative mental-health care at scale.
