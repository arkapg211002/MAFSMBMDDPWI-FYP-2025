This project employs artificial intelligence to detect early signs of mental health issues by analyzing text, images, videos shared on platforms like Reddit and Twitter. It also allows to detect mental issues from PDFs and responses a user makes when a questionnaire is presented to him/her on the basis of an image shown. It integrates techniques such as emotion detection, image captioning, multilingual support, and psychological assessments inspired from Rorschach Inkblot Test and Ryff's Wellbeing Scale. Using an ensemble of models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, LSTM, XGboost, Transformer), the system achieves 98.03\% accuracy, with a hierarchical model reaching 96.25\% on larger datasets. The web application supports model retraining, updating knowledge base, wellbeing surveys and providing actionable insights using Gemini and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), incorporating visualizations and mapping mental health concerns to wellbeing parameters for timely interventions.
