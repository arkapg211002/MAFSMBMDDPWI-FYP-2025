\noindent
This project aims to analyze social media posts for early detection of mental health disorders. Specifically, it focuses on using machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify social media text data based on potential mental health issues. The problem lies in efficiently detecting patterns that indicate mental health conditions within large, unstructured datasets. Using methods like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, XGboost, LSTM, Transformer the project seeks to enhance the accuracy of detecting mental health concern with a specific probability. Expected results include a robust classifier capable of distinguishing between different mental health concerns with high accuracy. This project could provide a valuable tool for mental health monitoring on social platforms.
