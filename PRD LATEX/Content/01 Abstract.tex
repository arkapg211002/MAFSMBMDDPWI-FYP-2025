This project employs artificial intelligence to detect early signs of mental health issues by analyzing text, images, videos, audio, and PDFs shared on platforms like Reddit and Twitter. It integrates techniques such as emotion detection, image captioning, multilingual support, and psychological assessments inspired from Rorschach Inkblot Test and Ryff's Wellbeing Scale. Using an ensemble of models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, LSTM, XGboost, Transformer), the system achieves 98.03\% accuracy, with a hierarchical model reaching 96.25\% on larger datasets. The web application supports real-time analysis, model retraining, and wellbeing surveys, providing actionable insights using Gemini and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) through visualizations and mapping mental health concerns to wellbeing parameters for timely interventions.
