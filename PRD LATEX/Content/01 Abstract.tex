This project employs AI to detect early signs of mental health issues by analyzing text, images, videos, audio, and PDFs shared on platforms like social media. It integrates advanced techniques such as facial expression recognition, image captioning, multilingual support, and psychological assessments like the Rorschach Inkblot Test and Ryff's Wellbeing Scale. Using an ensemble of models (Logistic Regression, SVM, LSTM, etc.), the system achieves 98.03\% accuracy, with a hierarchical model reaching 96.25\% on larger datasets. The web application supports real-time analysis, model retraining, and wellbeing surveys, providing actionable insights through visualizations and mapping mental health concerns to wellbeing parameters for timely interventions.
