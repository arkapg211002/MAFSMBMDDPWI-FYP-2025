\subsection{Requirement Elaboration}
% Create separate sections for separate areas of requirement as in Requirement Matrix. 
% \vspace{.1in}

% \noindent
% For \textbf{Requirement Elaboration}, titles of s6.2.1, 6.2.2 etc. should be with the name of respective requirement areas. Your focus should be on: “What is needed in the system?” Requirement IDs should match with the ID column under Requirement Matrix.
