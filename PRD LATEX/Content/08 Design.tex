\noindent
The image captioning process using Python’s Transformers module and the ViT-GPT2 model involves several key steps. The user uploads an image, which is preprocessed by resizing to \(224 \times 224\) pixels, normalizing pixel values, and converting it into a tensor format. The Vision Transformer (ViT) divides the image into \(16 \times 16\) patches, embeds them, and processes them through transformer layers to extract visual features. The resulting embedding is passed to GPT-2, which generates a sequence of text tokens iteratively using its language model. Tokens are decoded back into human-readable text using the GPT-2 tokenizer, cleaned for readability, and output as a concise description. This pipeline leverages ViT for feature extraction and GPT-2 for language generation, enabling efficient and almost accurate image captioning.

\subsection{Emotion Detection Functionality}

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \label{dfdl14456}  % Label for referencing the figure
\end{figure}

\noindent
DeepFace analysis processes facial features from uploaded images or video frames through a structured pipeline. It starts with face detection using models like MTCNN, Dlib, or OpenCV to locate and align faces. The detected faces are cropped and passed to feature extraction, where pre-trained models like VGG-Face or Facenet generate numerical embeddings. These embeddings are compared using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance for tasks like emotion detection (e.g., happiness, sadness), demographic analysis (e.g., age, gender), or face verification. The results, such as detected emotions or attributes, are then displayed to the user. This process enables real-time analysis of facial expressions and emotions, providing valuable insights for mental health monitoring and wellbeing assessment.

\subsection{Extract Text From Image}

\begin{figure}[h!]  
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Images/DFD L2 TEXT EXTRACT.png}  
    \caption{DFD Level 2 of Text Extraction from Image}
    \label{dfdl13456}  % Label for referencing the figure
\end{figure}

\noindent
The process of extracting text from an image using Tesseract-OCR begins with preprocessing the uploaded image. The image is converted to grayscale, noise is reduced using Gaussian or Median Blur, and binarization (e.g., Otsu’s thresholding) isolates text from the background. Text regions are detected using contour analysis or connected components. The processed image is then passed to Tesseract, which uses an LSTM-based neural network to recognize characters and generate machine-readable text, enhanced by language models for accuracy. Postprocessing corrects errors via spell-checking and rule-based replacements (e.g., \texttt{0} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{O}), and formats the text into paragraphs or lines. The final output, displayed or saved as \texttt{.txt} or \texttt{.docx}, is ready for applications like document analysis. This pipeline combines image enhancement, deep learning, and text correction for high-quality results.

\subsection{Translation to English}

\begin{figure}[h!]  
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Images/DFD L2 TE.png}  
    \caption{DFD Level 2 of Translation to English}
    \label{dfdl111}  % Label for referencing the figure
\end{figure}

\noindent
The process of translating text to English using DeepTranslator begins with preprocessing the input to clean unwanted characters and detect the source language using machine learning models like Google’s Compact Language Detector. The prepared text is passed to DeepTranslator, which interfaces with APIs like Google Translate or Microsoft Translator. These APIs use neural machine translation (NMT) with encoder-decoder architectures and attention mechanisms to translate the text into English. Transformer-based models enhance accuracy by capturing context and long-range dependencies. Postprocessing ensures quality by validating completeness, correcting errors, and preserving formatting. The final translated text is displayed or saved, ensuring accuracy and readability. This pipeline integrates NLP, deep learning, and error handling for reliable translations.

\subsection{Audio Mood Analysis}

\begin{figure}[h!]  
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Images/DFD L2 AM.png}  
    \caption{DFD Level 2 of Audio Mood Analysis}
    \label{dfdl671}  % Label for referencing the figure
\end{figure}

\noindent
The \texttt{analyze\_audio\_mood} function begins with the user providing a video file path. The audio is extracted using the \texttt{extract\_audio\_from\_video} function and loaded into memory with the Librosa library. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are computed using \texttt{librosa.feature.mfcc} to capture frequency patterns for mood analysis. The MFCC array is segmented into four frequency bands—low, mid-low, mid-high, and high—and the scalar mean of each band is calculated to simplify data for classification. The mood is classified (e.g., normal, calm, anxious) based on the dominant frequency characteristics. Results can be further enhanced using the Gemini API to provide tone, mood, and summary details for the audio. This process combines audio feature extraction and classification for comprehensive mood analysis.

\subsection{Prediction to Wellbeing Mapping}

\begin{figure}[h!]  
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Images/DFD L2 MW.png}  
    \caption{DFD Level 2 of Prediction to Wellbeing Mapping}
    \label{dfdl166}  % Label for referencing the figure
\end{figure}

\noindent
The system first processes user input (text, behavioral data, or health metrics) through preprocessing and feature extraction. Machine learning models then predict the most likely mental health condition along with associated probabilities. The top predicted issue and its probability are then fed into GEMINI 1.5 FLASH with a structured prompt to generate wellbeing insights based on Ryff’s six parameters. To refine these insights, an association matrix maps the probabilities of all predicted issues to specific wellbeing parameters, selecting 1 to 3 key dimensions (e.g., autonomy, personal growth, or self-acceptance). This ensures that the user receives targeted recommendations for improving their psychological wellbeing.

\vspace{1em}

\noindent
The system enhances mental health classification using ML and DL models, analyzing text, behavioral data, and multimedia inputs. DeepFace aids facial emotion recognition, while text classifiers (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Transformer, XGBoost, LSTM) process written data. Audio mood analysis (MFCC) and facial expression detection refine emotional assessment. Additionally, real-time social media monitoring provides deeper insights into a user’s mental state.
