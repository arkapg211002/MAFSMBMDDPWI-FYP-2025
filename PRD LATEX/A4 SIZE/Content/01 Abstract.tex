\noindent
This project presents a scalable, multimodal AI framework for the early detection of mental health issues that combines an ensemble of diverse classifiers with a hierarchical model to achieve up to 98.03\% accuracy on standard benchmarks and 96.25\% on larger datasets. Packaged as a web application, the system offers continuous model retraining and dynamic knowledge-base updates, interactive well-being assessments, and retrieval-augmented generation to deliver personalized, evidence-based insights, complemented by rich visual analytics and actionable recommendations to enable timely interventions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the platform’s effectiveness and extensibility for proactive mental health monitoring.
