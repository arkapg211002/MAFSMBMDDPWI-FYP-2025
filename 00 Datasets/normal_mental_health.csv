"I was in a car accident Part 1 This is a 100% true story that happened to me. I‚Äôll be altering the names and location for privacy purposes On Sunday September 9th, 2018 my life changed. I‚Äôll start off with, I was spending Friday-Sunday with my cousin down at her house. Friday and Saturday were great, and nothing crazy happened. 

But Sunday is when things took a turn for the worst. We went to my uncles (her dads) house to watch the Browns VS Steelers football game, now not only did we tie, I was the only Steelers fan in the house, everyone else was a browns fan. 

We stayed later than we anticipated because we were just spending time with family, I was playing and goofing around with my cousins boyfriends son and then my cousins nephew, just playing with swords and all his other toys. We finally get her nephew to fall asleep, and that was our queue to leave before he woke up. 

The day had been gloomy and rainy, but my cousins boyfriend needed to stop at a redbox to drop off some movies that he rented for some of his clients ( he‚Äôs a Corrections officer at a rehab facility), so we drop them off, and as we pull out we obviously check both ways and not a single car is coming. 

We pull up to the red light, and while we are waiting for it to change we‚Äôre just messing around with Jake ( who is the son to my cousins boyfriend) about how he‚Äôs farting and it‚Äôs gross, when all of a sudden we get rear ended. 

My four month old cousin cries instantly, my cousin jumps out of the car and confronts the person, Brian ( cousins boyfriend) is trying to calm down the baby, meanwhile I jump out and my cousin says to call the cops. I jump into the car and grab my phone, and I dial 911 but it‚Äôs not going through, I‚Äôve had so many nightmares where that happens, so I burst into tears because it wouldn‚Äôt connect. 

Finally it connects to the operator and here‚Äôs how the conversation goes: 
911 operator: 911 what‚Äôs your emergency?
Me: hi my family and I were just rear ended at a red light 
Operator: okay m‚Äôam where is your location? 
Me: -Blank, Ohio 
Operator: okay what road are you on? 
Me: I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôm not from around this area but we have a Walgreens to the left of us and a mr hero and a Georgios to the right and a sign for highway (blank) across the street. 
Operator: so your at blank road?
Me: I guess? I‚Äôm not from around here so I don‚Äôt know the name of it? 
Operator: do you need an ambulance?
Me: yes I‚Äôd say we do because there‚Äôs a 4 month old in the car 
Operator: okay they are on their way, bye 

So the operator hangs up the phone, and I hear sirens from behind us. A cop shows up, immediately after a fire truck pulls up onto the sidewalk next to us, and another cup comes from another direction and then pulls up in front of us. At this point I‚Äôm hyperventilating because I‚Äôve never been in a car accident before and was totally freaked out.

The cop asks me if I‚Äôm okay, and I immediately respond with: I have anxiety! And he goes okay, well you‚Äôre hyperventilating, which is only going to make this worse, take some deep breathes for me okay? So I start taking breaths and he asks for my ID, and I say I have temps but they are expired, and says that it‚Äôs okay, so I hand it to him and he says you live at 12345 road? I reply with yes, he asks for my name and phone number.

I accidentally give him my mom‚Äôs number instead of my own, because I was really worked up. At this point it‚Äôs really starting to rain, and I‚Äôm feeling very light headed so I sit in the car, and suddenly I feel like I‚Äôm gonna get sick, but I look up and a cop is walking towards me as I open the door and start to get sick. This happens a few times, and I feel awful about it because it happened anytime a cop came near me. 

I eventually calm down enough to write a police statement, and a release form for the paramedics saying I wasn‚Äôt going to the hospital via an ambulance. It‚Äôs at this point I‚Äôm starting to feel a lot of pain in my back and my neck, I should mention I‚Äôm already in physical therapy for chronic migraines and back pain, and I immediately knew that this wasn‚Äôt good




Once we get that settled, we drive to this off-standing emergency room down the road from the accident and close to my uncles house ",normal

"I was in a car accident Part 1 This is a 100% true story that happened to me. I‚Äôll be altering the names and location for privacy purposes On Sunday September 9th, 2018 my life changed. I‚Äôll start off with, I was spending Friday-Sunday with my cousin down at her house. Friday and Saturday were great, and nothing crazy happened. 

But Sunday is when things took a turn for the worst. We went to my uncles (her dads) house to watch the Browns VS Steelers football game, now not only did we tie, I was the only Steelers fan in the house, everyone else was a browns fan. 

We stayed later than we anticipated because we were just spending time with family, I was playing and goofing around with my cousins boyfriends son and then my cousins nephew, just playing with swords and all his other toys. We finally get her nephew to fall asleep, and that was our queue to leave before he woke up. 

The day had been gloomy and rainy, but my cousins boyfriend needed to stop at a redbox to drop off some movies that he rented for some of his clients ( he‚Äôs a Corrections officer at a rehab facility), so we drop them off, and as we pull out we obviously check both ways and not a single car is coming. 

We pull up to the red light, and while we are waiting for it to change we‚Äôre just messing around with Jake ( who is the son to my cousins boyfriend) about how he‚Äôs farting and it‚Äôs gross, when all of a sudden we get rear ended. 

My four month old cousin cries instantly, my cousin jumps out of the car and confronts the person, Brian ( cousins boyfriend) is trying to calm down the baby, meanwhile I jump out and my cousin says to call the cops. I jump into the car and grab my phone, and I dial 911 but it‚Äôs not going through, I‚Äôve had so many nightmares where that happens, so I burst into tears because it wouldn‚Äôt connect. 

Finally it connects to the operator and here‚Äôs how the conversation goes: 
911 operator: 911 what‚Äôs your emergency?
Me: hi my family and I were just rear ended at a red light 
Operator: okay m‚Äôam where is your location? 
Me: -Blank, Ohio 
Operator: okay what road are you on? 
Me: I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôm not from around this area but we have a Walgreens to the left of us and a mr hero and a Georgios to the right and a sign for highway (blank) across the street. 
Operator: so your at blank road?
Me: I guess? I‚Äôm not from around here so I don‚Äôt know the name of it? 
Operator: do you need an ambulance?
Me: yes I‚Äôd say we do because there‚Äôs a 4 month old in the car 
Operator: okay they are on their way, bye 

So the operator hangs up the phone, and I hear sirens from behind us. A cop shows up, immediately after a fire truck pulls up onto the sidewalk next to us, and another cup comes from another direction and then pulls up in front of us. At this point I‚Äôm hyperventilating because I‚Äôve never been in a car accident before and was totally freaked out.

The cop asks me if I‚Äôm okay, and I immediately respond with: I have anxiety! And he goes okay, well you‚Äôre hyperventilating, which is only going to make this worse, take some deep breathes for me okay? So I start taking breaths and he asks for my ID, and I say I have temps but they are expired, and says that it‚Äôs okay, so I hand it to him and he says you live at 12345 road? I reply with yes, he asks for my name and phone number.

I accidentally give him my mom‚Äôs number instead of my own, because I was really worked up. At this point it‚Äôs really starting to rain, and I‚Äôm feeling very light headed so I sit in the car, and suddenly I feel like I‚Äôm gonna get sick, but I look up and a cop is walking towards me as I open the door and start to get sick. This happens a few times, and I feel awful about it because it happened anytime a cop came near me. 

I eventually calm down enough to write a police statement, and a release form for the paramedics saying I wasn‚Äôt going to the hospital via an ambulance. It‚Äôs at this point I‚Äôm starting to feel a lot of pain in my back and my neck, I should mention I‚Äôm already in physical therapy for chronic migraines and back pain, and I immediately knew that this wasn‚Äôt good




Once we get that settled, we drive to this off-standing emergency room down the road from the accident and close to my uncles house ",normal

"I was in a car accident Part 1 This is a 100% true story that happened to me. I‚Äôll be altering the names and location for privacy purposes On Sunday September 9th, 2018 my life changed. I‚Äôll start off with, I was spending Friday-Sunday with my cousin down at her house. Friday and Saturday were great, and nothing crazy happened. 

But Sunday is when things took a turn for the worst. We went to my uncles (her dads) house to watch the Browns VS Steelers football game, now not only did we tie, I was the only Steelers fan in the house, everyone else was a browns fan. 

We stayed later than we anticipated because we were just spending time with family, I was playing and goofing around with my cousins boyfriends son and then my cousins nephew, just playing with swords and all his other toys. We finally get her nephew to fall asleep, and that was our queue to leave before he woke up. 

The day had been gloomy and rainy, but my cousins boyfriend needed to stop at a redbox to drop off some movies that he rented for some of his clients ( he‚Äôs a Corrections officer at a rehab facility), so we drop them off, and as we pull out we obviously check both ways and not a single car is coming. 

We pull up to the red light, and while we are waiting for it to change we‚Äôre just messing around with Jake ( who is the son to my cousins boyfriend) about how he‚Äôs farting and it‚Äôs gross, when all of a sudden we get rear ended. 

My four month old cousin cries instantly, my cousin jumps out of the car and confronts the person, Brian ( cousins boyfriend) is trying to calm down the baby, meanwhile I jump out and my cousin says to call the cops. I jump into the car and grab my phone, and I dial 911 but it‚Äôs not going through, I‚Äôve had so many nightmares where that happens, so I burst into tears because it wouldn‚Äôt connect. 

Finally it connects to the operator and here‚Äôs how the conversation goes: 
911 operator: 911 what‚Äôs your emergency?
Me: hi my family and I were just rear ended at a red light 
Operator: okay m‚Äôam where is your location? 
Me: -Blank, Ohio 
Operator: okay what road are you on? 
Me: I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôm not from around this area but we have a Walgreens to the left of us and a mr hero and a Georgios to the right and a sign for highway (blank) across the street. 
Operator: so your at blank road?
Me: I guess? I‚Äôm not from around here so I don‚Äôt know the name of it? 
Operator: do you need an ambulance?
Me: yes I‚Äôd say we do because there‚Äôs a 4 month old in the car 
Operator: okay they are on their way, bye 

So the operator hangs up the phone, and I hear sirens from behind us. A cop shows up, immediately after a fire truck pulls up onto the sidewalk next to us, and another cup comes from another direction and then pulls up in front of us. At this point I‚Äôm hyperventilating because I‚Äôve never been in a car accident before and was totally freaked out.

The cop asks me if I‚Äôm okay, and I immediately respond with: I have anxiety! And he goes okay, well you‚Äôre hyperventilating, which is only going to make this worse, take some deep breathes for me okay? So I start taking breaths and he asks for my ID, and I say I have temps but they are expired, and says that it‚Äôs okay, so I hand it to him and he says you live at 12345 road? I reply with yes, he asks for my name and phone number.

I accidentally give him my mom‚Äôs number instead of my own, because I was really worked up. At this point it‚Äôs really starting to rain, and I‚Äôm feeling very light headed so I sit in the car, and suddenly I feel like I‚Äôm gonna get sick, but I look up and a cop is walking towards me as I open the door and start to get sick. This happens a few times, and I feel awful about it because it happened anytime a cop came near me. 

I eventually calm down enough to write a police statement, and a release form for the paramedics saying I wasn‚Äôt going to the hospital via an ambulance. It‚Äôs at this point I‚Äôm starting to feel a lot of pain in my back and my neck, I should mention I‚Äôm already in physical therapy for chronic migraines and back pain, and I immediately knew that this wasn‚Äôt good




Once we get that settled, we drive to this off-standing emergency room down the road from the accident and close to my uncles house ",normal

"AI Revolution at a Crossroads: Biden Declares AI America's 'Most Urgent Focus' - How Will the 2024 Election Shape Our Technological Future? Last week, President Biden released a¬†[memorandum¬†](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-outlines-coordinated-approach-to-harness-power-of-ai-for-u-s-national-security/)declaring AI as America's ""most urgent focus,"" warning it could ""threaten United States national security, bolster authoritarianism worldwide, undermine democratic institutions and processes, facilitate human rights abuses, and weaken the rules-based international order."" They stated that this is now our priority as a nation, akin to another ""[Sputnik Moment](https://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/sputnik+moment.html)"", this time from the Public Sector. This isn't coming from Silicon Valley - it's our government acknowledging the transformation ahead. Yet, this future monumental shift was never talked about in the debates, leaving voters uninformed of its impact.

So, what better place to initiate a dialogue on the impacts of each candidate on the future of Technology and AI, than in r/Technology?

The timing is crucial: we're about to elect the president who will shape how this technology transforms our society. To understand what's at stake, we can look at how different leadership approaches handle major societal disruptions.

# The Context

During COVID - our last major global disruption - we saw a focus on corporate stability, resulting in billionaires increasing wealth by¬†[2,100 billion dollars](https://inequality.org/great-divide/billionaires-2-trillion-richer-than-before-pandemic/)¬†while Americans waited for¬†[$1,200](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/live-blog-posts/how-irs-panicked-trump-stimulus-check-signature-gambit/)¬†checks. Elon Musk, who Trump aims to appoint as his ""[Secretary of Cost Cutting](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-elon-musk-government-job-cost-cutting-1968474)"" in particular saw a¬†[$184,000,000,000](https://inequality.org/great-divide/billionaires-2-trillion-richer-than-before-pandemic/), or 750% growth, in his net worth during this time.

The AI revolution presents similar choices.¬†[McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#introduction)¬†projects AI could replace up to 40% of current working hours by 2030.¬†[The World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2023/)¬†estimates 85 million jobs may be displaced by 2025. Meanwhile, AI is expected to create¬†[$19.9 trillion](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52600524)¬†in global economic value by 2030.

**The key question is:**¬†How will this wealth be distributed, and will Americans be protected?

**Looking at track records:**

* **Harris**: Supported¬†[AI regulation legislation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-outlines-coordinated-approach-to-harness-power-of-ai-for-u-s-national-security/)¬†and worker protection programs¬†[\[1\]](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/16/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-historic-step-to-advance-worker-empowerment-rights-and-high-labor-standards-globally/)¬†[\[2\]](https://www.dol.gov/general/labortaskforce)¬†[\[3\]](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/fact-sheet-ahead-labor-day-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-empower). She also plans to provide a¬†[$6,000](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/kamala-harriss-tax-plans-2024)¬†credit for your first-born child, on top of a¬†[$10,000](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/kamala-harriss-tax-plans-2024)¬†tax credit for first-time homebuyers. She¬†[plans to fund this](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/kamala-harriss-tax-plans-2024)¬†by raising taxes on families earning over $400,000/year and increasing capital gains taxes on millionaires.
* **Trump**: Reduced technology oversight regulations and prioritized business interests¬†[\[4\]](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/examining-some-of-trumps-deregulation-efforts-lessons-from-the-brookings-regulatory-tracker/). In fact, he had an executive order that required¬†[agencies to eliminate two rules for every new rule](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-has-trumps-deregulatory-order-worked-in-practice/). Trump aims to deepen the tax cuts he gave to corporations to only 15%, implement a 10% tariff to be paid by Americans on foreign tech and goods, and¬†**reduce environmental restrictions**¬†[\[5\]](https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans). Experts say that Trump's plans will cost the US as much as $15.55 trillion dollars through 2035, or double what Harris' plan will cost.¬†[\[6\]](https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans)

# What does this mean for¬†r/Technology? That's what this post is about!

# Questions:

1. How might each candidate approach the need for education on how to use AI for their citizens?
2. What specific qualifications should we look for in leadership when it comes to managing technological transformation?
3. How might Harris and Trump's response differ in acting upon the coming changes that AI brings?
4. What role should government play in ensuring AI benefits are distributed fairly? Or should market forces determine the outcome?
5. How can we prevent AI from exacerbating existing economic inequalities while maintaining American competitiveness?
6. How should we balance innovation with worker protection? What specific policies would help?

In closing: These aren't abstract concerns - they're immediate challenges that will affect you. As the federal memo makes clear, we're facing a technological revolution that will reshape our society. The choices made in the next four years will determine whether that revolution benefits all Americans or just a select few. I hope you'll consider this when placing your votes (if you're a citizen).

It's my personal opinion that we sit at a fork in the road; one path leads to a certain dystopian future, and the other leads to one where we might all see the benefit and wonder that this technology may bring. Harris listens to the experts. Trump¬†*never*¬†has.",normal

"AI Revolution at a Crossroads: Biden Declares AI America's 'Most Urgent Focus' - How Will the 2024 Election Shape Our Technological Future? Last week, President Biden released a¬†[memorandum¬†](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-outlines-coordinated-approach-to-harness-power-of-ai-for-u-s-national-security/)declaring AI as America's ""most urgent focus,"" warning it could ""threaten United States national security, bolster authoritarianism worldwide, undermine democratic institutions and processes, facilitate human rights abuses, and weaken the rules-based international order."" They stated that this is now our priority as a nation, akin to another ""[Sputnik Moment](https://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/sputnik+moment.html)"", this time from the Public Sector. This isn't coming from Silicon Valley - it's our government acknowledging the transformation ahead. Yet, this future monumental shift was never talked about in the debates, leaving voters uninformed of its impact.

So, what better place to initiate a dialogue on the impacts of each candidate on the future of Technology and AI, than in r/Technology?

The timing is crucial: we're about to elect the president who will shape how this technology transforms our society. To understand what's at stake, we can look at how different leadership approaches handle major societal disruptions.

# The Context

During COVID - our last major global disruption - we saw a focus on corporate stability, resulting in billionaires increasing wealth by¬†[2,100 billion dollars](https://inequality.org/great-divide/billionaires-2-trillion-richer-than-before-pandemic/)¬†while Americans waited for¬†[$1,200](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/live-blog-posts/how-irs-panicked-trump-stimulus-check-signature-gambit/)¬†checks. Elon Musk, who Trump aims to appoint as his ""[Secretary of Cost Cutting](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-elon-musk-government-job-cost-cutting-1968474)"" in particular saw a¬†[$184,000,000,000](https://inequality.org/great-divide/billionaires-2-trillion-richer-than-before-pandemic/), or 750% growth, in his net worth during this time.

The AI revolution presents similar choices.¬†[McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#introduction)¬†projects AI could replace up to 40% of current working hours by 2030.¬†[The World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2023/)¬†estimates 85 million jobs may be displaced by 2025. Meanwhile, AI is expected to create¬†[$19.9 trillion](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52600524)¬†in global economic value by 2030.

**The key question is:**¬†How will this wealth be distributed, and will Americans be protected?

**Looking at track records:**

* **Harris**: Supported¬†[AI regulation legislation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/24/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-outlines-coordinated-approach-to-harness-power-of-ai-for-u-s-national-security/)¬†and worker protection programs¬†[\[1\]](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/11/16/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-historic-step-to-advance-worker-empowerment-rights-and-high-labor-standards-globally/)¬†[\[2\]](https://www.dol.gov/general/labortaskforce)¬†[\[3\]](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/fact-sheet-ahead-labor-day-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-empower). She also plans to provide a¬†[$6,000](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/kamala-harriss-tax-plans-2024)¬†credit for your first-born child, on top of a¬†[$10,000](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/kamala-harriss-tax-plans-2024)¬†tax credit for first-time homebuyers. She¬†[plans to fund this](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/kamala-harriss-tax-plans-2024)¬†by raising taxes on families earning over $400,000/year and increasing capital gains taxes on millionaires.
* **Trump**: Reduced technology oversight regulations and prioritized business interests¬†[\[4\]](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/examining-some-of-trumps-deregulation-efforts-lessons-from-the-brookings-regulatory-tracker/). In fact, he had an executive order that required¬†[agencies to eliminate two rules for every new rule](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-has-trumps-deregulatory-order-worked-in-practice/). Trump aims to deepen the tax cuts he gave to corporations to only 15%, implement a 10% tariff to be paid by Americans on foreign tech and goods, and¬†**reduce environmental restrictions**¬†[\[5\]](https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans). Experts say that Trump's plans will cost the US as much as $15.55 trillion dollars through 2035, or double what Harris' plan will cost.¬†[\[6\]](https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans)

# What does this mean for¬†r/Technology? That's what this post is about!

# Questions:

1. How might each candidate approach the need for education on how to use AI for their citizens?
2. What specific qualifications should we look for in leadership when it comes to managing technological transformation?
3. How might Harris and Trump's response differ in acting upon the coming changes that AI brings?
4. What role should government play in ensuring AI benefits are distributed fairly? Or should market forces determine the outcome?
5. How can we prevent AI from exacerbating existing economic inequalities while maintaining American competitiveness?
6. How should we balance innovation with worker protection? What specific policies would help?

In closing: These aren't abstract concerns - they're immediate challenges that will affect you. As the federal memo makes clear, we're facing a technological revolution that will reshape our society. The choices made in the next four years will determine whether that revolution benefits all Americans or just a select few. I hope you'll consider this when placing your votes (if you're a citizen).

It's my personal opinion that we sit at a fork in the road; one path leads to a certain dystopian future, and the other leads to one where we might all see the benefit and wonder that this technology may bring. Harris listens to the experts. Trump¬†*never*¬†has.",normal

"Are traditional secretaries under threat from automation? I've noticed a spate of companies and websites offering automated secretaries for phone call handling/etc.

Like [https://smart-pa.com/uk/secretarial-services](https://smart-pa.com/uk/secretarial-services) and [https://ai-receptionist.ie/](https://ai-receptionist.ie/)

Chat bots have been around for a while, but is the voice handling of recent models likely to significantly disrupt this industry?

Articles around the potential impact tend to keep their powder dry - detailing the fairly obvious pros and cons of human vs AI secretaries; namely that a secretary isn't just a data management person, [but fills a more general role of office support](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/secretary-jobs-in-the-age-of-ai) and provides a human touch [that is difficult to replicate](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240109-the-human-touch-ai-virtual-assistants-cant-replace). 

However it is inescapable that SMEs can be cash strapped and personnel is one of the heaviest expenses.

"Hi everyone! We‚Äôre Vickie Robinson, General Manager and Ryan Palmer Director of Microsoft‚Äôs Airband Initiative, working to bring internet access to 250 million people globally by 2025. Ask us anything about how we‚Äôre working with governments, nonprofits and internet providers to make this happen. The Internet is a critical part of our daily lives, almost taken for granted thanks to its wide availability. But there are 2.6 BILLION people in the world who remain offline today. Without internet access, we see exacerbated economic inequalities and inhibited access to social services, civic activities, and online learning resources.

Internet access isn‚Äôt a luxury, it‚Äôs a fundamental right. We lead the work behind Microsoft‚Äôs[ Airband Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/airband-initiative?msockid=31d122b3ddc26cf134ae336cdc246dde) to bring together a global network of internet and energy providers, government agencies, nonprofits, and private sector companies to close the digital divide.

We‚Äôre aiming to connect 250 million people globally by 2025, focusing particularly on rural areas where internet access is limited -- and that requires big investments in infrastructure. In the United States, for example, our internet service provider partners have received more than $725 million in government infrastructure funding awards to expand networks and drive broadband adoption, with approximately 80% going to rural communities.

We also recently refreshed our [Digital Equity Dashboard](https://msit.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMmUyMzY2YjUtNDdmMS00ZTYyLThhMDAtMTUxMmZmNTcxMGE0IiwidCI6IjcyZjk4OGJmLTg2ZjEtNDFhZi05MWFiLTJkN2NkMDExZGI0NyIsImMiOjV9), which combines government and private sector data to help understand where there are broadband gaps in the United States ‚Äì right down to the census block level. We want to provide transparent data to everyone and help policymakers make & maximize investments in areas of highest need. If you‚Äôre curious about how your town compares to your neighbor‚Äôs, take a look! ¬†

A little bit about us! Before I (Vickie) began working at Microsoft, I spent nearly 20 years at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). I was most recently the acting CEO of the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), the organization designated by the FCC to administer the Universal Service Fund (USF), which subsidizes broadband network expansions and provides discounts to low-income consumers. ¬†

I (Ryan) also came from the FCC where I led the Telecommunications Access Policy Division, the division at the FCC responsible for developing policies for administration and oversight of the Universal Service Fund programs. ¬†

Ask us anything about our work!

We created this to help federal, state, and local policymakers gain a better understanding of the factors contributing to the digital divide. We‚Äôve long held the belief in the value of data, and this dashboard refresh is the latest step in our ongoing journey to help close the digital divide around the world.

"Comcast is trying to censor our pro-net neutrality website that calls for an investigation into fake FCC comments potentially funded by the cable lobby Fight for the Future has received [a cease and desist order](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ) from Comcast‚Äôs lawyers, claiming that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) - a pro-net neutrality site encouraging Internet users to investigate an astroturfing campaign possibly funded by the cable lobby - violates Comcast‚Äôs ""valuable intellectual property."" The letter threatens legal action if the domain is not transferred to Comcast‚Äôs control.

The notice is ironic, in that it‚Äôs a perfect example of why we need Title II based net neutrality protections that ban ISPs from blocking or throttling content. 

**If the FCC‚Äôs current proposal is enacted, there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply censoring this site -- or other sites critical of their corporate policies -- without even bothering with lawyers.**

The legal notice can be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ). It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast‚Äôs trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case ""[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)"" which held that a site critical of a company‚Äôs practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names‚Äîin this case taubmansucks.com‚Äîwere free speech)

[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)‚Äôs docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.

Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can‚Äôt trust companies like Comcast to just ""behave"" when they have abused their power time and time again.

Fight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.

"PornHub, OK Cupid, Imgur, DuckDuckGo, Namecheap, Bittorrent, and a bunch of other big sites have joined the Internet-Wide Day of Action for Net Neutrality on July 12 (Amazon, Kickstarter, Etsy, Mozilla, and Reddit were already on board.) Hey reddit, I wanted to give a quick update on the **[Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** that lots of us are planning for July 12th.

There's a huge amount of momentum. This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors) [announced](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters) that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits!

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this. ",normal

"The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving. This could be the last chance for Internet users to make their voices heard. Hey reddit, I wanted to give everyone a heads up that Ajit Pai, former Verizon lawyer and current chairman of the FCC, is expected to circulate the text of his rule and announce a vote to gut net neutrality protections on November 22, the day before Thanksgiving.

**[That means these next few weeks could be our last chance to speak out to defend net neutrality. You can use this tool to call your lawmakers.](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

Once the FCC announces a vote (which would likely be at its open meeting in December), it will become much, much harder to stop them from gutting the rules that prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T from charging us all extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling, blocking, and censoring websites, apps, games, and streaming services. 

The good news is that we are hearing from people who are meeting with Congress that there are key lawmakers who are sympathetic to the cause, and considering stepping in to slow down the FCC. **But they need to be getting a lot more phone calls from constituents in order to act.**

The groups behind the big Net Neutrality [day of action](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12) that happened back on July 12 are calling on all Internet users, websites, apps, subreddits, and online communities to do everything they can to drive as many phone calls to Congress as possible between now and November 22.

**We have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join**

"Eight members of Congress that voted to kill broadband privacy are now leading the charge to kill Net Neutrality as well FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai is advancing a plan to kill net neutrality and let ISPs like Comcast and Verizon slow down or censor websites and apps. His plan would make the Internet slower and more expensive, and it would make censorship for profit the norm. 
 
We can stop this like we stopped SOPA, TPP, and ACTA. We just need to make it clear that Pai‚Äôs plan is **toxic** so that no one in Washington wants anything to do with it. 
 
Here‚Äôs what we can do. There are 8 members of Congress currently egging the FCC on and helping Pai gut net neutrality. They recently put their names on a [statement of support](https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/bicameral-leaders-comment-pai-s-internet-regulations-announcement) or expressed their support in a [document of anti-net neutrality talking points](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728775-GOP-Member-Toolkit-FCC-Open-Internet-Order-5-2017.html) to show that Pai has some congressional backing.  
 
They‚Äôre hoping we don‚Äôt notice and that they won‚Äôt face a backlash, so we need to call out these members of Congress now to make sure other members of Congress stay away. That way we can starve Pai of the congressional backing he needs to push through his plan.
 
Here are the 8 members of Congress that are publicly supporting Pai‚Äôs attack on net neutrality:
 
* Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR)  (Twitter: [@RepGregWalden](https://twitter.com/repgregwalden); phone: 202-225-6730)
* Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)  (Twitter: [@MarshaBlackburn](https://twitter.com/MarshaBlackburn); phone: 202-225-2811)
* Sen. John Thune (R-SD)  (Twitter: [@johnthune](https://twitter.com/johnthune); phone: 202-224-2321)
* Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS)  (Twitter: [@RogerWicker](https://twitter.com/rogerwicker); phone: 202-224-6253)
* Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) (Twitter: [@SpeakerRyan](https://twitter.com/speakerryan); phone: 202-225-3031)
* Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA)  (Twitter: [@CathyMcMorris](https://twitter.com/cathymcmorris); phone: 202-225-2006)
* Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA)  (Twitter: [@RepTomGraves](https://twitter.com/reptomgraves); phone: 202-225-5211)
* Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH)  (Twitter: [@BobLatta](https://twitter.com/boblatta); phone: 202-225-6405)
 
All of these representatives and senators voted for the recent broadband privacy repeal bill as well. (Note: Paul Ryan did not formally vote on the broadband privacy bill because, by custom, the Speaker of the House does not vote on legislation unless their vote would be decisive. But, as Speaker, Ryan was responsible for bringing the bill to the floor to be voted on.)
 
**Call their offices, tweet at them, post on their Facebook walls. Tell them you are appalled by their support for Ajit Pai‚Äôs plan to kill net neutrality and that you will do everything in your power to hold them accountable for destroying the Internet.** 
 
We can‚Äôt let these members of Congress get away with supporting Pai‚Äôs plan, or else other members of Congress will think it‚Äôs safe to support it as well. We know the cable lobbyists are trying their best to get everyone in Congress to support Pai‚Äôs plan. It‚Äôs up to us to stand up and make them think twice before they mess with the Internet.

EDIT: [u/pperca rightly points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/di8hxda/) that another 8 senators have co-sponsored a bill that would repeal net neutrality. While their bill isn‚Äôt an explicit endorsement of Pai‚Äôs plan at the FCC, it‚Äôs basically a thinly veiled way of supporting Pai, so they deserve to be called out too.

"The CLOUD Act would let cops get our data directly from big tech companies like Facebook without needing a warrant. Congress just snuck it into the must-pass omnibus package. Congress just attached the CLOUD Act to the 2,232 page, must-pass [omnibus package](http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20180319/BILLS-115SAHR1625-RCP115-66.pdf). It's on page 2,201.

The so-called CLOUD Act would hand police departments in the U.S. and other countries new powers to directly collect data from tech companies instead of requiring them to first get a warrant. It would even let foreign governments wiretap inside the U.S. without having to comply with U.S. Wiretap Act restrictions.

Major tech companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Oath are [supporting](https://blogs.microsoft.com/datalaw/wp-content/uploads/sites/149/2018/02/Tech-Companies-Letter-of-Support-for-Senate-CLOUD-Act-020618.pdf) the bill because it makes their lives easier by relinquishing their responsibility to protect their users‚Äô data from cops. And they‚Äôve been throwing their lobby power behind getting the CLOUD Act attached to the omnibus government spending bill. 

Read more about the CLOUD Act from EFF [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/new-backdoor-around-fourth-amendment-cloud-act) and [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data), and the ACLU [here](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/internet-privacy/cloud-act-dangerous-piece-legislation) and [here](https://www.aclu.org/letter/coalition-letter-cloud-act).

There's certainly MANY other bad things in this omnibus package. But don't lose sight of this one. Passing the CLOUD Act would impact all of our privacy and would have serious implications.

"Reject the anti-encryption bill. These Senators are trying to damage privacy & security while everyone is distracted with Coronavirus! EFF made this easy tool so you can tell your senators. [**Link to EFF's easy tool to tell your senators.**](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill)

While  the media and people are distracted with COVID-19, two Senators have  been sneaking through an attack on privacy and online security.

Imagine an Internet where the law required every message sent to be  read by government-approved scanning software. Companies that handle  such messages wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to securely encrypt them, or they‚Äôd  lose  legal protections that allow them to operate.

[Take Action](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill)

That‚Äôs what the Senate Judiciary Committee has proposed and hopes to pass into law. The [so-called EARN IT bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text), sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), will [strip Section 230 protections](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/graham-blumenthal-bill-attack-online-speech-and-security)   away from any website that doesn‚Äôt follow a list of ‚Äúbest practices,‚Äù   meaning those sites can be sued into bankruptcy. The ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù list will be created by a government commission, headed by Attorney   General Barr, who has made it very clear he would like to ban   encryption, and guarantee law enforcement ‚Äúlegal access‚Äù to any digital message.¬†This is the next FOSTA - which was disaster for many users and small companies.

The EARN IT bill had  its first hearing March 12th, and its supporters‚Äô  strategy is clear. Because  they didn‚Äôt put the word ‚Äúencryption‚Äù in the bill, they‚Äôre going to  insist it doesn‚Äôt affect encryption.

‚ÄúThis  bill says nothing about encryption,‚Äù co-sponsor Sen. Blumenthal said  at today‚Äôs hearing. ‚ÄúHave you found a word in this bill about encryption?‚Äù he asked one witness.

It‚Äôs  true that the bill‚Äôs authors avoided using that word. But they did propose legislation that enables an all-out assault on encryption.  It would create a 19-person commission that‚Äôs completely controlled by  the  Attorney General and law enforcement agencies. And, at the hearing, a Vice-President at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) made it clear \[[PDF](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Shehan%20Testimony.pdf)\]   what he wants the best practices to be. NCMEC believes online services should be made to screen their messages for material that NCMEC considers abusive; use screening technology approved by NCMEC and law   enforcement; report what they find in the messages to NCMEC; and be held legally responsible for the content of messages sent by others.

You can‚Äôt have an Internet where messages are screened en masse, and also have end-to-end encryption any more than you can [create backdoors that can only be used by the good guys](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/there-no-middle-ground-encryption). The two are mutually exclusive. Concepts like ‚Äúclient-side scanning‚Äù aren‚Äôt a clever route around this; such scanning is [just another way to break end-to-end encryption](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption). Either the message remains private to everyone but its recipients, or it‚Äôs available to others.

The  19-person draft commission isn‚Äôt any better than the 15-person commission envisioned in an early draft of the bill. It‚Äôs completely dominated by law enforcement and allied groups like NCMEC. Not only will those groups have a majority of votes on the commission, but the bill gives Attorney General Barr the power to veto or approve the list of   best practices. Even if other commission members do disagree with law enforcement, Barr‚Äôs veto power will put him in a position to strongarm them.

The Commission won‚Äôt be a  body that seriously considers policy; it  will be a vehicle for creating  a law enforcement wish list. Barr has  made clear, [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/doj-and-fbi-show-no-signs-correcting-past-untruths-their-new-attacks-encryption) and [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/fancy-new-terms-same-old-backdoors-encryption-debate-2019) again, that breaking encryption is at the top of that wish list. Once   it‚Äôs broken, authoritarian regimes around the world will rejoice, as   they have the ability to add their own types of mandatory scanning, not   just for child sexual abuse material but for self-expression that those   governments want to suppress.¬†

The  privacy and security of all users will suffer if U.S. law  enforcement  is able to achieve its dream of breaking encryption.  Senators should  reject the EARN IT bill.

Despite all that, I have been repeatedly billed for $360 in Unreturned Equipment fees. I have of course repeatedly and firmly disputed the fees but have not been able to get them removed.

Every single step of my Comcast Equipment Return process is well documented [HERE] (http://www.buzzfeed.com/dannfuria/definitive-proof-it-is-impossible-to-avoid-comcast-wji6) and includes yet another Comcast audio recording.

Comcast additionally slammed me with a $960 Termination Fee for closing my account.

"With the recent Chinese company, Tencent, in the news about investing in Reddit, and possible censorship, it's amazing to me how so many people don't realize Reddit is already one of the most heavily censored websites on the internet. I was looking through these recent /r/technology threads:

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apcmtf/reddit_users_rally_against_chinese_censorship/

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apgfu6/winnie_the_pooh_takes_over_reddit_due_to_chinese/

And it seems that there are a lot (probably most) of people completely clueless about the widespread censorship that already occurs on reddit. And in addition, they somehow think they'll be able to tell when censorship occurs! 


&#x200B;

I [wrote about this](https://old.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/apig51/rtheoryofreddit_mods_remove_thread_and_all/) in a few different subs recently, which you can find in my submission history, but here are some main takeaways:

* Over the past 5+ years Reddit has gone from being the best site for extensive information sharing and lengthy discussion, to being one of the most censored sites on the internet, with many subs regularly secretly removing more than 40% of the content. With the Tencent investment it simply seems like censorship is officially a part of Reddit's business model. 

* A small amount of random people/mods who ""got there first"" control most of reddit. They are accountable to no one, and everyone is subject to the whims of their often capricious, self-serving, and abusive behavior. 


* Most of reddit is censored completely secretly. By default there is no notification or reason given when any content is removed. Mod teams have to make an effort to notify users and cite rules. Many/most mods do not bother with this. This can extend to bans as well, which can be done silently via automod configs. Modlogs are private by default and mod teams have to make an effort to make them public. 

* Reddit finally released the mod guidelines after years of complaints, but the admins do not enforce them. Many mods publicly boast about this fact. 

* The tools to see when censorship happens are ceddit.com, removeddit.com, revddit.com ([more info](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apu3oz/with_the_recent_chinese_company_tencent_in_the/eq83p0a/)), and using ""open in new private window"" for all your comments and submissions. You simply replace the ""reddit.com/r/w.e"" in the address to ceddit.com/r/w.e""

/r/undelete tracks things that were removed from the front page, but most censorship occurs well before a post makes it to the front page. 

There are a number of /r/RedditAlternatives that are trying to address the issues with reddit. 

EDIT: Guess I should mention a few notables:

"I set up my Raspberry Pi to automatically tweet at Comcast Xfinity whenever my internet speeds drop significantly below what I pay for https://twitter.com/a_comcast_user

I pay for 150mbps down and 10mbps up. The raspberry pi runs a series of speedtests every hour and stores the data. Whenever the downspeed is below 50mbps the Pi uses a twitter API to send an automatic tweet to Comcast listing the speeds. 

I know some people might say I should not be complaining about 50mpbs down, but when they advertise 150 and I get 10-30 I am unsatisfied. I am aware that the Pi that I have is limited to ~100mbps on its Ethernet port (but seems to top out at 90) so when I get 90 I assume it is also higher and possibly up to 150.

Comcast has noticed and every time I tweet they will reply asking for my account number and address...usually hours after the speeds have returned to normal values. I have chosen not to provide them my account or address because I do not want to singled out as a customer; all their customers deserve the speeds they advertise, not just the ones who are able to call them out on their BS.

The Pi also runs a website server local to our network where with a graphing library I can [see the speeds over different periods of time](http://i.imgur.com/qdnnLzg.png).



EDIT: A lot of folks have pointed out that the results are possibly skewed by our own network usage. We do not torrent in our house; we use the network to mainly stream TV services and play PC and Xbone live games. I set the speedtest and graph portion of this up (without the tweeting part) earlier last year when the service was so constatly bad that Netflix wouldn't go above 480p and I would have >500ms latencies in CSGO. I service was constantly below 10mbps down. I only added the Twitter portion of it recently and yes, admittedly the service has been better.

Plenty of the drops were during hours when we were not home or everyone was asleep, and I  am able to download steam games or stream Netflix at 1080p and still have the speedtest registers its near its maximum of ~90mbps down, so when we gets speeds on the order of 10mpbs down and we are not heavily using the internet we know the problem is not on our end.

EDIT 2: People asked for the source code. PLEASE USE THE CLEANED UP CODE BELOW. I am by no means some fancy programmer so there is no need to point out that my code is ugly or could be better. http://pastebin.com/WMEh802V

"Net neutrality day of action update: Twitter, Soundcloud, and Medium, have joined. Reddit, This could be as big as SOPA. Hey reddit, I wanted to give another quick update on the **[Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** planned for July 12th that tons of major websites, subreddits, online communities, and Internet users are helping organize.

The momentum is continuing to build. In the past few days Twitter, Soundcloud, Medium, Adblock, Twilio, and some other big names [have joined.](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-06-22-net-neutrality-day-of-action-gets-another-huge/) Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 80 subreddits!

We've started solidifying ideas for the types of messages that sites can display on the day of the protest, and you can [check those out here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/#join) (feedback is welcome!) 

EDIT: A little more info about the plan: on July 12 websites will display a prominent message on their homepage, and apps and services will send push notifications or do whatever makes the most sense for them to reach as many people as possible. We'll direct people to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com), an optimized action site that easily allows anyone to submit a comment to the FCC and Congress at the same time, make a phone call, and sign up to participate in meetings with lawmakers. We'll also have video bumpers that YouTubers and other video creators can use. Basically, everyone should think about how they can use the power of the Internet to reach their audience with a message abotu net neutrality and make it easy for them to take action.

**Important context from my previous update below.**

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the online content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this. ",normal

"Comcast‚Äôs Corporate response to my recent Reddit front page post (‚ÄúComcast‚Äôs Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees‚Äù) sends clear message: Comcast does not give a sh*t about customers ‚Äì unless your story goes national. *Before I can even begin to justify the very charged title of this post, I beg of you to please bear with me and allow me to share the entire context of what has transpired.*

I am Dann Furia, OP of [Comcast‚Äôs Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) which made the top spot on Reddit‚Äôs front page four days ago, highlighting a common Comcast phenomenon: customers getting repeatedly billed for ‚ÄúUnreturned‚Äù equipment and other fees.

**The purpose of this post is two-fold:**

* Share my (previously untold on Reddit) entire Comcast story
* Address Comcast‚Äôs response to my recent front page Reddit post about Comcast‚Äôs fees


**Part I - MY ENTIRE COMCAST STORY**

**During the six month period from mid-January of 2014 through the end of July of 2014, I had to contact Comcast an astounding 25 times in regards to a multitude of issues, errors, and mistakes with my service, and charges related to my Comcast account.**  I kept careful, written records of my experiences as far back as January of this year, and by early July I had experienced such a stupefying range of problems with Comcast, that I additionally began recording my interactions with them.

During the above-referenced six month period, Comcast was a thoroughly disconcerting 0 for 25 in resolving anything.  Now, I completely understand that it may seem rather farfetched for me to claim that a single company (even one as notorious as Comcast) could fail the same customer 25 consecutive times, that is until you consider that I have previously documented at length each of [25 Consecutive Failed Comcast Interactions here in a four page Comcast blog] (http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast) spanning 6 months, 17 phone calls, 6 appointments, 2 online interactions, 20+ hours of my personal time, and $1320 in fees) and further that I possess months of paperwork, 50+ pages of documents, files, images, bills, screen shots, phone records, and roughly two hours of audio recordings, to support my claims.  While my four page Comcast blog may not be the most exhilarating read, the entirety of the account - the sum of its parts, if you will - is in my opinion a damning indictment of Comcast customer handling.  At a minimum, my four page Comcast blog provides another well documented account of a relentlessly awful brand of service.


**Part 2 - COMCAST‚ÄôS RESPONSE TO MY FRONT PAGE REDDIT POST ABOUT COMCAST‚ÄôS NOTORIOUS FEES**

As noted above, I tried in earnest 25 times in a six month period from January through July of 2014 to get Comcast to help me.  Comcast steadfastly ignored, neglected, dodged, and billed the crap out of me.  Put more poignantly, Comcast played an incredibly effective game of ‚ÄúAnnoying you out of your money, wearing you down until you're too weak to complain, and then when you just can't go on, charge you for early cancellation. Or just make something up and put it on a bill and hope no one notices."" (Bill Maher, 7/25/14).

Then, *after* my [Comcast‚Äôs Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) post topped the Reddit front page four days ago and my story received national attention, Comcast‚Äôs Corporate office left me 5 messages in 18 hours.  I repeat - not a SINGLE Comcast employee could bother to help me one time in 6 months, despite my 25 well documented attempts to get help, and now all of the sudden Comcast has the ability to contact me 5 times in 18 hours?  That is interesting.

When I listened to the first voicemail from Comcast Corporate, I felt relieved that someone might actually finally help me.  But by the time I made my way through five consecutive Comcast Corporate messages (4 of them from the same person), and realized that they had all been delivered in an 18 hour period directly after my ‚ÄúComcast fees‚Äù post went Reddit-viral, I literally began to feel sick to my stomach by Comcast‚Äôs response.  Now, I understand that when a Comcast customer story like mine starts to get national attention, Comcast probably tries to minimize whatever gripes might publicly emerge.  I also concede ‚Äì flat out ‚Äì a measure of hypocrisy on my part for reacting partly in anger that Comcast finally responded to me.  Having said that, there could not possibly be a more poignant, scathing illustration of the contrast between Comcast‚Äôs treatment of a regular customer (contemptuously disregarded 25 times in 6 months) and a ‚ÄúSpecial / Going Public‚Äù customer (5 Corporate messages in 18 hours).

All indications are that Comcast has just now (as of about 3 days ago) taken notice of a customer - who for several years has resided in their backyard, the suburbs of Philadelphia ‚Äì and begun to address but one of many unfortunate aspects of my Comcast experience (the $1320 in fees aspect).  I, meanwhile, have had 7 months to bake in the rancor of Comcast Purgatory, a dimension from which very few, if any, escape.  So please allow me, indulge me if you would be so kind, to summarize how this feels from my perspective:  In a six month period this year, Comcast mishandled my account 25 times in a row, put me on hold on the phone for several hours, failed to show up to multiple appointments, hung up on me while I was on hold, fed me a torrent of misinformation (much of which is recorded on audio, mine and theirs), threatened me with and then auto-generated to my account a Literally-Unremovable $960 Termination Fee, repeatedly billed me $360 for properly returning my equipment, and wasted way more than 20 hours of my time.

Comcast‚Äôs effective response in helping me during the six month time frame? Zero. Zilch. None. Null. Devoid.
Comcast‚Äôs response when I cancelled my account?  They buried me $1320 in fees.
Comcast‚Äôs response when I went public to complain?  Their Corporate office immediately contacted me 5 times in 18 hours.

**And so this appears to be the standard for receiving attention from a Comcast representative who actually has the ability or power to address problems that Comcast has caused a customer:** First, a customer should suffer through months of negligence and poor treatment, documenting each step of the journey while firmly battling a motley assortment of heinous fees, then after 6 months utterly give up all hope and feel like a fool for bothering to try so hard to get Comcast to help you, then ‚Äì if you can manage to find the time - write a [4 page blog about your Comcast experience](http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast), then [share part of your story with Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/), be fortunate enough to receive incredible & overwhelming support that vaults your post to the Reddit front page, and gain some national coverage (from The Verge, Gawker, & International Business Times).  Perhaps then - and only then - can a customer get Comcast to clean up a mess they‚Äôve created.

It appears, for the time being, that I might just escape from Comcastic Purgatory.  

But believe me when I say this with heartfelt sincerity: I feel genuinely sorry for the rest of you poor souls.",normal

"Guys, M√©xico has no net neutrality laws. This is what it really looks like. No mockup, glimpse into a possible future for the US. (Image in post) Firstoff, I absolutely support Net Neutrality Laws. 

[Here's a screencapture for cellphone data plans in M√©xico](http://imgur.com/yYobj7x), which show how carriers basically discriminate data use based on which social network you browse/consume.

I wanted to post this here because I keep finding all these mockups about how Net Neutrality ""might look"" which -albeit correct in it's assumptions- get wrong the business model end of what companies would do with their power.

Basically, what the mockups show... a world where ""regular price for top companies vs pay an extra if you're a small company"", non-net neutral competition in M√©xico is actually based on who gives away more ""free app time"". Eg: ""You can order 3 Uber rides for free, no data use, with us!""

Which I guess makes more sense. The point is still the same though... ISPs are looking inside your data packets to make these content discrimination decisions.

"Any older gamers finding they are losing interest? Almost 40, being playing video games since I was 5 and finding that games just don't hold my attention like they use to.  I feel like part of it is the predictability factor/lack of originality in gaming.  Just played the first 20 minutes of the Dead Space remake and although I could see the appeal I just didn't feel immersed in the game.  I just sat there thinking ""Oh, and this jump scare will pop up here...and I was right....and then I'll think I'm safe but monster will appe...yup, there he is"".  And this didn't always happen for me.  Historically I've been really bad at predicting what would happen next in a game/movie/show.  I remember constantly being surprised by things in games growing up but now I feel a really big lack of originality in what I play.  There are exceptions over the last 5 years for me (What Happened To Edith Finch, Persona 5, Final Fantasy Remake, HZD) but I can't count how many games I've installed, played 30 minutes of and then just walked away.  I remember visceral feelings from running through Link To The Past, Gears of War 1 and Arkham Knight.  I miss that.

"I don't finish games anymore. I'm just curious if others have found themselves in my situation. I don't care to beat the final boss/level/mission of any game I play now. My last three games where Mario Wonder, Sekiro, Black Myth: Wukong. I have deeply enjoyed all of these games but I have found my enthusiasm plummet when I reach the final part of the game....to the point that I have no interest in finishing them.

I think this occurs for several reasons. 

1. I know the game will end so the discovery aspect of the game is now gone and that is a major motivator for me.

2. I'm sick of the arbitrarily hard ending to games. Why? What value does it give a game to make the ending much harder than the rest of the game? 

3. I know I'm wasting my time putting extra hours into the game when I can just move on to a new game. 

I'm sure there are other reasons but those are the one that stand out to me. I'm curious to hear other people's opinion about this.

Edit: 
Another redditor posted an opinion that I 100% agree with. ""I still finish games a lot but I usually reach a hiatus near the end because I'm a little sad to finish the game if I've enjoyed it so I stop to savor it.""",normal

Also, if you are going through something difficult, it is always good to get support from people around you. I think a game can't really replace our need for IRL human connection. It's okay to use a game as a crutch for awhile, but don't forget to ask for help from people around you.",normal

"DA: Veilguard as a cheap escape for a series fan? I stopped pre ordering games in 2010 and 60% of games I get excited for I wait months for patches and a sale. I realized developers come and go from BioWare but they are my favorite studio and the one exclusion to my purchase habits.

I wanted veilguard day one if the reviews were good as I grew up on and adore dragon age. I heard some controversy about review code timing and complaints about writing, but the series is one of my all time favorite series. So as long as those parts were decent and the gameplay was solid I‚Äôm sold.
I've only seen brief clips as I want to go in blind but I'm starting to hear both positivity and negativity from the community. As an EA game I fully expected this to drop maybe 15-20 dollars on Black Friday, and I was gong to try to swing it then or for Christmas. Now it‚Äôs my birthday and instead of DA:V I have surprise medical bills for my heart and spontaneously have to fight for custody of my kid. Pardon my French but shit has hit the fan recently and I need and escape I won‚Äôt bounce off. Thankfully I haven't had to sell my ps5 for attorney fees yet as I was looking forward to this game the most after a tough year.

Could it get down to $25ish on Black Friday? Because I could swing that with a trade in, though even then it's weeks away and with the varying reception I've heard I have no clue how deep of a sale to expect. I just want to be in a light hearted fantasy setting where my world irl isn't falling apart ha. Thanks for any and all insight! I don‚Äôt purchase many EA games",normal
"Looking for a game for a study Hi, I'm doing some research to find a game to use for a psychology study, and I was wondering if any of y'all would have suggestions?

There are two main axis of control we're looking for in a game, that being the level of violence, and indirect vs direct competition.

For clarification, indirect competition refers to competition where you are not interacting directly with your opponent. Direct is when you are directly interacting with your opponent.

Additionally, the subject will be playing against a bot, not an actual player, so the game needs to support that, and ideally has multiple levels of difficulty for said bots.

One game which encompasses this all is ideal, but I realize not the most realistic, so breaking this into multiple games could also work, just as long as at least one degree of control is present (such as an explicitly violent game which still has the indirect/direct options), and we can find an accompanying title to fill the other gaps.

"Any completionists out there that never finish games? I love me some RPGs. Ever since FF2, it's been my favorite genre.

But then FF12 came about, and if you opened 1 random chest in the wrong place, you lost out on one of the best weapons in the game. Now...you can't miss a thing, or you miss out. 

I loot every container. Read every guide. Make sure I don't miss a single detail. And I haven't completed an RPG story in years. Pick em up, play the shit out of them, looking in every corner and back alley, then get bored of it because I'm not really playing a game any more.

The exact same performance, and everything is the same. In Tropico 6 my frames crashed my Base PS5, but not the Pro, yet they were practically the same outcome. I maxed out the performance to a halt. 


Yeah I'm disappointed. This console should be able to do much more for older games. I would refund this thing if I could, but I bought it from GameStop. The base PS5 is good enough. 



Not everyone will have the same experience, but I just wanted improvement for my current games that were struggling on the current hardware. 




Edit: I own like 3 games that could take full potential of it's power out of my entire PlayStation library. I fell for marketing.

"Next James Bond game will be a Game As A Service, follows Hitman strategy ‚ÄúYou have this strong core single-player experience, and then you carefully layer on live-services elements around this core, and then you expand in‚Ä¶ these concentric circles from there and create a single-player-as-a-service that can be a very, very good business and very durable,‚Äù says Daugaard. ‚ÄúWe think that is a more organic approach than launching a super expensive, mega live-services game and hope that people will show up.‚Äù

"Trying to remember an early 2000s 'game' that replaced the desktop I remember I had what I think was a game, or maybe just a fun program, but it turned your desktop into a game and you ran around to open programs and like webpage links, etc. I might be totally off and just imagining it. 

I cant remember if it was with guns or swords or anything, if it even existed. Might have came with a GPU/CPU, I was too young to understand at the time, dad installed it for me but he doesn't remember. Time period I'm thinking is before 2007?

"Instant Fanboy Is there any game out there that made you an instant fanboy of a particular franchise or genre? For example, **Space Marine 2** blew the doors down for me into the **Warhammer 40K** universe. I've since bought a ton of games and have been enthused by its lore, and I'm looking to start the art of collecting the miniatures. Another for me would be **Resident Evil 7: Biohazard**. I had not played or watched anything from the franchise before, but I suddenly found myself binge-watching all the movies (both live-action and animated), and buying most of the games and remakes.

"Please recommend me a game where all the NPC's act like your hype man For example, In ace combat 7, you are a face less voiceless protagonist, but through the campaign, your skills are recognised by the NPC and slowly you start to be like their hero, I think in one of the missions the guy in the radio starts shouting about how I was the only one who can do this. 

Similarly in earth defence force 5, i think the game was, the hype increases slowly through the missions and in the last mission against the powerful alien, the guy talking to you through the radio starts hyping me crazily like how I can do it, how I am the one who is inbetween life and death of the world. Or something like that

So preferably a game where my character doesn't have dialogues, I find that Japanese games do this best. So any recommendations like that? 

I know many RPG has this, like chosen one, Dragonborne, and the likes. But the feeling from Ace combat and EDF was different. It felt like I was being hyped not because of some chosen power, but just because of my skill being recognised and being depended upon. (Just going through a rough patch in life. I sort of need this.)",normal

"How long should a game be out before it can be declared an all-time great? It‚Äôs too easy to enjoy a game at release and quickly declare it to be one of the greatest of all time, but as many of us have experienced, not all games that are great initially stay great forever. As time passes, the gameplay can grow stale, the story can become less enjoyable, updates (if applicable) can ruin more than they fix, etc.

This doesn‚Äôt even include the longer-term effects that can change a game‚Äôs place in history. For instance, does the look and feel age well? Does it inspire others to model themselves after the game? Does it create or perfect something that continues to set the standard years (perhaps decades) later?

Personally, I would never consider a game to be in the discussion of ‚Äúall-time great‚Äù until at least five years have passed since its release. I need to see how it holds up to the test of time significantly first.

"Souls-lite games for beginners? Does anyone know of beginner friendly souls games? And I mean, hold my hand and pat my head levels of beginner. I absolutely adore the aesthetics in souls games, I would love to play them, but I'm in a place in my life where I can't focus on difficult games and I have no fun in conquering my frustration to beat the game into submission.

Is there a starting point, a game that has a low difficulty curve so I can take my sweet time building skills until I'm ready for big boy games?

My first experience was going in blind in Dark Souls 1, getting repeatedly destroyed by the first encounters, going NOPE!, and uninstalling (I was completely unaware the struggle was the entire point). I'm used to hack and slash, button mash, fast paced, low consequences for getting hit kind of games.

I'm stubborn and keep trying soulslike games in the hopes that one of them will be easier. So far I tried and failed to have fun with: Blasphemous, Death's Gambit, Grime, Moonscars. They're all 2D cause I can't pull the trigger on Elden Ring or Ghost of Tsushima, feels like a lot of money to spend on something I'm never going to play.

Edit: all of you are amazing, RIP my steam wishlist, but excited to give souls games another go!",normal

"Going from Watch Dog 1 to 2 is like going back to schoolyard as an adult I just beaten Watch Dog 1 and started Watch Dog 2. And oh man what a shock ! 

In WD 1, the world is so real. The story is for grown ups. The basic plot is someone tried to murder you after a failed hack at a fancy hotel and killed your little niece instead. You know somebody betrayed you. You're on the path of vengeance to find and punish those responsible for that.

Subplots mission includes searching for a serial killer, closing down an illegal weapon ring or a forced prostitution ring.

The vehicles and the guns all feel real. The police is a real pain in the ass to get rid off. Their is this mega computer surveillance thing called CTOS and the big company behind that's blume. There are important part of the story but not the main part.

In WD 2, the world feel like an amusement park. The plot is just that CTOS sucks and that's not cool, so you and your crew of over the caricature of nerds are gonna tear it down. And the way to do it is to acquire followers that basically lend you their computer's power as long as they follow you.

One of the first side mission is about preventing a billionaire to keep some rappers' new album all by himself...

The guns and vehicles are a joke. The police too.

If you have any other examples from around this time period, feel free to point them out in the comments :)

1. Arkham Knight (2015)  
Do I need to elaborate? Honestly it holds up super super well even after almost 10 years. I love how the water looks, the character models, textures, everything.

  
2. Titanfall 2 (2016)

One that I could actually run on my laptop, thanks to the adaptive resolution features. Once I get a better one, I need to play this at max settings, it looks amazing.

3. Dishonored 2 (2016)  
While the first Dishonored holds up well imo, if you look closely the textures have definitely aged. But I can't say the same for the sequel, I just adore the way Dishonored games look.

4. Deus ex: Mankind Divided (2016)  
I think this might be the best looking game on this list.

I wanted veilguard day one if the reviews were good as I grew up on and adore dragon age. I heard some controversy about review code timing and complaints about writing, but the series is one of my all time favorite series. So as long as those parts were decent and the gameplay was solid I‚Äôm sold.
I've only seen brief clips as I want to go in blind but I'm starting to hear both positivity and negativity from the community. As an EA game I fully expected this to drop maybe 15-20 dollars on Black Friday, and I was gong to try to swing it then or for Christmas.

Pardon my French but shit has hit the fan recently and I need and escape I won‚Äôt bounce off.

Could it get down to $25ish on Black Friday?

"I don't finish games anymore. I'm just curious if others have found themselves in my situation. I don't care to beat the final boss/level/mission of any game I play now. My last three games where Mario Wonder, Sekiro, Black Myth: Wukong. I have deeply enjoyed all of these games but I have found my enthusiasm plummet when I reach the final part of the game....to the point that I have no interest in finishing them.

I think this occurs for several reasons. 

1. I know the game will end so the discovery aspect of the game is now gone and that is a major motivator for me.

2. I'm sick of the arbitrarily hard ending to games. Why? What value does it give a game to make the ending much harder than the rest of the game? 

3. I know I'm wasting my time putting extra hours into the game when I can just move on to a new game. 

I'm sure there are other reasons but those are the one that stand out to me. I'm curious to hear other people's opinion about this.

"Looking for a game for a study Hi, I'm doing some research to find a game to use for a psychology study, and I was wondering if any of y'all would have suggestions?

There are two main axis of control we're looking for in a game, that being the level of violence, and indirect vs direct competition.

For clarification, indirect competition refers to competition where you are not interacting directly with your opponent. Direct is when you are directly interacting with your opponent.

Additionally, the subject will be playing against a bot, not an actual player, so the game needs to support that, and ideally has multiple levels of difficulty for said bots.

One game which encompasses this all is ideal, but I realize not the most realistic, so breaking this into multiple games could also work, just as long as at least one degree of control is present (such as an explicitly violent game which still has the indirect/direct options), and we can find an accompanying title to fill the other gaps. 

Any response is appreciated, and have a nice day!",normal

"Any older gamers finding they are losing interest? Almost 40, being playing video games since I was 5 and finding that games just don't hold my attention like they use to.  I feel like part of it is the predictability factor/lack of originality in gaming.  Just played the first 20 minutes of the Dead Space remake and although I could see the appeal I just didn't feel immersed in the game.  I just sat there thinking ""Oh, and this jump scare will pop up here...and I was right....and then I'll think I'm safe but monster will appe...yup, there he is"".  And this didn't always happen for me.  Historically I've been really bad at predicting what would happen next in a game/movie/show.  I remember constantly being surprised by things in games growing up but now I feel a really big lack of originality in what I play.  There are exceptions over the last 5 years for me (What Happened To Edith Finch, Persona 5, Final Fantasy Remake, HZD) but I can't count how many games I've installed, played 30 minutes of and then just walked away.  I remember visceral feelings from running through Link To The Past, Gears of War 1 and Arkham Knight.  I miss that.

"I just wasted $470 on the PS5 Pro.  So basically if this game doesn't have a PS5 PRO ENHANCED patch, games with an uncapped frame rate will not perform any different. Digital Foundry found some games that had a 10 frame difference. 


I just played Tropico 6 and cities skylines with old maps I stopped playing on my base PS5 because the performance started to suffer. I tested my base PS5 first, and then the Pro. The exact same performance, and everything is the same. In Tropico 6 my frames crashed my Base PS5, but not the Pro, yet they were practically the same outcome. I maxed out the performance to a halt. 


Yeah I'm disappointed. This console should be able to do much more for older games. I would refund this thing if I could, but I bought it from GameStop. The base PS5 is good enough. 



Not everyone will have the same experience, but I just wanted improvement for my current games that were struggling on the current hardware. 




Edit: I own like 3 games that could take full potential of it's power out of my entire PlayStation library. I fell for marketing. 




I'm not testing frame capped games at 30... I was expecting uncapped games to perform better just like the PS5 was able to brute force PS4 games to 60 without a patch with ease.

"How long should a game be out before it can be declared an all-time great? It‚Äôs too easy to enjoy a game at release and quickly declare it to be one of the greatest of all time, but as many of us have experienced, not all games that are great initially stay great forever. As time passes, the gameplay can grow stale, the story can become less enjoyable, updates (if applicable) can ruin more than they fix, etc.

This doesn‚Äôt even include the longer-term effects that can change a game‚Äôs place in history. For instance, does the look and feel age well? Does it inspire others to model themselves after the game? Does it create or perfect something that continues to set the standard years (perhaps decades) later?

Personally, I would never consider a game to be in the discussion of ‚Äúall-time great‚Äù until at least five years have passed since its release. I need to see how it holds up to the test of time significantly first.

"Souls-lite games for beginners? Does anyone know of beginner friendly souls games? And I mean, hold my hand and pat my head levels of beginner. I absolutely adore the aesthetics in souls games, I would love to play them, but I'm in a place in my life where I can't focus on difficult games and I have no fun in conquering my frustration to beat the game into submission.

Is there a starting point, a game that has a low difficulty curve so I can take my sweet time building skills until I'm ready for big boy games?

My first experience was going in blind in Dark Souls 1, getting repeatedly destroyed by the first encounters, going NOPE!, and uninstalling (I was completely unaware the struggle was the entire point). I'm used to hack and slash, button mash, fast paced, low consequences for getting hit kind of games.

I'm stubborn and keep trying soulslike games in the hopes that one of them will be easier. So far I tried and failed to have fun with: Blasphemous, Death's Gambit, Grime, Moonscars. They're all 2D cause I can't pull the trigger on Elden Ring or Ghost of Tsushima, feels like a lot of money to spend on something I'm never going to play.

Edit: all of you are amazing, RIP my steam wishlist, but excited to give souls games another go!",normal

"How do y'all fell about map fog (map is only uncovered in places you've been before)? I absolutely despise this mechanic because I get the urge to uncover as much of the map as I can. 

Best example for me is Far Cry 6. In Far Cry 5 and 6 map is only uncovered in places you've been before (BUT IT DOESN'T COUNT IF YOU USE A PLANE OR HELICOPTER). However I cheesed it simply due to a vehicle that is a dune buggy of sorts with a large plane propeller and you can fly at low to mid altitudes. Therefore the game considers it a land vehicle and you can explore to your hearts desire.

In Far cry 5 however if I want to uncover everything I have to either hike or drive EVERYWHERE. And the map is much more mountainous compared to 6 which has them but they're more spread out",normal

I played the game for months, repeating that code each time I played, one day I noticed, while playing as Tails, his name was changed to Miles on the screen. This code changed every instance of Tails to Miles in the game.

"2015-2016 were such amazing years for game graphics (Examples in desc.) No real point to this post, I just wanted to talk about how 2015 and 2016 had some amazing looking games in terms of art style. I'm not someone to really care about graphics, but these stuck out to me.

If you have any other examples from around this time period, feel free to point them out in the comments :)

1. Arkham Knight (2015)  
Do I need to elaborate? Honestly it holds up super super well even after almost 10 years. I love how the water looks, the character models, textures, everything.

  
2. Titanfall 2 (2016)

One that I could actually run on my laptop, thanks to the adaptive resolution features. Once I get a better one, I need to play this at max settings, it looks amazing.

3. Dishonored 2 (2016)  
While the first Dishonored holds up well imo, if you look closely the textures have definitely aged. But I can't say the same for the sequel, I just adore the way Dishonored games look.

4. Deus ex: Mankind Divided (2016)  
I think this might be the best looking game on this list.

"Please recommend me a game where all the NPC's act like your hype man For example, In ace combat 7, you are a face less voiceless protagonist, but through the campaign, your skills are recognised by the NPC and slowly you start to be like their hero, I think in one of the missions the guy in the radio starts shouting about how I was the only one who can do this. 

Similarly in earth defence force 5, i think the game was, the hype increases slowly through the missions and in the last mission against the powerful alien, the guy talking to you through the radio starts hyping me crazily like how I can do it, how I am the one who is inbetween life and death of the world. Or something like that

So preferably a game where my character doesn't have dialogues, I find that Japanese games do this best. So any recommendations like that? 

I know many RPG has this, like chosen one, Dragonborne, and the likes. But the feeling from Ace combat and EDF was different.

No spoilers, but the reason dead space is so good is uncovering the mysteries behind the story for the first time. And the tension that comes with exploring the ship and finding clues. To me, replaying the game would mean all that magic and intrigue is gone.

"Understanding Remasters, Remakes, Reboots, and More: A Simple Guide I‚Äôve noticed people using terms like¬†*remaster*,¬†*remake*,¬†*reboot*, and others pretty loosely, so I thought it‚Äôd be fun to try breaking them down with a few examples. This isn‚Äôt definitive, just a way to explore how differently games evolve over time. Would love to hear any thoughts or suggestions!

**Enhanced Edition**  
Minor upgrades for compatibility with modern hardware, typically with improved assets or quality-of-life changes, while staying close to the original.

*Examples:*¬†*Quake Enhanced*,¬†*Baldur‚Äôs Gate Enhanced Edition*,¬†*Planescape: Torment Enhanced Edition*

**Remaster**  
Improved visuals, audio, and minor tweaks, usually using the same game code, preserving the original experience for newer platforms or celebrating a legacy.

*Examples:*¬†*The Last of Us Remastered*,¬†*Dark Souls Remastered*,¬†*Wind Waker HD*,¬†*Skyrim: Special Edition*

**Remake**  
A faithful recreation that keeps core characters and story but is rebuilt with modern graphics and gameplay, aiming to feel like a fresh version of the original.

*Examples:*¬†*Resident Evil 2*¬†(2019),¬†*Shadow of the Colossus*¬†(PS4),¬†*Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Demon Souls*

**Reimagining**  
A retelling that reworks the original story and gameplay with significant changes, while still drawing from the source for a familiar yet fresh experience.

*Examples:*¬†*Final Fantasy VII Rebirth*,¬†*XCOM: Enemy Unknown*,¬†*Metroid: Samus Returns*,¬†*Ratchet & Clank*¬†(2016)

**Reboot**  
A fresh start for a franchise that resets continuity and offers a clean slate, often with new stories or reinterpreted lore.

*Examples:*¬†*DOOM*¬†(2016),¬†*Tomb Raider*¬†(2013),¬†*Mortal Kombat*¬†(2011),¬†*DmC: Devil May Cry*

**Retelling**  
An adaptation that reinterprets a story from another medium (like a book or movie) in game form, introducing new elements or perspectives and taking creative liberties.

*Examples:*¬†*The Witcher*¬†(based on the novels),¬†*Jurassic Park: The Game*,¬†*Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*

**Spiritual Successor**  
A new game inspired by a previous title, capturing similar themes or mechanics but existing as a standalone experience.

*Examples:*¬†*Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night*¬†(spiritual successor to¬†*Castlevania*),¬†*Yooka-Laylee*¬†(*Banjo-Kazooie*),¬†*Outer Worlds*¬†(*Fallout: New Vegas*)

"Games with Unlabeled/Unrequested ""Quests?""  
So I've always been a huge fan of the concept where just talking to NPCs can reveal a trouble they have, and then you can resolve it if you so happen to stumble upon a solution or answer for them, without the game ever actually acknowledging it as a quest. 

As an example, I'm currently playing Black Sigil and there is a guard who lost track of some kids he's supposed to be babysitting, but he just says this as an idle complaint, not asking you to do anything about it. If you see and talk to the kids, you can come back and tell the guard (and he just kind of snaps at you, but that's beside the point).

I believe Radiant Historia had side quests similar to this too, where you might not always know if it's a quest or just flavor text because the game doesn't explicitly tell you. 

What are some other games that have a lot of these types of interactions? Any system is fine.

Thank you!!",normal

"Unpopular opinion - A Focus on cinematic cutscenes is ruining modern gaming by bloating development time and costs A some point in the last 40 years, video gaming began moving from a gameplay focused medium (coin-operated arcades, atari, colecovision, NES) towards a storytelling-focused medium, requiring cutscenes and Full motion video segments (Playstation, 486, Amiga, etc). There are lots of examples of this that worked through gaming history, but there is no denying this shift. Video games have inched closer and closer towards films with every passing year. 

I propose that this portion of video game development has begun to dwarf the portion devoted to making compelling gameplay, and as a result development costs have skyrocketed and development times have become bloated and overlong. A game like Concord, for example, might have been a success, had its development focused on the gameplay and the planned release. Thinking about just how much time and money was wasted attempting to build a story with regularly released cutscenes to flesh out the characters, for what amounts to a PVP shooter --- it feels like the whole industry needs a reality check.",normal

"A hidden GEM that deserves more LOVE! Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered just recently came out in the last few days and it is an incredible blast from the past. The original game came out in 2011 and it delivered exactly what it promised, a fun time - but unfortunately it fell under the radar and never got a chance for a sequel. Now it's back again with a remaster at a bargain $25 price. 

It's a collaboration between Shinji Mikami, who is known for the legendary Resident Evil & Resident Evil 4 games with Suda 51, who directed ""No More Heroes"" and ""Killer7,"" AND music composed by Akira Yamaoka who does the soundtrack for the Silent Hill series. This was a dream team and they released a BOMB game that will offer you a phenomenal time with a dose of nostalgia of the 360 era. 

Picture yourself as a badass tattooed Mexican Demon-hunter (Gracia F*****g Hotspur) who wears a purple leather jacket and a Demon Skull companion who transforms into his variety of guns, his torch, and his motorcycle which he rides straight down to Hell to save his blonde-bombshell girlfriend after being kidnapped by the Demon King. Transcend a unique and artistic depiction of the underworld and have a blast. Short, sweet, straightforward and totally worth it.

"[No DAV Spoilers] I‚Äôm Incredibly Indifferent About DAV‚Ä¶ [No DAV Spoilers] I‚Äôm Incredibly Indifferent about DAV‚Ä¶

Ok no spoilers, but I‚Äôm 15 hours into DAV. Now I‚Äôm a huge BioWare fan, and have been since KOTOR.

Of their games Mass Effect is what I‚Äôd consider their magnum opus, and is the epitome of what I believe their games should resemble in terms of writing, decisions, characters, etc‚Ä¶

That said, I‚Äôve always enjoyed the DA series but was never in love with it the same way some fans are. I think it‚Äôs a cooler high fantasy universe, with some interesting takes on existing fantasy tropes. Regardless I always considered DA to have the same level of passion and quality put into it by BioWare as they did with Mass Effect.

My expectations for DAV were incredibly low, given the last two BioWare entires fell flat for me (Anthem, ME: Andromeda). So no, I wasn‚Äôt expecting them to really deliver anything great. 

Now DAV isn‚Äôt an outright ‚Äúbad‚Äù game on paper. I think the combat is satisfying despite the lack of any true enemy variety. This lack of variety is also why I think it‚Äôs already starting to feel incredibly repetitive only 15 hours in. The loot while aesthetically nice to look at, feels like it‚Äôs very mobile game in design, especially with how you level up certain pieces of loot.

The worlds are beautiful unsurprisingly, since I‚Äôve always felt that one of BioWares strongest aspects have been its art direction for environments. But I‚Äôd argue out of all of DAV‚Äôs design aspects its levels and ‚Äúopen spaces‚Äù feel unapologetically like asset flips from their original DA service title. That said, they do at least attempt to make these spaces interesting after you complete main missions. But when running through these levels, it‚Äôs painfully clear how much of the DA service game makes up DAV‚Äôs bones/DNA.

However to me those things aren‚Äôt the biggest issue I have, b/c ultimately I don‚Äôt mind a lot of the systems & mechanics I‚Äôve already mentioned, mainly b/c there not overly egregious. I say that, b/c in RPGs I can push through a lot of bad systems, combat, etc‚Ä¶ if the writing and characters are great.

So far, DAV feels almost identical in its tone, writing, and characters as ME: Andromeda did, which for myself personally, is a huge disappointment. 

Whenever I‚Äôve talked about Andromedas writing in comparison to the original trilogy, the example I always use is, if the original trilogy‚Äôs writing was Star Trek NG, meaning it‚Äôs well thought out, nuanced, layered, and able to balance the serious themes with moments of genuine levity. ME Andromeda is the equivalent of FOX‚Äôs Terra Nova show. Meaning it‚Äôs bland, basic, surface level, lacking all of the interesting depth the original trilogy had.

As it stands, this is exactly how DAV‚Äôs writing feels. I thought ppl were joking at launch when talking about how cookie cutter the writing was. But after 15 hours that has been proven multiple times over now.

The dialogue feels so stiff and sterile. It completely lacks any different voices or perspective, and feels like a CW, YA show for a lot of the conversations. It‚Äôs almost like you can tell the writers aren‚Äôt passionate about this games script in the slightest.

It‚Äôs been so jarring just hearing these characters speak to one another, since most of the conversations don‚Äôt make these characters feel real or immersive in anyway.

This aspect is ultimately having me questioning if I‚Äôm going to complete DAV right now. I‚Äôve also been playing Metaphor which narratively is leagues above DAV in almost every single way. 

I‚Äôve heard some of the narratively is greatly improved towards the end, but idk, I‚Äôm having such a hard time buying into these characters, but like the combat enough to keep playing for the moment.

"Going from Watch Dog 1 to 2 is like going back to schoolyard as an adult I just beaten Watch Dog 1 and started Watch Dog 2. And oh man what a shock ! 

In WD 1, the world is so real. The story is for grown ups. The basic plot is someone tried to murder you after a failed hack at a fancy hotel and killed your little niece instead. You know somebody betrayed you. You're on the path of vengeance to find and punish those responsible for that.

Subplots mission includes searching for a serial killer, closing down an illegal weapon ring or a forced prostitution ring.

The vehicles and the guns all feel real. The police is a real pain in the ass to get rid off. Their is this mega computer surveillance thing called CTOS and the big company behind that's blume. There are important part of the story but not the main part.

In WD 2, the world feel like an amusement park. The plot is just that CTOS sucks and that's not cool, so you and your crew of over the caricature of nerds are gonna tear it down. And the way to do it is to acquire followers that basically lend you their computer's power as long as they follow you.

"Why do people like Nintendo? (Read before downvoting, there's a reason behind the question) My wife is an avid Nintendo fan, having bought Wii, WiiU and Switch (Lite and the normal console)...  
Most games do not perform well, they often lag and seem like they weren't actually designed for the console they were specifically designed for.

Now, to what triggered this post, my wife bought Disney Dreamlight Valley (why? beyond me) on the Switch and quickly noticed it is quite laggy, does not perform well enough to be enjoyable. She sees in the receipt email that you have 14 days right of cancellation. She then asks me to contact Nintendo and ask if they can refund the game since it is not performing the way she expected. (Asking me to do this because her English isn't great)

I call Nintendo on the number provided in the email to ask for a refund on the game, as it is not performing well. The agent on the phone informs me that ""When you buy a digital game, you need to check in a box that says you waive the right of cancellation"", so there is no right of cancellation?

In order for us to get a refund of 35¬£, the hoops I was asked to jump through are as follows:  
Nintendo sending out Troubleshooting steps (which I can tell you right now, will do not do anything)  
Contact the developer for the game and ask them if they will patch it, WHEN they answer (not if) that they CANNOT fix it then I can send that response to Nintendo and they will escalate it.

If you got this far, I can understand if you love Nintendo franchises, they do have a few good ones (I think the games play like shit on their consoles but the games aren't inherently bad) but why would ANYONE support Nintendo?

"What games excel in romance, whether it be an optional companion romance , or even a canon, main story romance? The new Dragon Age's romances are really disappointing. It feels like they hardly impact the storyline, and it never feels like you are actually in a relationship with the companion, more like a very close friend for the few scenes the game actually remembers that you romanced a character. 

I've always found that companion romances have been a core part of the Bioware formula, so it's really disappointing to compare Veilguards' romance to the previous  games, namely Dragon Age: Origins.

 The romance questline for Morrigan was a core part of my memories of that game, watching her slowly fall for the player character, and subsequently, change for the better as she found someone that she truly cared for and wanted to be her real self for, dropping the act she was putting on (and would have continued putting on if you didn't engage in her romance questline), overcoming the harsh teachings of her mother that caused her to put up a wall. Choosing to romance her also played a core part in the games main narrative and it really felt impactful, Morrigan became your character's lover, and it mattered in the game world.

I am curious, with the new Bioware failing to live up to old Bioware's pedigree for romance, what games would you say truly excel at delivering romance narratives. I know it's not for everyone, but I personally find that if executed well, a romance subplot can really help elevate a game, making it more memorable and enjoyable to play. 

It could be a game that excels in romancing companion characters, or even a linear, main story romance that is done well.",normal

"Games that punish death As I grow older, I¬¥ve been noticing what I have been craving in games lately and why I cant enjoy them like before. Earlier games, like NES games and older titles gave you some punishment for dying, some were preety hardcore I admit, but a game like Super Mario for example, you had a finite number of lifes so you had to be careful and there was always the thrill of messing up. In more recent titles we have the souls like formula that death is not a game over, but if you die you might loose your souls. There are more games that punish that to a degree, rouguelikes for example and another title like Blood West, which punish every death with a debuff. So anyway I noticed what I want now in games is that, games that actually punish death or a finite number of saves or lifes to prevent save scumming. Hardcore mode are still too much for me because you completely start over and thats not what im looking for. Im looking for games that allow for some mistakes and punish death with debuff, or xp or gold for example and give that thrill of if I mess up I m going to lose something.

"Does the Xbox core controller have stick drift problems?  So back in April I bought myself a dualsense to use on my docked steam deck. Fast forward to September, the left stick started drifting to the left. I sent it for a couple of days to repair it and turns out it wasn't because of small particles, it was actually damaged for some reason. But couple days ago now and the right stick started drifting to the left, and today was even worse than before.

For this reason I'm planning to get myself a new controller that (hopefully) I'm going to use for a while, mainly because if it took this little time for the sticks to get damaged, chances are it will happen again. So does the core controller have this issue, or any other problem I should be aware of? ",normal

This is nothing against low pitch voiced individuals but it's something i have noticed; in a lot of high fantasy video games if there is a voice acted protagonist and you play as a male, the voice is more often a lower pitched voice

I'm wondering if there is any kind of reasoning for that, does it have to do with how a person with a low voice is percived subcoinciously by people?

For example i have just started Dragon Age: The Veilguard and when choosing the voice for my protag i did choose the lowest voice option, it just seemed to 'fit' right and it got me wondering there are quite a few scenarios like that

Geralt in The Witcher being a prime example, even goes beyond high fantasy, Titus in the new Space Marines game is deeper voiced",normal

"I want to rekindle my love for gaming but I'm struggling When I was younger I loved playing games, I'm not OLD now but older. I enjoyed story games. I enjoyed playing them, I could sit for hours and play them. Now I start a story up, within 30 minutes I'm ready to quit. I hop between so many different games, usually multiplayer, trying to find something to stick. I don't really have an identity when it comes to gaming anymore. I just...don't enjoy anything.

2.) I played nearly all the one through Fallout: Tactics and loved it, despite the lack of story, but a bugged save game destroyed my progress in the final level and I just never went back.

3.) I did play Fallout: New Vegas, but in the very first big quest - hostage situation - I found a high entrance in the back of the building and snuck in. Then, when I cleared the building and came back out the front door, the quest was bugged. The people outside acted as if the quest hadn't started yet, and I lost hours of play. I got frustrated and wandered in to the wasteland, where my shotgun was totally useless against some dude in Roman armor with a stick.

I love the setting, I know the series is an important one to gaming and pop culture, so despite a long string of frustrating bugs and annoying gameplay, I want to give it another shot.

So, where do I start? Pick up Fallout/Fallout 2 on Steam and live in retro nostalgia? Suck it up and revisit New Vegas? Or get weird and try the Fallout 1 mod in Fallout 4?",normal

"Unpopular Opinion: I'm OK with PSN Requirements on PC Yes, I'm prepped to be downvoted to oblivion.

Everyone likes to blame Sony for some countries not having access to PSN. The blame resides completely on the country's governments. Said governments aren't allowing Playstation to operate in those countries, mainly due to infrastructure (mainly internet instability) or religious issues.

As for the countries that do have access, stop being so butthurt about the requirement on PC. Be happy we got Playstation games on PC in the first place. Every company collects your data in some form. The data collected is probably being used to see what people are playing and what their PC specs are for new ports to be better optimized. If my data is being collected to potentially bring more PS games (Last of Us Part 2, Original God of War Trilogy, Original Uncharted Trilogy, Original Ratchet and Clank Trilogy, Jak and Daxter Trilogy, etc.) to PC faster, then Sony can collect as much info of mine as they need.

"Why I Quit Playing PVP Games This post might just be me ranting out of frustration, but here‚Äôs my story.

First off, I‚Äôll admit it: I *~~‚Äôm not great~~*  suck at PVP games. I‚Äôve tried to get better, but I just don‚Äôt have the time or energy to keep up with the ‚Äúsweatfest‚Äù that online PVP games have become. If you want to compete, it feels like you have to focus exclusively on that one game, learning every update and mastering every new *~~meta~~* changes.

As a casual gamer (though my friends might say I play a lot, I‚Äôd call myself casual compared to what I see in the *~~PVP~~* gaming world), I just don‚Äôt have the time for the constant grind these games demand. PVP live-service games are always changing, and if I can‚Äôt stay sharp by investing time to learn the new stuff, I get *~~destroyed~~* beaten in matches without realising what happened. And let‚Äôs be real: getting *~~stomped over and over~~* defeated without knowing why isn‚Äôt fun.

Take *Hunt: Showdown*, for example. I love it‚Äîthe atmosphere, the graphics, the whole vibe. But the constant updates mean you‚Äôre always *~~relearning the game~~* learning new things if you take a break. After 500 hours of play, I stepped away for a bit, and when I came back, it felt like I‚Äôd lost *~~all~~* a lot my game sense, plus I needed to learn a bunch of new stuff. The thought *~~of relearning everything~~* getting used to it to the level I was plus a lot of new stuff just to have a chance at surviving and realising what happened in case I didn't felt exhausting.

It‚Äôs a pattern I‚Äôve seen in other PVP games. *League of Legends* was the first one where I realized I couldn‚Äôt keep up with the endless changes and *~~meta~~* shifts. Then it happened with *Overwatch*. Eventually, I uninstalled these games‚Äînot because they‚Äôre bad, but because I didn‚Äôt want to spend every moment of my free time on just one game, just to keep up and with the thought ""I have to keep playing in order to be able to read what's happening so I adjust my playing accordingly"". Losing is fine, but when I don‚Äôt even understand why I‚Äôm losing, it‚Äôs a whole different level of frustration. The same goes to wining. That's fine too, but if I do not understand why am I wining, what am I learning?

So now I‚Äôm more into PVE games like *Deep Rock Galactic*, *Vermintide 2*, *Darktide*, and *Witchfire*. Sure, these games get updates too, but they‚Äôre not as critical to enjoying the game. There‚Äôs a predictability in PVE‚Äîif I lose, I know what went wrong. With PVP, it feels like there are endless variables (looking at you, *Deadlock*) and way too much to master just to keep up with the basics. Unless you‚Äôre playing constantly, it‚Äôs almost impossible to keep up with the *~~meta~~* changes, so PVP feels less and less accessible for anyone with work, family, or just other things going on in life.

So what about you? Have you given up on PVP games? If so, why?

  
\-- edit --

I realize I may have been unclear before, giving readers the impression that they‚Äôd reach a conclusion on the ""keeping up with changes"" issue. Let me clarify what I meant:

Imagine you‚Äôre a chess player who has spent a thousand hours learning and playing chess. You participate in matches based on your MMR, and you probably win or lose around 50% of the time ‚Äî a standard 50/50 ratio. By focusing solely on chess, you're at the peak of your current knowledge and skill. With hundreds of games under your belt, you understand where you made mistakes and where you made good choices. Each win and loss teaches you something ‚Äî about your own moves, and why your opponent did what they did. I‚Äôve always enjoyed good sportsmanship, shaking hands with opponents who might be vastly better (and not toxic, but that's another topic). I even cheer for them when they beat me because I love learning, *if* ‚Äî and this is a big ""if"" ‚Äî I understand what actually happened in the game.

Now, let‚Äôs say you start to enjoy card games. There‚Äôs an element of luck and randomness in them that appeals to you. You decide to split your focus: 60% on chess, 40% on card games. That‚Äôs fine because chess hasn‚Äôt had a content update in decades. There haven‚Äôt been any map changes, no new pieces, no moves removed or adjusted. There‚Äôs no progression system being pushed with ""FOMO"" tactics like some companies use in modern games. Nothing has changed, so when you return to chess, you‚Äôre roughly where you left off ‚Äî maybe a little rusty, but still at a solid skill level because you‚Äôre only devoting part of your free time to it while also enjoying card games.

But now, let‚Äôs imagine patches or updates are added to the chess game. Not only does it have a lot of complex variables, but these keep changing, sometimes in small ways and sometimes in major ways. Now, after a break, you have to retrain yourself *and* learn new strategies. Otherwise, you‚Äôll learn nothing from a match with someone who has kept up with the changes. Yes, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôll rank lower and move into a tier that‚Äôs more appropriate, which is actually fine. Matching with players at an equal level makes for fairer games, right? In an ideal world, yes, but that‚Äôs another topic. Let‚Äôs say you lose one match and win another, learning a bit each time and eventually ranking up again.

Then another patch drops in the card game. The usual learning process restarts. You realize that this is going to demand even more time ‚Äî you know your limits, and it‚Äôs going to take more focus to adapt. Now you face a decision: Do you cut back on chess sessions? Do you reduce your card game time? Do you quit one altogether? Do you go to the extreme ‚Äî divorce your wife, move into a one-room apartment, buy a gaming chair, and live off smoothies just to keep up with these constant changes? Or do you quit this endless cycle entirely?

I hope this explanation is clearer. I‚Äôve tried to make my point as well as I could, with some help, of course.",normal

Apparently at some point they reorganized their store and moved over to new software or something, and sent out a mass email to customers saying ""you have to migrate your account over to the new system within a certain time period, if you don't your content will be lost"" and I missed it.

"I feel as though both traditional sci fi and fantasy gaming have shifted their priorities and image in the last 15-20 years https://preview.redd.it/np8i1r8ozeyd1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b7f8852ad79b78a231bd0567b9a88f10f950c34

Mid 2000‚Äôs, the biggest traditional fantasy franchises was stuff like Fable, Zelda, WOW, Final Fantasy, Runescape, Prince of Persia, and Kingdom hearts. Mostly family friendly, very colorful, and generally cheery. You had some dark fantasy franchises like Legacy of Kain, God of War, Thief, Neverwinter Nights, and Baldurs Gate but these were outnumbered and many weren‚Äôt as big. While Oblivion was M rated, it had a very oversaturated, colorful, and fairly cheery atmosphere for Elder Scrolls. When one of your darker looking fantasy franchises are licensed LOTR games, you‚Äôre not that dark.

During that same stretch, the biggest sci fi franchises had darker and grittier tones, content, and art styles. Stuff like Halo, Metroid Prime, Unreal, Quake, Half Life, StarCraft, and Doom. There were also games like Deus Ex and Dawn of War. Star Wars games back then like Battlefront, Republic Commando, and KOTOR 1-2 had a much darker tone than they do today. Later on we would have Gears of War, Mass Effect, and Dead Space. All darker franchises.

Then the pendulum started to turn around 2009-2014 and has been ballooning ever since. 

Dark fantasy games in Dragon Age origins and Demon‚Äôs Souls released in 2009. Elder Scrolls in 2011 shifted more towards a darker aesthetic with Skyrim. Dark Souls also released in 2011 and the Witcher series became more well known in 2011 with Witcher 2. Shadow of Mordor and later War both took an even darker LOTR approach. Total War Warhammer 1-3 took over the RTS genre. Witcher 3 blew up in 2015. Fromsoft made 5 more dark fantasy soulslikes that inspired dozens of other dark fantasy soulslikes like Nioh 1-2. Dishonored 1-2 released. Diablo popped up again after a decade long hiatus. God of War got rebooted after being away for awhile. Baldurs Gate 3 blew up and helped made dark fantasy CRPGs big again. Hellblade and Warhammer Vermintide popped up. Final Fantasy 16 went for a grittier medieval bit. There‚Äôs still more family friendly stuff like Zelda and Monster Hunter but the genre is now dark fantasy dominant. Also I wouldn't call DOTA and League of Legends family friendly but they are a bit tamer. 

As for Sci Fi, most of the previous franchises I mentioned are either dormant, dead, or past their prime. Halo and StarCraft aren‚Äôt as big. Dead space (besides a remake), Half Life, Command and Conquer, Unreal, Quake, Deus Ex, and Dawn of War are all dead, dormant, or dying. Star Wars, even in regard to its darkest moments, is still much more family friendly than it was before. Darker Titanfall got turned into a more kid friendly sport atmosphere with Apex Legends. Doom is at least still kicking and Metroid has returned recently after being away for a while.

There‚Äôs occasional exceptions like alien isolation, Space marine 2, Prey, Cyberpunk, Helldivers, and Armored Core 6 but these come in the form of individual games, not big franchises putting out new entries in gradual succession. It had originally been decades since the last Space Marine and Armored Core game. Helldivers 2 is a whole different genre from tiny Helldivers 1. Alien Isolation was from ten years ago and only just now got a sequel announced. Cyberpunk and Prey are both standalone so far. Starfield is standalone and rated M but it‚Äôs not nearly as gritty as Skyrim or Fallout. So you don't have many darker franchises being established that can put out sequels and keep momentum going like they used to. It might be two decades before we get another Starfield. 

The biggest sci fi games today are online free-to-play games that never really go beyond blood and violence. Apex, once human, Destiny, Warframe, Overwatch, Ark. There‚Äôs also a lot of family friendly sci fi sandbox games like No Man‚Äôs Sky and elite dangerous.

I don't necessarily know how to feel about this shift but I will say that when I was a kid in the mid 2000's, I hated fantasy and loved sci fi. As an adult however, I find myself preferring current fantasy over sci fi nowadays. ",normal
"I'm enjoying Veilguard, it's actually kind of awesome. This isn't a review necessarily, or meant to dismiss the entirely fair criticisms of the game, or even denounce the entirely UN-fair criticisms of the game. I just wanted to say I'm having a great time with it.

The animations are gorgeous, the set pieces are well done, the voice acting is solid. Little too early to comment on the story for me, but I went in expecting some high fantasy with some dark undertones and so far that's what I'm getting (each game since Origins has gotten a little less dark in tone, so not surprised there). Sure, it's a departure from previous titles, but then so were each of the sequels a departure from their predecessors. It's okay not to like the direction a series takes, I personally don't mind it.

But as 30+ gamer who's favorite title in the series is DA:Origins by a landslide, I can honestly say I'm having a great time, enjoying the story, the characters, the gameplay, I don't feel like I'm being preached at, I don't feel like my hand is being held by any of the systems. It's not going to be in my top 3 games of all time or anything, but it's a good time.

If I had to nitpick, I guess I miss the open world, but then I also complained that Inquisition's open world felt too empty, so, win some lose some. I don't even really mind the little popups that tell you the results of decisions like ""oh, you did this thing so Varrik now feels this way."" Sure it's a little upfront, but it feels reminiscent of TellTale games - ""Varrik will remember this."" I don't NEED the game to tell me how Varrik feels or how so-and-so was injured as a result of my actions, but I don't feel like my intelligence is being insulted either. 

**tl;dr** \- Not a perfect game, but I'm having a great time, steam lets you refund within 2 hours, give it a shot if the reviews have left you on the fence. I'm in the demographic of the majority of negative reviews (little older gamer, fan of Origins, miss the ""old"" bioware, etc) and I'm enjoying it just fine. ",normal

I loved the Bethesda games, but the maps get smaller over the years.  I would love to see a game where you could travel around to different areas, find snow, mountains, tropical areas, everything. But you shouldn't be able to walk from one to another in a day. If they can generate the world of No Man's Sky, could a dev not make a game where one world is generated?

"I am so sick of GRUNTING in combat audio in GoW (and the like) Why the hell is that type of audio (think Kratos grunting with every punch) not its own volume slider and is instead included under the dialogue slider? 

I‚Äôm playing through Shadow of War right now and it is infuriating that I can‚Äôt hear what Talion and Celibrimbor are saying to one another in the open world without getting deafened by the sound of orcs grunting and squealing when I enter combat. Or when I find one of the artifacts and there‚Äôs an audio line about it. There aren‚Äôt subtitles for either of those types of dialogues, only for the cutscenes themselves. So if I want to hear what is being said in those world-building moments I have to have the volume up way louder than I want during combat. 

The sound effect slider adjusts the volume of you actually fighting (swords clashing, explosions, etc.) but doesn‚Äôt impact the sound of Talion/orcs grunting. That‚Äôs controlled by the dialogue slider. 

And I know that isn‚Äôt the only game like this. Same thing in GoW - I have to hear Kratos grunting and screaming ‚ÄúBoy‚Äù at ridiculous volumes during fights if I want a chance of hearing Mimir‚Äôs story in the boat a few minutes later. It‚Äôs better in GoW than Shadow of War because you do have the option to have subtitles during Mimir‚Äôs stories and such, but they still group the custom audio options together in the same way.

Am I the only one who wants the ability to turn down ALL of the in-combat audio, including the voice-acted portions (grunting, characters shouting to one another, death moans of your enemies, etc.) without impacting the dialogue audio outside of combat? Trying to play some of these games if you live with people who go to bed before you do is an absolute nightmare!

You can access TS2's story mode totally legitimately through Homefront via the button code, OR you can download a player-made mod called ‚ÄúTime Splitters 2 Redux‚Äù that upgrades TS2 a bit, and give it its very own launcher so you can launch directly into it and play it as a straight-up PC port with native keyboard and mouse and up-res textures.

You need to own a copy of Homefront: The Revolution, which as mentioned, is currently on sale on Steam for $3.

By the way, you'll need to launch Homefront at least once to write the game.cfg file which you'll need to use to edit settings like mouse sensitivity, which TS2 will reference (the in-game control settings don't have mouse and keyboard options). There are also custom configs out there you can copy and paste to tweak the game to its best settings. 

It plays a little janky but it's not bad. 

To be utterly clear, this is fully legal, because full access to TS2 IS BUILT INTO HOMEFRONT, this isn't emulation or anything of the like. The mod you download only lets you launch straight into it rather than requiring you to launch Homefront first.

* *Dynasty Warriors Series* \- Love the concept of musou games, I just wish there were more of them. DW games are kind of old for my taste (except for 9, which I've heard is awful), and the only other one I know of is *Hyrule Warriors,* which I don't have the console for.
* *Orcs Must Die* \- Playing OMD3 is actually what's making me interested in finding games like this. It was fun to feel overpowered as I mowed down tons of baddies.
* *Vampire Survivors* \- I'm not too interested in top-down games or roguelikes without a plot, but I might try it.
* *They Are Billions* \- Not too interested in base-builders, but I *might* try it.

Anything else out there? Thanks!

I've read people saying that they're going to steal (because really, that's what it really is) games because they're too expensive or the company is asking too much for a PC port (this is what triggered me, reading comments about the RDR port). Do people really not understand that they are trying to justify their behavior?

If you don't want to support a company, just don't buy their product. That doesn't equate to being justified to become a thief. ""Oh, I steal things all of the time"" isn't something that people should be able to honestly state, much less something that they should be PROUD of.

"Subverting tropes and conventions in memorable ways. What are some games that subverted the common tropes or conventions of their genre in memorable ways? Were they satisfying or cheap? 

(Of course, spoilers will follow)

One notable example is *Deus Ex: Mankind Divided* with the ""take your time"" trope. At the start of the game, you  enter your company's building and your boss yells at you over the intercom to come and meet him ASAP to resolve some terrorist situation. Of course, you want to explore the building, and you know that games only progress when the player does something important, so you take your time exploring all the nooks and crannies, even as your boss keeps yelling at you. Except that... you took too long faffing around and now the hostages are dead. Yikes. If found this one effective and a very clear message that this game took realism seriously. And it prepares you for later missions where time really is important. 

Compare this to something like Fable 3, where each time you progress to the next stage, it skips a reasonable amount of days, making the player feel like they still have time to save up enough money to save the kingdom. Aaaaand then there's a completely unexpected and massive 121 days right to the final battle, leaving many players completely unprepared and the kingdom suffering. And there's only 1 auto-save file, so no way to reload and fix your mistake. This one was *NOT* appreciated, as it was far too late and important to mess with people's expectations like that. 

These were about ""take your time"", but what about other tropes or conventions? What are some times where you went ""huh, that isn't how it normally goes""?

I might be in the minority here, but I personally prefer partially voice acted dialogue over fully voiced one.

And this leads me to the beef of it: What costs an arm and a leg in game development? Voice acting. What is the first thing players usually skip in repeated playthroughs? Dialogue. Put two and two together and you have a triple A requirement that:

A) really only shines on the first playthrough

B) takes a whole lot of money and time to implement

C) makes it harder for modders to add content (+ NPCs) to the game which doesn't stick out like a sore thumb

D) at worst detracts the whole experience (which in turn leads to more dialogue skipping),

I fully admit I couldn't imagine Mass Effect 1 - 3 without full voice acting (could have done without characters like Diana Allers & Kai Leng on the whole, but I digress), but on the other side of the coin KOTOR 1 - 2 got around of it in a clever manner: Human characters were VA'd as you'd expect (by a handful of VAs like Bethesda), but the aliens only muttered couple repeated voice clips while dialogue text displayed what they actually said. I wish more games did the latter, figured out some lore reasons (""Only your main char speaks X language"" or something) and spent their budgets on things like playtesting or the writing itself.

I'd gladly hear differing thoughts and examples of phenomenal voice acting! I've heard praises of God of War's Red Dead Redemption's voice acting and I've sat through couple non-commented horror game Let's Plays with great voice acting.

How many of you are bothered by partial voice acting over full voice acting? Genuinely curious.",normal

"Is There a Term for Assassin's Creed / Shadow of Mordor Style Games? I recently picked up Mad Max on steam for a whim since it was 3 bucks and it uses the same gameplay style as the original Assassin Creed games and the two Shadow of Mordor games. Beat-em-up game with a parry prompt, and an open world you unlock as you explore. I really enjoy this style and wanted to find some others, but I don't know if there's a term I could search for.

"Interesting ways games have blended singleplayer and multiplayer?  While I wouldn't call it a subgenre by any means, I have had a small, but strong fascination with games and mechanics that blend singleplayer and multiplayer in novel ways. If you don't mind sharing, what are some interesting ways you have seen this achieved?

I'm personally aware of:

Death Stranding ‚Äì Singleplayer game. While you don't get to meet other players, you do run into things left behind by them. Signs, infrastructure, lost or donated gear and materials, cargo that needed to go in a different direction than they were travelling, and so on. You can go out of your way to help yourself and others, or leave ""likes"" on things that you have found useful. There's even more, as this kind of stuff is one of the game's defining features.

Nier: Automata ‚Äì Singleplayer game, you can find corpses of other players around the areas they died in and either reclaim them for some goods, or quickly fix them up to have them temporarily fight alongside you. There are death messages you can put together from a set list of options, and have them display when your corpse is found. >!Also, during the game's finale.!<

Journey ‚Äì >!While it feels very much like a singleplayer exploration/walking/environmental narrative game and can be played so, you quickly discover you can run into a different player and join them for a leg of the journey. Also, the game features a trove of secrets and hidden mechanics, which you can be taught and in turn teach others.!<

No Man's Sky ‚Äì Not sure if worth listing, but the separation of singleplayer and multiplayer is very loose, and thus interesting. Without directly joining a session with another player or teleporting directly to someone else's publicly listed base (both features added later, I believe), the game very much feels and plays like a singleplayer experience, with you in a vast, vast ocean of stars. That said, you can run into things discovered, named or built by other players, and I do believe it is possible to see someone else in real time should you be lucky enough to be in the same place at the same time. >!The only two exceptions are glyphs, which you can either slowly collect sandbox-style or get from the main storyline, and which allow you to use the game's older teleporters and manual adresses, and the Anomaly station, which you can summon anywhere after you unlock it, and where you can meet and team up with strangers at any time, even if you've come from and will return to different points in the universe.!<

"PC gamer looking for new recommendations. HELP As the title says I‚Äôm looking for something new to play. I‚Äôm tired of online multiplayer gaming but not completely opposed to it. I grew up on Nintendo so I‚Äôd say I have more of an affinity to story driven single player games. 

It doesn‚Äôt have to be brand new, I don‚Äôt mind if it‚Äôs an older title. I also would prefer something that‚Äôs not full price considering how crazy it‚Äôs gotten. 

Some of my favourite titles of all time are things like
Batman Arkham City, Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, Red Dead Redemption 2, marvel‚Äôs Spider-Man. The game doesn‚Äôt need to be these styles either, recently played some of the wolfenstein franchise so I‚Äôm open to shooters as well.

I was wondering if there was a box of some sort that had a heating element to it that I could put my hands into to quickly warm them up. I'm thinking like one of those air dryers they have to dry your hands in the bathroom but it just throws heat instead.

Edit 2: Thank you so very much for the support that this post has received, it really has been quite overwhelming. This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.

All I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.

"Youtuber ""Potates"" completely plagiarized a post I made on r/Fallout about Fallout 76, and passed it off as his own work. The video is now at 800k views. EDIT 5: Just wanted to thank everybody for their interest in this topic and in me as a content creator. Now that things are cooling off, I will make an update thread a few days from now to let everybody know how things have turned out. 

There are also hundreds of people encouraging me to make a YouTube channel and I just wanted to acknowledge that. I really appreciate your interest and may set something up, but I don't have anything at this moment to share.

Thanks everybody for their kind words and support. :)

I'm not sure why this thread was locked, I didn't get a message from the mods about it. I assume just because the thread has run its course, and I'm okay with that.

**EDIT 2:**

I had no idea that this thread would blow up in the way that it has -- I only posted here to begin with because a buddy of mine posts here and he said it would be good to share, and maybe get some exposure for the original post. I am pretty overwhelmed with the amount of people who are taking an interest in this and I want to make it abundantly clear that I do not and will not ever support anybody who is dishing out threats and personal attacks against Potates. Be better than that. Thanks.

Potates has DM'd be acknowledging the situation and owning up to it, and does not deserve to be harassed and threatened over this. He has been cool about the whole situation and I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, and be cool back. Neither he nor I knew just how crazy this situation was going to get. Again, I am asking you from the bottom of my heart, do not lash out at Potates. Do not harass him, do not harass his family. These actions are 100% wrong and I condemn them wholeheartedly. Calling him out for his behavior is one thing, but when you cross the line into his real life, you have gone too far and need to reexamine your moral compass.

**EDIT 4:**

I am aware that Potates has removed all his videos except for his apology. I am not responsible for this, and I have not filed any kind of DMCA claim against him as we are settling things privately. I have and will continue to encourage him to not delete his YouTube channel, as I believe he can and will bounce back from this controversy. Plagiarism is serious, and there is a lesson here to be learned -- if he respects the content of *all* creators moving forward, then his channel can become a positive part of YouTube again.

It is easy to be angry at this situation, believe me. But I am always willing to give somebody another chance if they are prepared to make a genuine change, and for now, I am willing to give that chance and let things play out.

-------------------

Link to the Potates video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t26s5aMSBWY

Link to my post, which he reads (mostly) verbatim off in his video without any credit to me, or even that it is a post from reddit, whatsoever: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/8qsx8s/complete_notes_from_the_noclip_documentary/

\^That's a massive Fallout 76 info dump based on the Noclip documentary that had a strong community reaction, and got passed around a lot. It took me a while to write up as I watched the documentary, and I spent a non-trivial amount of time making as it clear and concise as possible, using direct quotes whenever possible. Shout out to when he misread one of my points that said camps are saved as blueprints, and accidentally said ""served as blueprints"" which is a nonsensical statement.

I'm passionate about video games, and love to write about them, even though I'm not a professional. So to see something you've written being plagiarized after putting in time and effort to share that written content with people just hurts a little bit. When you're looking for more opportunities to write in a way that will attract attention, seeing somebody else take that attention can really suck.

He starts his video off at the ""Gameplay"" section of my post, and at the beginning switches up his verbiage a little bit so it's not too obvious. As the video goes on, that stops quickly, and he starts reading every single bullet point almost verbatim. I'm not *too* upset because I'm glad more people got to see the information, but I am a little irritated that he passes it off as his own work. He reads the post like it was his script! Even the way he does the voice over makes it sound as if he is saying these things off the cuff, when in reality he is reading off the words I wrote from a page.  I only found this video at all because I clicked it and wanted to hear new Fallout 76 information -- a minute or two in, I realized that I had heard those words before... because I wrote them!

Here's the thing. If he had shot me a message saying ""hey man, I'd like to quote this post in a video"", I'd have said go for it 100%. If at the beginning of the video he had said something like ""hey guys I found this post on reddit I'd like to read you"", I'd be fine with that. But the fact that he passes this off as if he wrote it all, or as if he took the time to compile this information is definitely frustrating to me. I feel like I put in the work for this, and then this guy turned around and monetized it without even having the decency to acknowledge that it wasn't his. 




EDIT: I see a lot of you commenting on the video saying that he has stolen my content. Unfortunately, it appears as if he is deleting all of those comments as they come in.

---------------


**EDIT 3:***

~~I tried to comment on Potates' apology video, but the comments aren't going through. Here is what I wrote, if I am able to post it directly on the video I will do so in the morning.~~ **EDIT 5:** It appears as if the apology video has been deleted.

> Hey, I'm _Robbie. First off, I would like to lead with the fact that I completely condemn anybody who is issuing any kind of threats to @Potates and his family. Nobody deserves to be threatened and harassed over a situation like this. 

> Secondly, I would encourage @Potates not to delete his YouTube channel. I do not agree that there is no coming back from this. Mistakes were made, feathers were ruffled, and lessons were learned. I have seen smaller YouTube channels come back from worse. I have given Potates full permission to re-post the offending video under the agreement that I am properly credited, and that we can work out our differences in private. I truly believe in the value of giving somebody another chance, and even in spite of everything, I am willing to give Potates another chance.

> This whole situation got out of hand to a degree that nobody could have predicted.  Me and Potates are making things right between us in private as I type this and I am confident that we will come to an understanding.

"A message to those calling EA for a refund: be nice to the people taking your calls. Let's face it, this debacle with EA is terrible.  It's shady.  It is, according to the internet, worth hundreds of thousands of downvotes.  And now, on top of everything, if you want to remedy the situation you are forced to sit in an exaggerated phone line.

But keep in mind, the people taking your call at EA are having a much worse day than you!  These people are not the CEO, they're not the game designers, and they may not even be located in the same building as these people.  They are just trying to do their job, and it just so happens that they work at a company currently undergoing a pseudo scandal.

So be kind to them.  Because at the end of the day, they probably hate EA right now too.


Edit 1: Thank you, kind Redditor, for the Gold!  And thank you to the community for supporting the idea of showing kindness to others!

Edit 2: Thank you to the other four Gold-givers as well!  We almost hit #1 on the front page, but I think we topped out at #2.  I'm happy to see that a positive post was able to reach so high in the midst of this event!

Edit 3: I'd like to extend (likely) one last thank you to the Redditor who awarded this post its sixth gold, and to the community that actually took this post to #1 on the main page.  The Reddit community never ceases to amaze me, and I'm glad everyone could agree to support the idea of promoting human kindness.  Thanks everyone!",normal

"Just re-watched The Batman (2022) It was even better the second time around!

Gotham is just soooooo grimey and corrupt. It's such a lived in city, with such a last days of the Roman empire vibes.

I think what stood out the second time of viewing is just how much Bruce Wayne/Batman has dis-associated from society and although so succinct in his mission of ""cleaning up Gotham"", he is still searching for a purposeful way of doing it.

I think a legitimate critism of Batman is that he is an ultra rich man with a lot of soft power in gotham, so it's weird that he only goes after low level criminals and doesn't fix the larger issues plaguing Gotham. This movie definitely fixes that by bridging the connection between both blue and white collar crimes, but it also fleshes out how Batman (in the 2nd year of being Batman) is still trying to figure out the best way to fix the city, it even shows him realising his approach is flawed.

The batmobile car chase is absolutely amazing. From the point of the engine revving up and the reaction of the penguin and his goons realising it's the Batman their up against literally gives me goosebumps everytime I see it.

What is everyone else's thoughts on their second viewing of this movie?",normal
"The Big Short - can anyone explain how Ryan Gosling‚Äôs  character made money? So I love this movie. I watch it all the time.

But I could never figure out how/why Ryan Gosling‚Äôs character was convincing Mark Baum to buy the swaps.

My understanding of swaps is (in a gross oversimplification) that it‚Äôs sort of like options in that if the event occurs the buyer of the swap makes money while the seller of the swap loses money. But if it doesn‚Äôt happen then the buyer loses the cost of the swap (though more complicated because the buyer could have to pay more throughout the time).


So why was Ryan so hell bent on selling the swaps and then why did he make a fat check at the end?  What was his characters position? What happened if mark didn‚Äôt buy the swaps from him?


I hope this doesn‚Äôt break rule 12.

Edit: woah stayed off reddit for a whole two hours and came back to finally getting my answer.  He had too many swaps and was selling some to offset the risk and possible illiquidity. 

For those still confused I didn‚Äôt see a comment that said this so hopefully this helps:  Burry throughout the process kept changing the white board to reflect the decreasing value of his fund as he way paying off the premiums from the increased price (or value) of the MBS/CDOs. Investors panicked and tried pulling out (which burry stopped). Jared (Gosling) had the same problem but couldn‚Äôt keep his bosses from pulling the plug so he had to sell some of his swaps to Baum to limit his risk (and decrease the monthly premiums)",normal

"What fictional character do you think experienced the worst character assasination when being adapted for film? Basically, who was a great fully dimensional character in the book and then got adapted into something terrible?
This could be from a good or bad adaptation, it doesn't matter. I'll throw my hat in the ring first:

Mike Hanlon from IT.

Mike in the book is the only black kid in all of Derry, but he has a warm and idyllic homelife that balances it all out. He's smart and researches history in his free time, he loves his daddy with all his heart and he loves his friends even more. As an adult he's very lonely but he still remains very hopeful that one day IT will meet its demise. When Henry Bowers, his racist childhood bully meets him again in the library with a knife, Mike still has the empathy to understand Henry is mentally ill and being used as a puppet. He tries to talk to him and call the police so he can safely be returned back to the mental hospital but it obviously goes south.

In the it 2016 continuity Mike is none of those things.
Mike is legitimately a crazy person in IT chapter 2, and the film makers replaced his lovely childhood with his parents with sheep murder and fire and guns. His historian stuff is given to Ben for literally no reason, in it chapter 2 he lies to his friends repeatedly and even DRUGS BILL. He also steals native american artifacts when he probably could have to told the tribe ""hey man I know it didn't work the first time ya'll tried it but can I try it again? I have literally nothing to lose."". His confrontation with Henry in the library just culminates in him beating the crap out of him and almost dying, nothing to humanize Henry or show Mike's empathy. He doesn't even really get to do anything while everyone else goes on stupid little spirit journeys. 

Honorable mention to Stanley too, who in the book saves the losers lives at times, has a silly but strange sense of humor, and kills himself because he genuinely is so terrified of IT, movie stanley spends the whole movie bitching and complaining about everything, kills himself for ""the good of the group"", and is even describe by Richie as ""the weakest of us"". Booooo. 

I'm not gonna sit here and say everything in the IT book is fantastic, or that stephen king is fantastic at writing black characters (even stephen king admits his pitfalls there) but jesus god! This is all made even worse by the fact when the muschiettis were developing it they considered making Mike a crack addict as adult. They later go some serious and well deserved backlash for that.

So anyways, who do you think got character assinated in an adaptation?",normal
"I genuinely enjoyed Trap (2024) I decided to watch M. Night Shyamalan‚Äôs newest film, Trap, last night. Prior to watching the movie I was unaware of the plot or premise and the only info I knew was that it was M. Night‚Äôs newest film. His movies have always been hit or miss for me but I figured I‚Äôd go in with an open mind and give it a fair shake. I will try to be as spoiler free as possible while describing my thoughts on the film. 

The first act had some great suspense building as the main character begins to realize just what he is in for. Josh Hartnett was phenomenal as he balanced two different characters, one of which only the audience is aware of, through the first and second act. Shots of Hartnett that framed his face from forehead to chin was a great way to show his superb facial expressions while acting this complex character (can someone say smiling eyes). 

The premise was unique, although a little similar to classic law enforcement/criminal cat and mouse type stuff. It wasn‚Äôt overly unrealistic or fantastical and felt at least possible if not probable throughout the film (maybe except the ending). 

The third act was the weakest point of the film from a plot perspective, which has been typical for M. Night films (at least IMO) for the last decade at least. The acting on the other hand was turned up a few notches towards the end and I was loving it. The pop star wasn‚Äôt as bad of an actor as people are making her out to be and I thought she carried the emotional weight (along with Hartnett‚Äôs family) of the climax very well. 

The ending was okay, I‚Äôll admit. A little over the top and the realism for sure dropped off right before the credits, but overall I enjoyed the suspense, the premise, the acting, and the culmination. I‚Äôve read a lot of hate on this film and I think much of it is unwarranted. Curious to hear anyone else‚Äôs thoughts. ",normal

"What are your biggest ‚ÄúNah, that's bullshit, I don't buy it‚Äù statements from actors and filmmakers? You probably know the feeling when you hear statements from actors and roll your eyes thinking ‚ÄúNo way I'm buying this bullshit.‚Äù

Example, (Please don't turn this into a debate about vaccinations.): But when Ice Cube told Tucker Carlson that he voluntarily turned down a $9 million fee for a movie that supposedly required vaccination for filming, but he declined and said ""your health is worth more than all the money in the world"", I personally thought that was bullshit for a number of reasons. Ice Cube would never get a 9 million dollar fee for a low budget comedy. That would be four times what Keanu Reeves received for the third John Wick. Maybe with a producer's fee, but as a producer he could have averted mandatory vaccination. He could have simply worn a mask during filming, like Tom Cruise in ‚ÄúMission: Impossible‚Äù, who didn't get vaccinated but wore a mask all the time, even as the lead actor and producer. So I rather think that there were other production struggles and Cube simply cited this as a reason to present it as a courageous and bold decision that he even gave up millions ""just for his conviction. We all would've taken the huge amount of money, but not him, what a legend"". The fact that he proudly tells Tucker Carlson of all people contributes to this.

Do you have any similar statements from actors/actresses and filmmakers that tickle your ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù radar?

"Movie details you like to share: Here's mine. In Truman Show and the trees in the forest are not as messy as real forests. They appear to be planted in rows, as one would expect from an artificial world. The Truman Show is a good movie but what elevates it at times to greatness is the little details that you may not notice the first time you watch the movie. 

For instance, when he is trying to escape through the forest, something doesn't seem quite right. The trees are planted in a row. It happens about 50 minutes or so into the movie. 

Another detail is the vitamin D he is taking. This was mentioned by a friend who said this must be because the world he lives in is not real so he will need vitamin D. But I countered that many people take vitamin D even in our world so I'm not sure how telling of a detail that one is.

"Favorite movie by european country: France Hello there,

or: my dear god - that was exciting! Often, I'm able to move on to the next country on my filmic journey a bit earlier than after 24 hours, but this time: No chance. *Rare Exports* had a thrilling battle with the winner until the very end and I thought I would have to roll the dice, but in the end, the mixture of upvotes and downvotes produced a different winner: ***Mies vailla menneisyytt√§*** (engl: *The Man Without a Past*) has narrowly become the most favorite movie set in Finland according to your votes.

I would have liked it for both of them: The runner-up scored with the Christmas theme, the winner seems to have been made by *the* Finnish director. In fact, I haven't seen either of them and maybe both will end up on my watchlist. If I'm completely honest, I haven't watched any of the films that won here yet. Maybe that will change today, because when it comes to your favorite movie set in **France**, I somehow have another one in mind that could win the contest. As everytime, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes). For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

"Film-productions that had an unintended but negative real-life outcome. Stretching a 300-page kids' book into a ten hour epic was never going end well artistically. **The Hobbit ""trilogy""** is the misbegotten followup to the classic Lord of the Rings films. Worse than the excessive padding, reliance on original characters, and poor special-effects, is what the production wrought on the New Zealand film industry. Warner Bros. wanted to move filming to someplace cheap like Romania, while Peter Jackson had the clout to keep it in NZ if he directed the project. The concession was made to simply destroy NZ's film industry by signing in a law that designates production-staff as contractors instead of employees, and with no bargaining power. Since then, elves have not been welcome in Wellington. [The whole affair is best recounted by Lindsay Ellis' excellent video essay.](https://youtu.be/uTRUQ-RKfUs)

[Danny Boyle's The Beach is the worst film ever made. ](https://youtu.be/rMHINpgFO3I)Looking back It's a fascinating time capsule of the late 90's/Y2K era. You've got Moby and All Saints on the soundtrack, internet cafes full of those bubble-shaped Macs before the rebrand, and nobody has a mobile phone. The story is about a backpacker played by Ewan, uh, Leonardo DiCaprio who joins a tribe of westerners that all hang on a cool beach on an uninhabited island off Thailand. It's paradise at first, but eventually reality will come crashing down and the secret of the cool beach will be exposed to the world. Which is what happened in real-life. The production of the film tampered with the real Ko Phi Phi Le beach to make it more paradise-like, prompting a lawsuit that dragged on over a decade. The legacy of the film pushed tourists into visiting the beach, eventually rendering it yet another cesspool until the Thailand authorities closed it in 2018. It's open today, but visits are short and strictly regulated.

Of course, there's also the old favorite that is **The Conqueror**. Casting the white cowboy John Wayne as the Mongolian warlord Genghis Khan was laughed at even in the day. What's less funny is that filming took place downwind from a nuclear test site. 90 crew members developed cancer and half of them died as a result, John Wayne among them. This was of course exacerbated by how smoking was more commonplace at the time.

"Ideas for Unhinged Double Features.  Me and a friend have gotten an opportunity to put together a weekly double feature night at a local independent theatre. Our idea is to pick movies that are wildly different in tone, genre or style but when placed next to each other recontexualize each other in interesting ways. The idea came to me last year after watching the new version of ""All's Quiet On The Western Front"" I was feeling a bit heavy after and kind of randomly put on James Gunns ""The Suicide Squad"". It was a movie that I'd seen before and knew I liked and I didn't really think about it, just figured it would like cheer me up or cool me off or whatever but the tonal switch from death at war as dramatic horror to death at war as goofy comedy was actually horrific. The whole first action scene was a completely different shocking experience which I found really interesting. 

So anyways, we've got a few ideas but I would love to hear some other opinions. Obviously one movie playing something for horror and another playing it for comedy is a reliable blueprint but I'm open to any ideas. 

So if you were tasked with picking two very different movies that best recontexualized each other in interesting ways what would you pick? ",normal

"Questions about the ending of Heretic Okay, so I just watched Heretic, and all I can say is wow! It kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole two hours, and I walked out of the theater unable to fully put together all of my thoughts. I have a lot of questions about some of the details included at the end of the movie that I could find from other posts/sources that I will obscure under spoiler text. 

>!What was the purpose of the different rooms down on the cellar depicting different religious/ antireligious icons?!<

>!What was the purpose of making the final room cold and moist? Was it just to make the women in cages suffer?!<

>!Were the people in cages other missionaries who passed by before? If not what are their origins?!<

>!Is the butterfly landing on Paxton's hand at the very end symbolic of her dying? Or that Barnes is communicating with her from the other side?!<

"Evil Dead - Balancing Horror & Comedy I'm curious how people feel about comedy in their horror films. I disliked the Evil Dead franchise for a long time because I'm one of those people who just doesn't like comedy in my horror movies. I feel like humor takes you out of what is supposed to be a moment of genuine fear and horror. Horror and Comedy to me are polar opposites, we turn to comedy when we want to escape from horrors.

The camp of the Bruce Campbell films maybe work in large part because of his charisma on screen which I like but even that has never been enough for me to enjoy them. Then I watched Evil Dead 2013 and I absolutely loved that movie. It has humor...but it's dark humor. I immediately felt a similarity to The Exorcist where some of the writing that made people uncomfortable in that film, I just found to be funny. Specifically the possession parts of it and it was the same in Evil Dead 2013. The Devil has a sick sense of humor but it's what I would expect the embodiment of evil to say and do. 

I'm sure people are torn about the Evil Dead remakes, as we are with most remakes, but I for one am enjoying Evil Dead for the first time. I'm still not on board with campy humor in horror but if they keep doing these anthology type stories for Evil Dead then I'm here for it. ",normal

"Doubt has got to be one of the most stressful and intense films without being an outright thriller  I saw it a few years ago. I liked it but it didn‚Äôt linger enough. I decided to rewatch it‚Ä¶ wow! Now it did. Maybe I just needed to be older but gosh the whole atmosphere just oozes tension. Every scene feels like a pin dropping. I didn‚Äôt go to a catholic school but if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like I feel bad for anyone that did. 

The cast is brilliant! Meryl Streep‚Äôs character of course starts out as the stern disciplinarian. But by the end you see she‚Äôs just as afraid and unsure as anyone. Philip Seymour Hoffman character? I had no idea if he did it or not. I want to believe he didn‚Äôt and he really convinces me. But at the same time I know there‚Äôs just no way to be sure. I honestly forgot what a versatile actor he is. Amy Adam‚Äôs plays someone really out of her depth but you feel for her. She‚Äôs really trying. And Viola Davis conveys such quiet desperation and trauma you can feel the pain coming off of her. Her whole scene speaks volumes of the horror she‚Äôs potentially witnessing or aware of, but she can‚Äôt scream or acknowledge any of it. What a hopeless situation.

Nothing big really happens. There‚Äôs no fist fight, explosion, murder, not even a true resolution. But it feels so real because that‚Äôs usually how life is. I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter if he did it or not. The point is there‚Äôs so much in life you can‚Äôt be sure of. And it‚Äôs hard on everybody. I watched it last week but still can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I haven‚Äôt seen a film in a while that‚Äôs made me do that.

"Review of ""The Substance"" (2024) This is my personal opinion, pls don't hate me.

""The Substance"" is a dystopian, almost cyberpunk-esque film that commentates on aging, body dysmorphia, and self-hatred. While its themes are very relevant in today's society, I believe that the way which Fargeat (the writer & director) handled said themes was, perhaps, too obvious in its execution. With little to no nuance at all, ""The Substance"" stands as a film which focuses too much on in-the-face (literally) partial nudity and grotesque body horror. At what point does showing a close-up of Margaret Qualley's ass in a pink leotard become gratuitous? Additionally, this film handles allusions with a seeming idea that the audience is moronic. To place a badly done flashback of another scene when we are supposed to remember it at this new moment feels like an insult from the director.

Furthermore, ""The Substance"" feels like a film centered around shock factor, especially at the end. The revelation of the Russian Roulette of Elisabeth's could have been executed well if not for the over-the-top blood bath done for no real reason. Additionally, the nudity in this scene (i.e. throwing up a whole boob, wtf??) is unnecessary and feels like another ploy to add as many nipples in one film as you can. Not to mention the dancer's being nude, as well. On Live T.V.? In general, I can see the appeal to this movie but I believe that it is nothing more than a surface-level, attention-grabber film that has little ""substance,"" if you will, than that.",normal

"Favorite movie by european country: Finland Hello there,

yesterday, I've asked you for the most favorite movie set in Estonia and I have to admit: I'm really surprised at how many different films were entered into the race. Accordingly, the votes were very evenly spread and even though there may have been even closer results with a lower turnout, I think it was even closer this time thanks to your strong support: the runner-up scored 15 points this time, while our winner only scored 2 more - and that despite a very high turnout: Congrats to ***Vehkleja*** (engl.: *The Fencer*).

If I've understood it correctly, the movie is set in Estonia, but by a finnish director. This leads us directly to the next country, because today we are looking for your favorite movie set in **Finland**. As everytime, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

"Just rewatched Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind and did Joel killed a girl when he was a kid? Spoilers ahead: It's kind of hard to follow when they both are running from memory to memory and in them they can do new stuff the memory maybe didn't do, however, a flashback when as adult they are playing asphixiation with pillow kinda confirms he did really, as a kid, put a pillow to that girl, and kids being kids, I wouldn't be surprised if he killed her while playing?

Can anyone confirm or disconfirm this?

to elaborate:

the movie doesn't stop to explain everything, thats why at the end we don't get to see if the hidden memories will even start to be remembered or not, they just cut it.

Same there, he was with a pillow, and a girl, as kids and that we know it happened, and they cut it.

They were jumping on traumatizing memories, is just playing with pillows traumatizing as smashing a pidgeon with a hammer or getting caught wanking by mom I don't think so, must be he did kill her... or at least is not that impossible to arrive to that possibility?

edit:

here is the scene, skip to end minus 20~ seconds:

even worse, it's the same memory of the bird (she had the pillow same scene, so he went through something semi-traumatic seconds ago wtf, he could easily been not paying much attention to what he was doing)",normal
"Best song by a fictitious movie band Fictional movie bands and characters have put out some absolute bangers over the years. From Coco's Miguel; to Sex-Bomb-Omb; to The Soggy Bottom Boys,  they cover lots of different genres and styles.

I don't think I've seen a film where a juror is guilty of the crime he's on the jury for. I was never bored. Had interesting characters on the jury, especially the retired cop. I think there should be more films like this.!<

>!Favourite part - When the juror who was a cop came in with his research about all the cars being repaired and started narrowing it down to 15 suspects. That was like some Columbo level deduction. That character should have stayed in more. I was upset when he was struck from the jury but it makes sense for the plot.!<

>!Ending - I quite liked it. It leaves ambiguity as to what happened which makes sense since there's moral ambiguity about the whole situation.!<

Thoughts of lack of full release - I don't understand that. It has a full release in the UK - plays regularly across many cinemas. I watched today in mid afternoon in UK and was as full as any high grossing film you'd see at this time and I go to the cinema a lot.

"Most modern Blu-Ray and 4k cases are just so UGLY!!! Will we ever see nicer looking standard boxes again? I find Blu-Ray cases kind of hard to take seriously. They look more like video-game cases than for films (and I never liked Playstation's cases to begin with).

I was recently looking up which is the best version of the Lord of the Rings series to buy, and something I've been struck by is how there has been no attempt to do anything better than the original Extended Edition DVD boxes, with their beautiful faux-leather cases.

Considering physical media has obviously been on the downtick (although anecdotally, a lot of my own friends have started moving back to physical over the past year or two), it seems like having more beautiful cases that would actually look nice on a shelf would be a huge selling point.

For myself (being a gamer), I've found myself oddly enamored by the Nintendo Switch game cases, but since those only house tiny SD cards, it's nothing that would really be replicable for various kinds of DVD. I also know that Blu-Ray is kind of a ""brand"" in and of itself, so they're probably hesitant to get away from using the color blue -- but *god* do those things look destined for a landfill.

I know the old black plastic cases weren't exactly exciting to look at, but I certainly prefer them over Blu Rays sitting on a shelf. In fact, I'll likely just do what my friends do and just get a case to hold all my discs in a space-efficient manner, and then just chuck the cases themselves in the trash.

> This holiday entry, which could almost have been called A Fast & Furious Christmas, is so ugly, artificial and overlong that it should cure kids of any belief in magic. It‚Äôs a prime example of the ways in which CG effects have impoverished the imaginations of many contemporary filmmakers ‚Äî making anything possible, but too often at the expense of a human heartbeat. In any case, Red One is the equivalent of a lump of coal in your Christmas stocking.

-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-evans-christmas-1236054244/)

> I‚Äôm not sure that a Hollywood movie has ever kicked off the season with less true Christmas spirit than ‚ÄúRed One.‚Äù Sure, J.K. Simmons plays Santa Claus (who gets abducted), and Simmons is winning in his crinkly old wise innocence. Dwayne Johnson, as Santa‚Äôs bodyguard (who wants to retire because he‚Äôs having a crisis of faith), is his outsize amiable self. The odd thing about the movie is that while it‚Äôs a little bit tongue-in-cheek, it‚Äôs not really a comedy. Directed with charmless energy by Jake Kasdan, ‚ÄúRed One‚Äù is at once an action movie; a kidnap-rescue thriller in which the doors to supply closets in toy stores are mystic portals; and an exercise in Christmas world-building, as if that‚Äôs the thing that‚Äôs been missing from Christmas.

-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-hemsworth-j-k-simmons-1236199619/)

> ‚ÄúRed One‚Äù will make you not only bummed about the holidays ahead, but about cinema‚Äôs future as well. Yet if you‚Äôve been paying attention (and wasting your money at multiplexes in the process), the latter‚Äôs a reality far less shattering than the dawning of Santa Claus‚Äôs own upon a hopeful child. Make it a Christmas miracle, and cross this ‚ÄúRed One‚Äù off your list.

-[Ryan Lattanzio, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-1235062639/): D

> Yes, it‚Äôs cheesy, but this movie is best when it leans heavily into the cheese. If that makes your eyes roll, keep in mind this is a Christmas movie ultimately intended for kids who‚Äôve made it all the way through the MCU on Disney+ twice and their parents now need a reprieve. There are still some jokes aimed at the cold-hearted adult who will inevitably be dragged along on the family cinema outing.

-[Glenn Garner, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/11/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-evans-1236165948/)

> The most important thing I can tell you about Jake Kasdan‚Äôs ‚ÄúRed One‚Äù is that yes, it‚Äôs a real film starring Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans as a mismatched action movie odd couple rescuing a kidnapped Santa Claus, and not a ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù parody. And it‚Äôs not nearly as awful as it sounds.

-[William Bibbiani, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-evans-christmas-movie/)

> There‚Äôs nothing wrong with a big-hearted film for Christmas, but this commercial and formulaic slice of content is a toy destined to be forgotten, not by Boxing Day, but mid-November.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/06/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-evans-santa-kidnapped): 1/5

> Most disappointing of all is that there‚Äôs a moment right out of the incredible scene at the start of 2010‚Äôs The Other Guys, when Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson leap off a tall building in pursuit of suspects as though their swagger will save them, only to splat on the pavement and die. In Red One, Johnson does the exact same thing unironically, diving off Santa‚Äôs tower after his captors, then swinging off other structures and finding his way into a snowmobile-chase sequence. It doesn‚Äôt look like there‚Äôs room for that kind of self-deprecation in Johnson‚Äôs career anymore.

-[Alison Willmore, Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-netflixs-red-one-will-remind-you-of-better-movies.html)

> The movie's shining light is JK Simmons as a muscly Santa who can easily do 500 press-ups in five minutes. He manages to sell the schmaltzy lines and is a great fit as Saint Nick in his second Santa movie outing following Netflix's exceptional Klaus. Unfortunately, the plot means he's off-screen after the first act and the movie suffers for it. You're also left with an overwhelming confusion over who Red One is actually aimed at. The humour is largely too juvenile for adults, but the language is also too crude for young ones. Even the villain Gr√Ωla (a wasted Kiernan Shipka, who mostly just glares at the camera) is likely too scary for the youngest viewers.

-[Ian Sandwell, Digital Spy](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a62801725/red-one-review/): 2/5

> A simpler adventure might have amplified that feel-good message, but Red One, which reportedly cost $250 million, lumbers over its two-hour runtime. The story introduces other fantastical organisations ‚Äî Liu plays the director of a group that monitors magical figures ‚Äî and even checks in on Santa‚Äôs coldhearted brother Krampus (Kristofer Hivju). The slathered-on CGI is often unsightly, and Shipka rarely gets a moment to shine. Still, Simmons makes for an endearing, unironic Santa whose passion for his job has never wavered. At its best, Red One embodies that lightness, balancing it with the overwhelming dictates of a big-budget spectacle ‚Äî but not nearly often enough. 

-[Tim Grierson, Screen Daily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/red-one-review/5198830.article): 2/5

> Making a truly classic Christmas movie is hard; despite a slew of new ones every year, the last crop of true classics date back to 2003. But you still have to approach them with genuine goodwill in your heart, not some focus-group scores and aspirations of a shared holiday universe. If this had just reined in the bombast and focused on the characters, it might have been something. As it is, it‚Äôs an awfully big box for such a small amount of cheer.

"‚ÄòThe White Ribbon‚Äô has a haunting lesson Michael Haneke's ""White Ribbon"" is a movie I didn't understand when I saw it, but have ruminated on since.  It's relevance becomes more terrifying every year. 

As I searched it online today, I came across a fellow Redditor's insightful analysis.  This part stood out:  

""... What Haneke demonstrates is that Nazis are not that special. They were children that lived through an incredibly tumultuous and painful period in German history, and as such, many grew to not have faith in anything. Their leaders, their social structure, the older generation - all failures in the eyes of the troubled, abandoned German youth. This, Haneke argues, makes people susceptible to radicalization.""

"Inception not as good as people say? Been hearing about how good it was and just watched it now and is actually a bit disappointed.

I know a lot of people love Inception and think it's one of Christopher Nolan's best films, but l've never really understood the hype. Sure, the visuals are stunning, and the concept of dreams within dreams is interesting, but it feels like the story gets bogged down by all the exposition and complex rules. 

To me, it's almost like the movie is trying too hard to be deep, and it ends up being confusing rather than thought-provoking.

Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the characters don't have much depth, and I didn't really feel emotionally connected to any of them. Inception is cool to watch, but when it comes to movies that make you question reality, I think there are better ones out there.

Anyone else feel this way, or am I totally alone on this?

"I'm obsessed with everything having to do with movies Alright guys, I can't hold it in any longer. Especially since I have no one to turn to with a confession as strong as this one. So I'm turning to Reddit to express what it is I'm so obsessed about: Movies.

I never feel as happy or elated when I go and see a movie at a theater all by myself. Sometimes I watch 3 movies in a row (I have a membership at my local theater of course) and I admittedly have the time of my life. Embarrassingly enough, each time I receive my ticket from the employee, on my way to the theater I sometimes might do a little jump of excitement accompanied by the biggest, cheek-hurting smile I'll produce that day. A tear of two might stream down my face. If anyone saw me, which I try to ensure no one does, they might think I'm going crazy. In a way, I am.

I am crazy, absolutely crazy for movies. I want to watch every movie ever made. Of course, the greatest, most memorable moviegoing experiences have been the films that touch my heart and my imagination so strongly, that I'm crying, applauding internally, and yelling in my head ""yes! YES! YES!!!!!!!"". But I don't care if it's a good or bad romcom, action movie, noir, foreign movie, documentary, short film or horror film - I want to see them all. ALL OF THEM. To me, quantity is just as important as quality, as odd as that sounds. Why? It's in the title. I'm obsessed. I'll be going to the movies tonight. I'm excited beyond words, beyond description, beyond comprehension, beyond rationality.

"I Really Enjoyed The Crow Remake Am I the only one who enjoyed the remake of The Crow with Bill Skarsgard?  I know it got a lot of flack, but I wonder if maybe some people dismissed it simply out of loyalty to Brandon Lee & his untimely death filming the original.

I think it's awful what happened to Brandon Lee (I remember it happening!); however, I don't think it's off-limits to make another Crow movie.  After watching it, I saw that it really wasn't much like the original AT ALL.  The premise of him coming back to life to enact vengeance after the wrongful death of him and his girlfriend was the same, but other than that, it was so so different.

And Bill Skarsgard killed it as Eric Draven!  Even FKA Twigs was good.  I think she's super weird looking, but she has this magnetism about her to where I can see why people are drawn to her.  Even her lisp is somewhat charming.",normal
"is toy story or shrek more responsible for the rise of computer animated movies? as you've all no doubt noticed, pretty much every animated movie nowadays, at least in america, is computer animated. the only animated movies that aren't tend to be based on 2D shows. over the course of the 2010s, only 4 animated movies were hand drawn. winnie the pooh, spongebob squarepants sponge out of water, my little pony the movie, and teen titans go to the movies. 3 of those 4 movies were based on 2D animated shows.

in your opinion, which film is more responsible for this? toy story or shrek?

on the one hand, toy story was the first computer animated feature length movie. as such, computer animation as we know it owes alot of it's existence to toy story. on the other hand, shrek kinda popularized it. it was super successful when it came out and was even the first movie to win the academy award for best animated feature?",normal

"If CIG is so expensive, why does everyone use it now a days for mundane, simple things? I often hear CIG is incredibly expensive. And since a movies budget is obviously a huge deal, why are we relying now a days so heavily on CIG, especially for such mundane and simple things?
CIG has its place no doubt, but its just the excessive unnessecary usage that bothers me.

Creating a visual appealing scene is just often times done through post processing effects, layers up on layers. Fog is most of the time just a post proccessing effect, what happened to the smoke machine? 

Animals get completely switched out with their CIG counterparts. Literally just having a simple cockroach in your movie or series just gets animated. Sure a lion attacking a human is hard to make practical but a god damn insect crawling on the ground or on a human? 

Obviously you have much more control in cig than with practical stuff but the thing is that most of the time you can see that its not ""real"" and therefore you are not creating a convincing immersfull image and atmosphere. So your creative control of how every effect is playing out becomes irrelevant, its not worth it. 

And this is not exclusive to just big budget movies. This even happens with smaller productions and series which are on a tight budget.

Edit: I mispelled CGI, sorry.",normal
Movies like The Killer (2023)  This movie was sooooo good. I really like Finchers style of directing so I love almost all of his movies but this one really surprised me since it got very mixed reviews.

But I just love the atmosphere of it and the narration and the pace was good and I just thought the story was very interesting and the main character was likeable. I really like crime dramas so anything about hit men is good anything that‚Äôs a thriller is good and just whatever you can think of that has similarities of any kind.

"White nights,one of the few books that turned into a movie correctly I recently watched White Nights and loved it. It‚Äôs such a rare example of a book that actually makes a smooth transition to film. The movie captured the emotions, atmosphere, and beauty of the original story really well. It stayed true to the book‚Äôs themes and brought the characters to life in a way that felt genuine. You can tell the filmmakers really cared about Dostoevsky‚Äôs vision and put effort into keeping the soul of the story intact.

It‚Äôs kind of rare to find adaptations like this. Sometimes, movies based on books feel rushed or off-track, losing the heart of the story in favor of flashy scenes or added drama that wasn‚Äôt needed.

"Insane Hong Kong horror movie  I think some of you probably have already guessed it, the movie I'm talking about is obviously The Boxer's Omen (1983)! It's a Hong Kong folk horror with a strong psychedelic influence that will bring you to a wild and chaotic adventure around different places in Asia

If I haven't convinced you yet, let me tell you that it can be seen quite as an oriental and male version of Dario Argento's Suspiria but with thai boxe as a background instead of classical dance, and that it has also many elements and common points with greek mythology stories. It has an evidently low budget but it sure is an interesting project and you won't be disappointed!

"For an hour and 40 minutes Music By John Williams just filled me with joy  Been a pretty stressy day and I'm not even from America haha - this was the perfect antidote.

"The Perfection  An example of a film with an excellent beginning but a very disappointing ending.

This movie gripped me from the start - from the two young women getting to know each other in the music school in China, to that scene on the bus.... God, the scene on the bus probably had me on edge more than most other movie scenes I've ever watched.

So why did it have to lose its momentum and go so very much downhill in the second half? Too many plot twists, I think! One is fine, two or three is too many.

So what do you think? Too many plot twists resulting in a confused mess?  One or two good scenes in a bad movie? Or a bad movie overall...? A good movie overall...?",normal

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

"""The Crow"" 2024 is bad (how brave, yea?).  Okay, I know that this movie is hated and if ""Borderlands"" hadn't come out, it would have been considered the worst movie of this year. But I want to take the movie apart from the comic book and movie and say that if they didn't exist, this movie would still be bad. 

In the story, Eric and his girlfriend are killed and he returns from the dead. 

Let's start with the main problem. The love line is not working. She's been given about 30 minutes here, and it would seem that in that time you can tie us to the characters. But not here. When the characters escape from the drug dispensary, the only thing they do is have sex and take drugs, and there is also a montage in the form of a music video about love. That's all. And because of this, it's funny when the characters say phrases from the category: ""Everyone will remember our great love."" You were just two addicts with a powerful libido, what kind of great love are we talking about? 

Secondly, the movie is boring. After Eric's resurrection, the film seemed to become a set of pretentious phrases for a beautiful picture. I fell asleep while watching and woke up when the characters stopped talking with pretentious speeches and the action began, and there is surprisingly little of it here. But about him later.

The third. The actors are mostly bad. Bill Skarsgard seemed to be the only one trying to play (and overplayed), the others all mind ""I'm only here for the money"", and FKA Twigs seemed to be on drugs all the time. 

Their characters turned out to be bad. They are boring, repulsive and cardboard. Here, the main characters are being strangled, they are about to die, but you don't care so much, because they didn't manage to make them pleasant for the viewer in 35 minutes. 

The main villain seemed to be taken from ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"". An old man with demonic powers who is supposed to scare, but in fact he is boring and does not cause a drop of fear.

And action scenes. The only good part of the film, because the same scene with the opera was done very well, although the rest of the action scenes looked like another version of John Wick. But there doesn't seem to be much action here, as if it barely lasts up to 20 minutes in total.

As a result, it feels like everything bad that was in the superhero movies of the 2000s was shoved here. That's all.

"*Anora* Had So Much Potential, But Just Fell Short... Anyone Else Feel the Same? ü§î  

Hey everyone! I saw *Anora* last night, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it‚Äînot because it was amazing, but because it was *almost* amazing. I feel like it had all the right elements, but it just didn‚Äôt quite deliver. I‚Äôm curious if anyone else felt the same way?

The dialogue was realistic, which I usually love, but it wasn‚Äôt snappy enough to keep up with the already slow pace. I kept waiting for the characters to have one of those memorable, sharp exchanges, but it just dragged. And don‚Äôt even get me started on Vanya. While Anora was fleshed out beyond her job (which I thought was refreshing‚Äîno sob story, just a strong character), Vanya felt like a cardboard cutout. He had zero interesting traits, and I kept wondering why he was there.

On the bright side, the visuals and soundtrack were incredible! It was a total sensory treat‚Ä¶ until it started feeling *too* long. Some scenes just lingered without adding much, you know? And then the ending‚Ä¶ I was so ready for it to redeem itself, but Anora‚Äôs actions in that last scene were frustrating.

"V for Vendetta (2005) - How relevant is it today One of the things I find fascinating about this film is that it's message doesn't change but how that message is interpreted seems to change depending on what generation you are in. It's obviously a very political movie and it's interesting to see how everyone on either side of the political divide watch this film and think the movie is ""on their side"".

I've heard folks who are more conservative comment on the medical experimentation, controlled language and lockdowns and say that is proof they are the films audience. Simultaneously on the other end of the political spectrum, those liberal folks look at that story of the young woman who was next to V's cell in the containment facility and think it validates their beliefs.

It's bizarre how nuanced storytelling has fallen to the wayside these days and everything needs to be polarizing because everyone wants to be validated. Ironically on both sides, they ignore the very first speech V gives at the TV station where he says ""if you're looking for someone to blame, you need only look in the mirror"". This couldn't be more true today as it was back then. He didn't fault one group of people for the state of affairs because it's everyone's responsibility to recognize when an idea has evolved into extremism, regardless of your political view. Even more ironic, is the idea that blowing up parliament was sticking it to one side or another, especially when you consider Guy Fawkes was catholic and by today's standards would be considered very conservative yet that's the mask V chose to wear. The man himself or any label attached to him was irrelevant, the idea is what was important.

We've forgotten that people are more than these labels we choose to attach to them. We've become so obsessed with putting ourselves in these categories, but labels by their definition are ""exclusive"". Anyone who doesn't fall under that label is automatically an outsider and it's gotten to the point where we've just stopped listening to each other altogether and stopped caring about each other. The opening monologue of the film underscores where we are really well...""you cannot kiss an idea, you cannot touch it or hold it...ideas don't love"".

- Froy Gutierrez was BAD. A one-note performance. 

- Small town cliche where most people are weird towards out-of-towners because‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre‚Ä¶from out of town??

- ‚ÄúIs Tamara here?‚Äù THREE TIMES? Was the first step in the killers‚Äô plan to just be annoying??

- Dude just borrows the beat-up motorcycle that the owner leaves the keys too but never mentions?? To ride into town to get his inhaler that he hardly ends up needing? That his gf forgot to pack? You‚Äôre an adult. That‚Äôs YOUR inhaler. It‚Äôs not her responsibility!

- BF says the GF was just high and saw a mask in the room. How fucking high was she?? It was an adult woman standing 3 feet in front of her!

- The couple just sits up against a wall and casually watch the hooded dude chop through the door. They do NOTHING. Never seen that in a horror movie. 

- In the bathroom, BF says ‚ÄúWe need a weapon‚Äù then a couple seconds later ‚ÄúI found one‚Äù. Again, casually. So silly.

"Plot hole in all movies set in the future There is an inherent gaping plot hole in every movie set in the future. Why don't they know about the movie?

For example, Terminator 2 is set in 1995. Nobody seems to have heard of the 1985 hit movie 'Terminator'. People never even heard the word, which is obvious when we hear how the doctors at the mental asylum discuss Sarah Connor's ""maniac delusion"".

OK, let's say Terminator 1 somehow never existed in the timeline of the movie. But then, how come the police never recognized that the guy who massacred an entire police precinct in 1984 was a perfect doppelganger of that Austrian bodybuilder guy turned actor, who played in the 1987 hit movie 'Predator' and others?

Maybe 'Predator' doesn't exist either, and neither does Arnold Schwarzenegger. (Imagine a post-credits scene where Arnie is being arrested for multiple counts of murder...) But then, we must assume James Cameron doesn't exist either, because he apparently never made the first Terminator. Then he likely also never made Aliens, The Abyss and True Lies.

All right, but what made these people and these movies disappear? Did Skynet eliminate them before sending the first Terminator, so they won't foil the plan?

Mel Brooks called this paradox out in Spaceballs.",normal
"What is your theory on what truly happened in ""Anatomy of a Fall""? I still think the father, Samuel (Samuel Theiss), killed himself. He was self-loathing and unhappy and blamed Sandra (Sandra Huller) for how his life turned out. 

I didn't think the film indicated Sandra had enough motivation for murder. At best, they could have fought and he ended up tripping and falling, an accidental death. Sandra was self-centered and cruel, flaunting her affairs in her husband's face and destroying any self-esteem he could have by bringing up his failures at life. Still, those weren't good reasons for her to turn into a black widow. 

By the end, I did expect a possible twist, an indication she might be guilty. It never happened. Sandra is exhausted and wants to move on, forget the trauma. I liked how the film remains ambiguous, we don't get a clear answer so it's up for the viewer to decide what transpired in the chalet.",normal

"What's Marxist About The Gospel According To St. Matthew (1964)- Pasolini's movie? As a Christian who loves movies and Biblical epics, **The Gospel According To St. Matthew,** Pasolini's film, is my favorite movie of all time.

I've heard a lot about how Pasolini intended it to be a Marxism allegory. What is Marxist about it?

The movie literally quotes the book of Matthew, nearly verbatim in terms of dialogue. (One of the biggest reasons why I love it so much.)

**Where does the Marxism allegory come in?**

PS, for any non-religious people reading this, Pasolini was an atheist, and Roger Ebert gave it 4/4 stars.

Cause in theory the film has everything that I should love so idk why it didn't hit and felt quite empty to me.

Every person I found on the internet or yt who didn't like it was quite dumb and giving senseless critiques that I didn't agree with. 

So ig I'm trying to say, is there anyone who didn't like this movie?  If so, please do share (IF your reason goes beyond the usual critiques of The Critical Drinker or other youtubers with a superiority complex)

2. Recommend a movie directed by a female, ideally, which is a fun entertainer made for enjoyment and escapism, not revolving around female-centric issues. A film that explores female desires, life, and experiences. It could be an entertaining film of a few girls.

characters preaching about feminism all the time. I want a film that passes the Ellen Willis Test (female characters having aspirations).",normal
"Found Something Beautiful (and need your help) I assume that everyone who belongs to this Reddit has seen a ton of movies.

I have to say one of the most beautiful things is when you stumble upon a movie, or a group of movies of a certain genre or with a certain actor or a certain director that you‚Äôd never seen but just totally click with you. Sometimes you get in ruts where every movie seems like a reiteration of a previous one and it feels so refreshing when you find something new that feels different.

This happened with me and Albert Brooks movies. I only knew him from finding Nemo and this is 40 and can‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôve been missing. I saw broadcast news and loved that movie tremendously and specifically his character. His sense of humor and anxiety and his self deprecation just hit the sweetest spot for me and so I sought out more. I watched Defending Your Life, Modern Romance, and Real Life. Similar but different I was also recommended the Big Chill based on this interest and loved that one so much I bought the dvd right after.

1. Have you experienced this? If so what was the movie, actor, director, etc.?

2. I was born in the 90s and missed the bulk of these 80s movies and was wondering if you had any suggestions for movies similar to these Albert Brooks ones I mentioned and the big chill?

"Bob Roberts - More people should see this movie during elections!  This is a great Tim Robbins movie about the campaign of a slimy, deceptive right wing candidate for the Senate. It has some real acting depth (Tim Robbins, Giancarlo Esposito, Gore Vidal, Alan Rickman and many others - even a turn by a young Jack Black). It even includes an attempted assassination that the candidate milks for sympathy. In the movie, Roberts is a folk singer who sings songs on the campaign trail, but the songs are all right-wing oriented. Rumor has it in real life that Robbins refused to release the soundtrack independently lest it be used for right-wing purposes in real life. Although the movie is over 30 years old, it speaks to the soullessness of politics in a way that is still very relatable.",normal

"Watched every Paranormal Activity movie last week. (ranking/review). Had the urge to watch every Paranormal Activity movie since I never watched 5,6,7. So I watched them all in order. Extremely fun horror movies. Id honestly say they are all close to each other besides Ghost Dimension and Next of Kin. Personally Id rank them. ( 2,1,3,4,5,7,6 ). The one thing I gathered is that they did a really good job tying the movies together.

PA 2: definitely the best and scariest all around. The most well made, ties into the first one nicely. The staircase scene is terrifying as well as the Kitchen explosion. The ending is slightly underwhelming but is fine. 

PA: The Original holds up well. gives you just enough information to make your imagination go. simple and straight to the point. Fuck Micah though. I do wish there was a few more Tobi encounters, a shadow or two. But In this franchise its just hard to beat the original. 

PA 3: Not many prequels do franchises justice but they did a great job with the story. The ending was what did it for me. I knew the grandmother was part of something when she mentioned trying to have a son to the mother. But when Julie doesn‚Äôt return and Denis slowly starts to find out about the Occult the movie switches a gear. 

PA 4: Is the middle ground. The marked ones and 4 are interchangeable. Theres nothing ground breaking about 4 but theres nothing bad about it either. Realizing Katie is the mother was a jump scare. And again the ending was intense. 

The Marked ones: I loved it. It was refreshing to get away from Katie at least relatively. I know I keep talking about the endings but this ending was WILD. Not only the shotgun scene and the Grandmothers ranch, but going through the portal door to tie into the first movie was insane! Id put this movie higher but I just thought the other movies before it were a little better. 

Next of Kin: ill just start by saying this would be a better movie if it wasnt part of the Paranormal franchise. It was a great Found Footage film. but just not a great addition to the franchise. Beautiful cinematography. Some really good ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moments. Finding the computer closet, and the conversation with the mailman. My biggest gripe is that The movie broke away from being Found Footage twice and I just couldnt look past it. 

Ghost Dimension: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶felt like a direct to DVD movie. The CGI was terrible and distracting. The monster reveal was extremely underwhelming. I wanted Tobi to be more demonic paimon looking. Some concepts were cool. The part where they find out they were set up and lured to buy that house was scary. When they realized the real estate agent was part of the cult made me say ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù.

"Can a bad performance ruin a movie, and if yes, which one (and say why)? Millie Perkins as Anne Frank in ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" is a good example.

This isn't just a mediocre performance, this was a performance that is downright amauterish, literally no emotion in almost every line she says. She was Ali MacGraw bad. And it ruined the movie for me because I couldn't get over it. As superb as the supporting actors were, Shellley Winters even won an Oscar, Perkins made it impossible for the movie to rise above its flawed central casting.

I think everything in this movie works. I didn't even mind Matthew Broderick or Leslie Mann being wasted in a girlfriend part. Broderick works as a straight man to Carrey's character, even if I didn't find Broderick charismatic enough to worth all that work from Carrey.

1.) He's an engineer so he must know that panicking increases heart rate and thus oxygen consumption. But he's just panicking like he's never trained for these type of scenarios. He's thoughtless and doesn't think of ways to conserve his oxygen. This almost proved crucial.
2.) Heck, Rain from Alien: Romulus was more battle-ready than this guy and Rain is a teenage girl.
3.) He also left Dwayne, his only chance for survival and company at the time.
4.) Didn't even think of taking his rations with him or salvaging from the other pods. I wouldn't even leave my Fire Extinguisher when it was thrown out of his pod since it could be of some use.
5.) The movie portrayed Dwayne as some crazy guy when he's the one who would actually likely to survive in these type of scenarios.
6.) Bugs are pecking his suit and he's not shooing them away immediately?
7.) The spider monsters stopped chasing him and I already figured out it must be because it's a territory of another predator. But he was clueless.
8.) Why didn't he just make his way to the Borealis first to find some oxygen supply instead of risking it to Naomi immediately?!<

"Should the recent Halloween sequels have been based on Halloween 1 or on Halloween 1 and 2? Hi,

I am curious about your point of view. 

The recent Halloween sequels are only based on Halloween 1. All the other sequels are ignored.


However i loved Halloween 2 and would have loved that the recent sequels were based on Halloween 1 and 2. I see these movies as one movie. I actually liked that Laurie and Michael were brother and sister. And it also establishes more of that feeling that he was after her. Even after being shot 6 times he still came after her in the hospital. That really made her feel that she would never be safe wherever she goes.

What your opinion about if the Halloween sequels should have been based on Halloween 1 or on 1 and 2?

>While PIP sadly lacks the absurdist wit and decidedly dark edges that elevated the first two Paddington films, it‚Äôs serviceable enough given its limitations.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/11/paddington-in-peru-review-olivia-colman-antonio-banderas-1236166060/):

>It doesn‚Äôt matter if this film is much the same sort of thing as the last one, warmed over. In fact, that‚Äôs exactly what you want: third time around, the story of the little bear welcomed by strangers remains magical.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/paddington-in-peru-review-1236198939/):

>‚ÄúPaddington in Peru‚Äù is, as any Paddington adventure should be, fast and buoyant and disarmingly sunny in a way that viewers who weren‚Äôt alive -- or at least of cinemagoing age -- for the 2017 release of ‚ÄúPaddington 2‚Äù will lap up.

[HeyUGuys](https://www.heyuguys.com/paddington-in-peru-review/) (5/5):

[Flick Feast](https://www.flickfeast.co.uk/reviews/film-reviews/paddington-peru/) (4/5):

>Paddington in Peru takes a bit of time to find its bearings but ends up delivering all the Paddington feels you hoped for.

>It's a welcome return for Paddington and the Brown family who in this installment journey to Peru to see his beloved Aunt Lucy. Antonio Banderas chews scenery with varying results but Olivia Colman is pitch-perfect as the all-singing all-dancing Reverend Mother. Paddington's latest adventure may be the weakest of the films so far but it remains a total delight.

>Grown-ups, however, might feel (as I did) that a little of the intrinsic charm and fun is lost by plucking Paddington away from London... On the other paw, it‚Äôs a pleasure to spend an hour and 43 minutes with Paddington in any setting.

[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241103-paddington-in-peru-review-paddington-2) (4/5):
>Paddington in Peru offers a fun and lively hour-and-three-quarters in the cinema, and that's not to be sniffed at, but it comes across as the solid third part of an established franchise rather than a stellar pop-cultural phenomenon in its own right.

>Well, the bad news is that Paddington in Peru isn‚Äôt as good as Paddington 2. The good news is that Wilson has made an entertaining and endearing yarn that is worth 106 minutes of your time.

[The Film Stage](https://thefilmstage.com/paddington-in-peru-review-threequel-fails-to-climb-to-franchise-heights/) (C+):

>It‚Äôs clearly a disappointment compared to the two King-directed efforts, but is not without moments of comic inspiration, enjoyable supporting performances, and well-engineered adventure blockbuster set pieces.

[Empire Magazine](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/paddington-in-peru/) (3/5):

>The Paddington series goes 'Raiders of The Lost Bear', swapping Primrose Hill for the savage jungles of Peru. It's a decent threequel, though a little of the enchantment has been lost in transit.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/paddington-in-peru-movie-review-1235061942/) (C+):

>There‚Äôs no denying that even Paul King‚Äôs table scraps taste better than most of what family audiences have been served over the last six years.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/04/paddington-in-peru-review) (3/5):
>This Paddington threequel is a perfectly decent bet for the holidays, and never anything other than entertaining, but the gag density has thinned out and removing Paddington from Blighty... is a slightly shark-jumping move.

[The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/paddington-in-peru-review/) (3/5):

>Let‚Äôs be fair: absolutely no one will have a bad time at Paddington in Peru, which is bouncy, unobjectionable and raises plenty of smiles. But most viewers are likely to come out more sated than elated.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/paddington-in-peru-review/):

>The new film has some heart, but it‚Äôs buried beneath a lot of hackneyed writing and tedious padding. Like, a ton of padding. A padding ton.

"what websites do you all use to find good movies/shows? I usually trust rottentomato scores, much more than imdb. My issue is the filters aren't fine grained. You can't filter for ratings above a certain percentage score, nor can you filter by number of reviews for either audience or critic.

Is there a 3rd party website where I can search like that? I think I came across a website where you could filter by score but not number of reviews. It resulted in quite a few movies or documentaries with only one or two reviews total, but they were 100% rating so they showed up in the results. I'd like to filter that stuff out.

"That's some real shit on camera - Babylon review Babylon is one of the most mediocre moments I have ever felt watching a movie by myself on my computer screen at home. And yet I would have loved to experience it in the cinemas. I would have liked to know how so many people reacted to the sheer chaos on the screen. I would have liked to see how many got teary eyed like me in the finale. I would have loved to talk to people afterwards to see if they were willing to share more about what they thought about the early days of cinema. 

I didn't think Damien Chazzelle could create an informative and telling tale about the early cinema that was R rated and ran for 3 hours long and had a stupendously roaring loud screenplay to go with it but that's exactly what he did with Babylon.

Margot Robbie plays a triumphant Harley Quinn-like character who never stops ****ING up things in her life, Diego Calva in the first movie I have ever seen him in, stands out as a capable leading man who's entertaining to watch and Brad Pitt plays a established Hollywood star who's ready to be replaced much like DiCaprio's character in Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood. 

8.5/10 an often times cartoonish attempt to capture the wild roaring essence of the well, roaring '20s that falls flat in trying to be scary and nuanced at so many turns but when it works, it's magic. 


Similar movies: I saw a bit of ""Moulin Rouge"" in the movie's first party scene and the narrative setup feels carried on or atleast inspired from Once Upon a Time in.... Hollywood.

Leaving question: What is your fav Damien Chazzelle ending? ",normal

"My Best friend's wedding (1997) Just watched the movie for the first time qnd I wasn't around for the nineties, so I have more modern sensibilities, and i'm a bit shocked. 

Yes julianne is awful, but michael is far worse in my opinion, and he should not be getting married to Jimmy when he acts how he does. He's way too close to his best friend being honest with her complementing her half dressed body, being way too intimate with her all while he's engaged to a woman, he clearly doesn't seem to know well enough. It seems like they're still in the honeymoon stages of love, not to mention she can't even legally drink. She's 20 and he's 28. Personally, I do think this is an appropriate age gap. But that aside, he's completely okay with her giving up her career in future to follow him around in his crappy job because of his ego? And then when she tries to change your mind about this, which I understand he's upset, it's last minute, but he basically gaslights her into being submissive and complicit to him??? 
The thing that I don't get is why no one acknowledges michael as the villain? From what i've seen, everyone just seems so caught up with the fact that julianne doesn't end up with michael in the end and thinks it's subversive, but I think michael is the real villain? But I can't find any information of I guess other people agreeing. So my question is when it first came out. Did anyone else think that Michael was the villain? When rewatching it, did people feel that way? I feel like all the focus was on julianne.And michael, just kind of gets a pass for being shitty. 
I just feel like when you rewatch certain movies that you saw as a kid when you're older and you see how problematic, they can be kind of how like I used to like the movie ghosts of a girlfriend's past and then I rewatched it as an adult and was concerned. ",normal
"Back to the Future (the incomplete Eric Stoltz version) It's pretty well known that Eric Stoltz was originally Marty McFly in Back to the Future. The amount of weeks he filmed seem to very from source to source. Sources have said it anywhere from five to seven weeks in total. But I think that it was actually seven weeks. That's nearly the entire movie.

They got rid of Stoltz because he played the part of Marty too seriously, too edgy, and not comedic enough. Check out Futurepedia, the BTTF Wiki. Type in the name ""Eric Stoltz"". You'll see a full list of all the scenes he filmed. I'd really like to see all that footage. It's incomplete, but it'd be like an alternate version of the movie.",normal

"Moon (2009) subverts an overused sci-fi trope The evil AI trope is, I think, overused in movies to the point where it is almost its own subgenre. The initially benevolent artificial intelligence turns evil and the last act is man vs cold unfeeling machine? boring, cliche, played out. 

I just saw Duncan Jones' movie Moon, and I fully expected the AI in it to do what so many lesser sci-fi movies do and go full HAL 9000 on Sam Rockwell - and considering the AI was voiced by Kevin fucking Spacey I wouldn't have been surprised. But the movie's robot companion remains a faithful and loyal servant throughout, and even ends up saving the protagonist in the end. It's very touching and I think means something, because in the end none of the human characters really cared for Sam - his bosses don't care about him because he's a disposable clone, his wife isn't even really his wife, even his original self sold out to the company and allowed his clones to be worked and killed off. In the end, it is a cold, unfeeling machine that is his only aide. 

For a movie that is about man's ability to use technology to serve himself regardless of the moral implications, it's interesting that the robot acts the most ""human"".",normal

"My feelings on the Uglies movie, as someone who read the books multiple times as a teen and just reread them last week I am so disappointed because this series of books is excellent. It was hugely impact full on me as a teen, and I loved them so many times I read them over and over. 

When I saw that the movie had finally come out, I decided to reread them. I have been waiting for this movie for over 15 years. 

I know that highly anticipated media often struggles to meet expectation, but this is just.. *sigh*

1. The brutality sci-fi architecture. While not explicitly explained in the books, I felt it to be too sterile in uglyville. This is a minor complaint. 

2. The introduction of Shay feels.. bad. Wrong? She was never mean to Tally like that in the books. Yes, uglies buly each other but it's not ao mean. 

3. Tally and Peris never had a romance thing between them. Ever. Peris was always only a friend. I have no idea why this seemed to be a storyline at all. Why? Pointless change. 

4. Introducing Dr. Cable as governor of the city + Laverne Cox casting: full miss. Dr Cable is not the governor of the city. This is, again, a needless deviation that doesn't add anything to the movie. 

I like Laverne Cox as an actor, she was great in OITNB and incredibly dynamic. However, she was a huge miss for me on this movie. She's over exaggerating ""serving"" to a cringe point. She's stiff, but not in the ""cruel pretty"" or ""wolfish"" way that Dr. Cable is meant to be. It's just a complete mischaracterization that is very distracting. It feels over acted and comically bad. 

5. I forgot to mention - the beginning of the movie. Why the hell is so much explanatory content smashed into a small montage? And it's like, badly done. AND wrong. In the books, what destroys the Rusties is an oil virus that attacks anything made of petroleum and makes it explosive. This caused an immediate, swift, and violent destruction of society. The white weed is also portrayed incorrectly. The white weed was bioengineered to be able to grow in different climates, and subsequently took over and choked out all plant life. It was not, and was never a power source or something that forces people to live in cities. What the fuck does that even mean? 

6. Tally's reason for leaving to find Shay + burning the weed: the reason why changing the white weed plot line is so detrimental is because it fundamentally changes the story. In the book, the cities are actually trying to maintain the planet, not destroy it with this weed. They are the ones who send out rangers to burn it to prevent it from spreading, which makes this whole scene with David flying a helicopter (when the fuck did David become a helicopter pilot y'all) so fucking dumb. Tally is told that The Smoke is destroying the planet with their clearcutting and burning trees and hunting. Tally leaves because she is told she will remain ugly forever. 

7. Changing the directions to The Smoke: again, a needless plot change. Why? What was wrong eith the original? It was just as interesting, why would it need to be changed at all? And when Tally is in the woods on her way, she starts a fire. That is one of the MAIN THINGS that are taboo in the books, LOL. Like????

8. David is never the leader of the smoke. He never gives a big speech about how they're all revels against the city. The Smoke is, originally, just a small band of people living their lives away from the city. It's not until later that they become rebels. And even then, David is not ""the leader."" There is never any weapon they want to use to take out cities. 

9. Middle pretties are supposed to have a confident wiseness about them. Whoever the actor is for the nurse in the hospital looks like she just came off of a porn set. Middle pretties are supposed to be beautiful, but in a subtle, less flashy, reassuring way. Not.. porny. 

10. Specials sending scouts never happened. The only time the Specials came was when called or alerted by trackers. It's another weird storyline twist to make them seem evil while at the same time doing it in a comedic supervillain way. 

11. The cure is never defined as a weapon, and it isn't something widely known. The cities don't really know it exists until Pretties. There isn't an element of the cure missing that Maddy needs to find. 

12. The Pretty population is too rambunctious. Yes, pretties have a lot of parties. But they're more vapid and aloof. The operation is even referred to as the ""bubblehead"" operation. They're docile, placcid. They are characterized wrong. 

13. Peris is never a special. This is such a weird and wild deviation. Dr. C isn't looking for David. There's never this big confrontation with everyone watching. The entire sequence of the Specials coming is completely wrong. Peris absolutely does not kill Az, and that doesn't happen at The Smoke. He isnt killed as a revenge tactic or to get David to come out. Hes killed in a medical experiment gone wrong. Tally is not called out in front of the entire Smoke, and David doesn't learn about her betrayal until later. 

14. The entire ""rescue"" sequence just had me rolling my eyes, honestly. It's like whoever wrote the script just wrote a 10x worse version of what happened. Like if you played a game of telephone and told someone the whole plot and they had to regurgitate it to you but they missed every key detail. 

15. Again with the evil Peris. I don't even know what to say about that one, it's just so incredibly bad, and a wild misscharacterization for what? For WHAT? Does it even add anything to the movie except a shitty fight scene? Nope!

16. What they ""needed"" for the cure was not an additional part. They needed informed consent. Why does adding an additional part of needing this ingredient so important? Again, what does it actually add to the movie? ""I'll leave you a sign"" no, that doesn't happen either. The whole point is that they smuggle the cure to her in Pretties and she writes this entire note to herself about her informed consent. It's setting up for some other wack ass plotline that's just, again, stupid. 


What I liked: the movie looked nice. Good soundtrack. They got the last words of the book right. 

Tldr: put the book in a blender and pick out 3 scraps of paper and then reconstruct the entire thing into a screenplay, you'll do a better job. ",normal

"In which bad comedy did you laugh with a couple of jokes? So, we watched at least one comedy that we considered bad, but at the same time there was a joke that made us giggle at least. 

For me, it's ""Holmes & Watson"".  Although I do not share the hatred for this comedy, I must admit that it is a good sleeping pill. But there were moments when I giggled and one of them was the phrase: ""Let Watson's name be forever associated with the Titanic.""

"Chalchitra Darpan : Call for Papers Greetings,

Chalchitra Darpan is an undergraduate film journal by Celluloid, the Film Society of Miranda House, University of Delhi. As Delhi University‚Äôs only undergraduate film journal, the inaugural edition (2019-20) was introduced with the vision of building a student community of future film scholars around it. The journal aims to provide an academic space for undergraduates interested in film and media, who wish to explore and engage in film academia. 

The fourth edition of Chalchitra Darpan (2023-24), is in now in the making with the theme : ‚ÄòDo Films Lie?‚Äô

It is an attempt to probe and explore the portrayal of truth in cinematic storytelling, the degree to which narratives can be framed and de-framed to reveal the film‚Äôs perception of truth. The issue of the invocation of creative liberty is to be weighed against distortions of reality. There is philosophical scope herein to even examine the inherent value attributed to truth (the debatability of its existence) and realism. We may refer to the origin of dramatic irony in Sophocles‚Äô Oedipus Rex wherein the audience and the characters are privy to different levels of information which brings forth the question of the existence of different perceptions of the same narrative. Besides the propagation of ‚Äúpropaganda‚Äù films such as Triumph of the Will (1935) which employ grandiose visuals and stirring speeches to create a glorified image of the Nazi regime, there is also the credibility of the category of documentaries and the matter of truth in literary cinematic adaptations, the question of ‚ÄòDo Films Lie‚Äô leaves ample room for contemplation. 

Chalchitra Darpan accepts a variety of written pieces for submission, such as Essays for our ‚ÄòFeatures‚Äô section, which should be between 5,000-7,000 words (including footnotes, excluding bibliography), Shorter articles of approximately 1,000-3,000 words (including footnotes, excluding bibliography), Book Reviews, which are typically 1,000 words (including footnotes, excluding bibliography) and Interview, with no more than 10 questions. 

Proposal abstracts should be limited to 250 words and must be accompanied by an indicative bibliography. A brief biography of the author of approx. 150 words should be provided along with the abstract. Abstracts should be sent through as Word Documents  and titled ‚ÄúFor consideration: Author First name Author Surname_Type of Submission‚Äù (e.g. For consideration: Mary Poppins_Videon Essay).

Proposals should be mailed to- chalchitradarpan@gmail.com

Abstract deadline- 25th November, 2024

"Unproduced Steven Spielberg autobiography Decades before the made The Fabelmans, in the late 1970's, Steven Spielberg wanted to do a autobiographical movie about his young adulthood in Arizona. A script was written by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale (a.k.a. The Two Bobs), who had already written 1941, which Spielberg was about to direct. But he wanted to make this movie right before that. 

So, Spielberg hired the Two Bobs to script the movie, first titled ""After School"", then ""Clearwater"", and finally ""Growing Up"". Spielberg said ""It's my first vendetta film. I'm going to get back at about twenty people I've always wanted to get back at."" 

The script that the Two Bobs had written would've been an R rated comedy. Lots of swear words. Spielberg totally approved the script saying, ""I don't want to make a movie about children that's dimples or cuteness."" The movie was gonna be shot in May of 1978 with a budget of just $1.5 million dollars. 

The director of photography was gonna be Caleb Deschanel (father of Zooey and Emily), but when he read the script, he called it ""disgusting"". Apparently, that caused Spielberg to back out of the movie and not make it. 

But can you imagine if he had made it? It would've been his first true, honest to God R rated movie. What do you guys think?",normal

I fixate on a movie and watch it constantly for weeks, months, etc.

My new obessesion is Studio 666 with the Foo Fighters.

Very cheesy film, thin as hell plot, and overall bad acting.

What I like about it is the music, John Carpenter, Jeff Garlin, portraying a stereotypical record manager douchebag.

"Edward Norton‚Äôs Filmography is Insane What do you think his best role is? I think it‚Äôs gotta be American History X, but it‚Äôs very close between that and Primal Fear. He was just perfect for that role in AHX. I think he and Edward Furlong, which by the way is a huge shame what happened to him. But the whole time watching AHX I was amazed at Nortons ability to pull off that character which was a very hard role to be good in for any actor in my opinion, for obvious reasons lol. After that he became lead man in many great critically acclaimed films in which a few have been considered classics. 

Norton has been nominated for Oscar‚Äôs for AHX as best actor, and Birdman and Primal Fear for best supporting actor. I believe he should have won for AHX and also Primal Fear, but unfortunately the iconic film came out the same year so Roberto Benigni won in 1999. In 1997 Cuba Gooding won best supporting and 2014 JK Simmons won for Whiplash, very deservingly. 

Some other notable films Norton has been in other than American History X and Primal Fear and Birdman are F**** C*** (üòÇ), 25th hour, The Score, Kingdom of Heaven, Red Dragon, Rounders, The People vs Larry Flynt, The Italian Job, The Illusionist, Moonrise Kingdom, and The Grand Budapest Hotel. Absolutely unreal filmography, not as good as Leo or Brad Pitt or some others but way better than your average actor. What is your favorite Norton performance?",normal

"Rewatched 'Adaptation (2002) and it is not about screenwriting. I had watched Adaptation quite a few years back and I remember seeing florida, crocodiles and some guy hopelessly trying to write something about mundane. It was a fun watch, but I didn't know why.

Now, years later, I watched an instagram reel which showcases the monologue of Mckee to Charlie Kaufmann about life being the most interesting thing ever and if he (Charlie) think that it is just mundane things and no big revelations he should not write a movie(I will put a youtube link below if anyone'sinterested or forgot about the scene). That scene haunted me, I dont remember that scene the movie, what else was I missing, what was the movie really about? 

Then, I rewatched the movie and boy, I think I understand now what the movie really was about. The title Adaptation on the superficial sense points to Charlie's attempts to adapt the book into a movie, but on a deeper level it is the adaptation to life itself. Of how we change into something we were not, and how passions drive us to it.

In the beginning, Charlie is a firm believer of life is boring with mundane shits repeating day after day and the movies and books are all glorification of life which has no truth in it. We see later, the author of the book about orchid (Susan Orlean) has similar views about life until she meets Laroch (the guy with no front tooth). But soon enough, she admires and even be jealous of the passion of Laroch to the things he is currently doing, whether be it fishing, planting or even hunting orchids. He is not ashamed of his passions even if they are illegal or immoral in other people's eyes. This is something Susan have hard time to wrap her head around. Even though she is a very successful journalist, she is not passionate about anything, she can't be who she really is without being ashamed of herself. This shame about oneself and admiration to the other, she latches onto Laroch as a leech and follows him in his journey.

Charlie is in a similar state of mind. He is ashamed of the persona he projects into the world, his blockbusters are what he himslef would call lifeless and untrue, and he wants to be honest for once. To be honest, is to be courageous, and he lacks courage to what needs to be done. He lacks the passion to the world. He hates life. When he reads The book Susan wrote, he is captivated by something in it. He cannot pinpoint it, and he misinterprets the book as a mundane book about flowers and thats what makes it great. He wants to make a movie about flowers being great, but he himself doesn't believe it. So what exactly is he seeking? What is hooking him to this book?

We see Laroch is a pretty smart guy who is really good at what he's doing. But his passions have changed a lot in the years and he never looked back. He is not doing anything for fame or money, but to the thrill of doing something he really cares about. What Susan, and Charlie through her seeking is, how to be passionate about something without being ashamed of the passion. That is what draws Susan to Leroch, Charlie to the book, and us the audience to the movie without us being aware of it.

Orchids are fascinating. Each species has a specific morphology which resembles a specific animal and they make love to each other. And when the bee makes love to two of these orchids, they get pollinated. The orchid or the bee does not have the ability to comprehend their actions on a grander scale. Whay they do is just following their passion and the that keeps the world going, without them knowing it. We are all orchids. And bees. Whatever we do, we dont know its significance. We are not passionate about anything because we will(will as in Will) it, but because we have no choice. We are destined to live however the way we live. And the world will rotate.

We do not make the change, we are changed when it is time to. It is not a willful choice, but an inevitability. The movie says, not to worry about being unable to change, being unable to chase your passions or being unable to be honest or courageous. Whatever you chase, even if you know it consciously or not, will be the road you'll be taking. You are seeking your orchids always.

I know this write up came up as mumbo jumbo in the screen. It was clear in mind though. I have not done justice to the movie. If you haven't watched the movie or if you forgot what the movie was about, do give it another shot. Its a fantastic one.

"Favorite action sequences that are light on special effects? One of my favorite action sequences is car chase from the movie Ronin. I am not learned enough to know if there are fancy special effects being used but from the look of it, they seem minimal. And that is what I really like about it. It goes on for a long time and it feels real. The sound of the engine, the shots from the distance, the actors' reaction shots, and of course the European locations, all combine to create a sense of this not being your typical Hollywood big budget movie. 

Most of you have probably seen the film or at least the chase scene but I'm including a link to it below for those who havn't.

There are a plenty of actors above 40 (more around 50 or older) that can't only play well their type but also all around it, DiCaprio, Oldman, Bale, Damon, Pitt etc being some example. If that's a matter of taste for you, I'm pretty sure you'll find a few more. 

Quite a few of them have started reaching this level of versatility before they were 40, and I have recently wondered if we have any of the new examples nowadays. This was triggered by finally watching the lighthouse and appreciating the effort by Robert Pattinson. Yet, I had a feeling that he mostly plays in type, being handsome and somewhat neurotic guy.

"Tea Time: Anyone want to talk about Anora? I just watched *Anora*, and there are some aspects I really liked, but thinking back on it, I have a thousand questions (warning: lots of spoilers ahead, sorry!).

First, the positives  
Mikey Madison‚Äôs performance as Anora is magnetic. She completely commands the scenes, standing out in a setting where culturally, we‚Äôre used to seeing her type of character as submissive or a victim.

But then‚Ä¶ the inevitable ‚Äúdream of marriage‚Äù  
About 30 minutes in, we realize that Anora‚Äôs ultimate dream is still, well, love. From the start of her relationship, it‚Äôs clear she‚Äôs starting to get attached. This brings us back to a kind of predictable storyline in the end.

Hints of *Parasite* and *Triangle of Sadness*, a bit predictable too  
Another thing that left me puzzled was the very (too?) obvious influence of recent films like *Parasite* and *Triangle of Sadness*. The film uses certain scenes to highlight the social divide, with a whole ‚Äúarmy of underlings‚Äù serving a detestable, spoiled teenager. The vomit scene, for example, feels almost like a copy-paste from *Triangle of Sadness* without bringing anything new to it. It loses impact and almost seems like a convenient excuse to highlight money, sex, and drugs.

And finally, my last point‚Äîwhy is the director trying to make us like Igor??  
One of the aspects that really bothered me was this attempt to make us sympathize with Igor. In the theater, people were laughing during scenes where Anora is mistreated, and I don‚Äôt really understand what the director was trying to convey here. I found it strange that we‚Äôre invited to feel empathy for Igor, as if the message is, ‚ÄúOkay, he‚Äôs violent at first, but deep down he‚Äôs a good guy.‚Äù The message seemed questionable to me.

Any thoughts on the film?",normal

"What is the explanation for this in Annihilation? Since Lena watched the video of Kane killing himself with the clone of him remaining and being the one who actually came back, why did she go back and treat the clone as if it's the real Kane and everything is normal? 

My only guess is that either she doesn't remember seeing the video or that it doesn't actually matter because they're the same and she doesn't care. I've seen people say that both of them are clones, but it's explicitly made clear that the real Lena went back, so that's not it.",normal
"""All About Eve"": What is your view on the film and its morally ambiguous protagonist? I think the tragedy about Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) is that she didn't need to lie, to manipulate, to create discord, if her main goal was to become a serious actress, because she had the talent for it. If only she believed in her worth, maybe it would have prevented her from screwing everyone around her. 

When Eve talks about the meaning of Theater for her, you're moved by her passion. That's one of the few qualities she does have and even that she messes up when, by the end, she's about to go to Hollywood. In essence, Eve is self-destructive, always ruining her chances at happiness and remaining unfulfilled. Staying married to Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) is bad enough. 

Margo Channing (Bette Davis) started out as insecure and paranoid about getting old but by the end, she overcame that. She's satisfied, staying married to Bill (Gary Merrill). Eve doesn't have a Bill of her own to keep her grounded.",normal

"Never read the book oops - Dune review ""Desert power.""



Dune review

Fair warning, this is a rewatch. When I first watched the movie with a friend, I thought of it as a beautiful, visually immersive experience that I felt would be much better experienced If i knew more about the book. And that was sadly, all I thought about it at that moment.



Whenever a movie starts with a Part One in it's title, I get a hesitation. And Dune's only covering one half of the FIRST book. This was going to be slow, this was going to have a lot of filler, this was going to have information and scenes that are not at any point integral to the main story and it won't be very pretty because they would save most of the budget for the second film. These were my initial thoughts when I set down to watch it again, having long forgotten most of the plot of the movie from before.

Dune was nothing like that. Dune is probably the best science-fiction movie I have seen this year. It is beautiful first of all, the movie somehow manages to balance shots of nature and shots of sci-fi tech and really mixes them well together to create a very immersive setting. I was in awe when Paul walks away from the beach with a ship in the background rising from the water.



It's also a really fucking compelling movie. Even though this is all serious hard science fiction stuff, there is no point in the movie where you feel lost or confused. It just works and you immediately know what each character thinks and feels. The transition from the novel to film feels very smooth in that regard though I have never read the book haha

Dune sounds really cool too, the soundtrack has this rhythmic thumping to it that just sounds so good and the soundtrack is appropiately quite, kicking in only at intense moments. The ships sound cool as hell

This is a pretty long movie, probably the longest I have seen in a while at 2h 35m but I wasn't bored for a single second because it has a very engaging pace and you get treated to a piece of lore or a beautiful shot of landscape in-between some really exciting fight and action sequences.



Overall, I would give this movie a highly recommended even if you have never seen a science movie 9/10



P/S: What's with the fight scenes? They were the only distracting bits to me and why I don't give it a perfect score. They just feel....forcefully quiet.",normal
"Discussion of Carol (2015): My Favorite Movie of All Time Flung Out of Space I recently rewatched Carol for the first time in a year and I fell head over heels in love with again as I always do. The yearning, the gazes, the danger, and the unspoken words that the air seems to vibrate with make this the most romantic movie I have ever seen.

I had a couple of topics I wanted to bring up to open up a dialogue on what a couple of the lines in the movie mean to you all. (WARNING: spoilers ahead - but if you still haven't seen the movie what are you doing?!)

First, when Carol says ""what a strange girl you are. Flung out of space"" when they first meet over lunch and then again in the middle of the first time her and Therese make their relationship relationship - what do you think that means/what does that line mean to you?

Additionally, when Therese calls Carol on the phone and says ""I want to ask you things but I'm not sure you'd want that"" and Carol says ""ask me things, please."" Why do you think she says that?

Finally, the letter Carol writes Therese when she leaves her to head back to New York to attempt play by Harge's rules to get Rindy back after the tape of her sex with Therese is sent by the private investigator.

*Dearest,*

*There are no accidents, and he would have found us one way or another. Everything comes full circle. Be grateful it was sooner rather than later.*

*You'll think it harsh of me to say so, but no explanation I offer will satisfy you. Please don't be angry when I tell you that you seek resolutions and explanations because you are young. But you will understand this one day. And when it happens, I want you to imagine me there to greet you. Our lives stretched out ahead of us, a perpetual sunrise.*

*But until then, there must be no contact between us. I have much to do, and you, my darling, even more. Please believe that I would do anything to see you happy.*

*So, I do the only thing I can.*

*I release you.*

What does that letter mean?

These are the movies and timelines I wished were made and Hollywood could stop messing up.


1) terminator. By lord my favourite franchise and I enjoyed T1 and 2 but why so many alt timelines and reboots? Just move it forward I wish we got the proper Kyle Reece dream future war scenes and the final battle to defeat Skynet. I am still waiting for it and keen to see that play out. Then I also kinda felt the salvation story angle, the 2 comic novels were also interesting to follow it. For sure don't think it is as bad as so manyade it to be. I felt the dark fate timeline is terrible and ruins everything that the franchise stood for.



2) the DC darkseid timeline. I liked man of steel and the directors cut of justice league. Sure all the DC hero movies were not as good but I was invested in that timeline and ready to see the fight against the big bad.

The one I was just watching was for Cameron‚Äôs The Abyss. No way would I have gotten through that flick as a crew member or actor.  And another Coppola picture Bram Stoker‚Äôs Dracula had a fascinating look at both the effects they used and what happens when an actor and director butt heads.

"Dissapointed with Mulholland drive This includes Spoilers!

Mulholland drive has been one of those movies I just havent come around watching but always wanted due to the high ratings. But I cant deny what a drag this movie is.

The last third of the movie doesnt justify the first two thirds.
There are reasons why the dream sequence are shot the way they are but that doesnt make them better, especially for a first time watch.
The dream part looks like a your generic 90s tv series, the disgusting bloom, the generic acting and barely anything is happening. It really feels like Im watching a lame amateur sunday afternoon drama shot for tv. I know its mostly deliberate but the last part cant just magically make me enjoy the first two thirds of the movie, because its just is what it is. 
The majority of the movie cant stand on its own legs and entirely relies on the last part. 

I think the concept is cool but the execution is just bad.",normal

"The Incredibles is the Best Disney and Pixar film of all time! I just realized, not only is today, the day of the Presidential election, but is also the Anniversary of the 2004 film...Disney and Pixar's The Incredibles. Not only the Best Pixar film ever made, but also the Best Disney movie ever made, and the Best Superhero/Comicbook movie ever made (well, okay, it wasn't based on a pre-existing comic, but you get what I mean).

Yeah, I think it's that good, I used to rewatch this film so much when I was a kid. The film has the perfect balance of tones, it can be action packed and exciting, comedic and fun, but it also be very dark and emotional and dramatic, the Dramatic aspects landing especially well. The animation surprisingly well. This film is 20 years old and it looks better then some animated films released today, and Michael Giccahino's musical score and Brad Bird amazing direction help in that ten fold.

While one could argue the film is just the ""Bob Parr Show"" I think it still does a great job at developing the other characters, including the other members of the family, but yeah, Bob's characterization and arc in this movie is still very great as well, in fact, it's kindof why I was hoping for a while Brad Bird would do MCU Spider-Man 4, as I feel The Incredibles, mainly Bob's arc, proved he would've done Peter's arc in that film in strodes, and the film follows the three act structure perfectly and beautifully. Don't even get me started on how awesome of a villain Syndrome is. Or how surprisingly dark and heavy the film can get, or how quotable the film is.

This is not just my favorite Superhero movie of all time, and deserves all the love it can get, but is also Disney and Pixar's Best film is general. As well as Brad Bird's best film in general.",normal

1. **Harry Potter**.
   1. Does Harry owe the Dursleys a debt of gratitude?
   2. (about Snape)>!Was Snape murdering Dumbledore justified?!<
2. **Star Wars**. Did Darth Vader truly redeem himself?
3. **Good Will Hunting**. Does Will have a moral obligation to use his genius?
4. **Lord of the Rings**. (It's about the end)>!Was Frodo's failure a moral failure?!<
5. **Robin Hood**. Can you steal from the rich to give to the poor?
6. **Saving Private Ryan**. The morality of the mission (which itself is mentioned in the film).
7. **The Matrix**. Blue pill v. red pill - is there a right choice between a difficult reality and a comfortable illusion?

"Recommend movie similar to viral TikTok/reddit lamp story  Story pasted below if not familiar *not my story*

My last semester at a certain college I was assulted by a football player for walking where he was trying to drive (note he was 325lbs | was 120lbs), while unconscious on the ground I lived a different life.
I met a wonderful young lady, she made my heart skip and my face red, I pursued her for months and dispatched a few jerk boyfriends before I finally won her over, after two years we got married and almost immediately she bore me a daughter.
Thad a great job and my wife didn't have to work outside of the house, when my daughter was two she [my wife] bore me a son. My son was the joy of my life, I would walk into his room every morning before I left for work and doted on him and my daughter.
One day while sitting on the couch I noticed that the perspective of the lamp was odd, like inverted. It was still in 3D but... just.. wrong. (It was a square lamp base, red with gold trim on 4 legs and a white square shade).
I was transfixed, I couldn't look away from it. I stayed up all night staring at it, the next morning I didn't go to work, something was just not right about that lamp.
I stopped eating, I left the couch only to use the bathroom at first, soon I stopped that too as I wasn't eating or drinking. I stared at the fucking lamp for 3 days before my wife got really worried, she had someone come and try to talk to me, by this time my cognizance was breaking up and my wife was freaking out. She took the kids to her mother's house just before I had my epiphany.... the lamp is not real.... the house is not real, my wife, my kids... none of that is real... the last 10 years of my life are not fucking real!
The lamp started to grow wider and deeper, it was still inverted dimensions, it took up my entire perspecti and all I could see was red, I heard voices, screams, .... kinds of weird noises and I became aware of pain.... a fucking shit ton of pain... the first words I said were ""I'm missing teeth"" and opened my eyes. I was laying on my back on the sidewalk surrounded by people that I didn't know, lots were freaking out, I was completely confused.
at some point a cop scooped me up, dragged/walked me across the sidewalk and grass and threw me face down in the back of a cop car, I was still confused.
I was taken to the hospital by the cop (seems he didn't want to wait for the ambulance to arrive) and give CT scans and shit..
I went through about 3 years of horrid depression, I was grieving the loss of my wife and children and dealing with the knowledge that they never existed, I was scared that I was going insane as I would cry myself to sleep hoping I would see her in my dreams. I never have, but sometimes I see my son, usually just a glimpse out of my peripheral vision, he is perpetually 5 years old and I can never hear what he says.",normal

"Discussion: Top 10 1990's movies A lot of movies I have watched recently are from the 1990s. I have always found this era to be the my favourite decade for cinema (and arguably one of the best alongside the 1970s). The 90s saw countless great releases as we entered further into a new age of digital, writing, effects, acting, etc.

6. Fight Club
7. La Haine

"I watched Longlegs, Late Night With The Devil, and The Witch this spooky season. The Witch‚Äôs version of Satan is still my absolute favorite. As the title says. The wife and I watched a bunch of newer horror movies for spooky season, and we noticed the devil was a real force in many of them, including Longlegs and Late Night With The Devil.

Longlegs and Late Night With The Devil just ended up being ok to me. Both started out amazing. The leads were great, the premises were great, and the first 30 or so minutes had me hooked. But as both revealed the stories and introduced the devil as kind‚Äôve this overbearing force in the movie, I just couldn‚Äôt get into them. 

The Witch‚Äôs (Robert Eggers) portrayal of Satan, embodying Black Phillip but not revealing himself until the damage had already been done by the families own sins (the father‚Äôs pride, the mother‚Äôs envy, Caleb‚Äôs lust, etc) and the actual witch in the movie, is still my all time favorite. Thomason agrees to sell her soul and join the witches at the end because she lost everything due to her family‚Äôs innate human weakness and their acquiescence to their sinful nature. But..it‚Äôs only when she has nothing left that the Devil appears, offering ‚Äúrespite‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm not religious in the least, but I went to church until I was around 10-11, so pretty formative years. My church was heavy on fearing The Devil as a real force/entity. But not like these other two movies portrayed him, where the Devil is literally a force inside these dolls that hypnotize you into killing your family (really, Longlegs?) or a demon embodying a young girl and doing typical Exorcist shit (Late Night). 

My church‚Äôs message was more about constantly being aware of more subtle influences. That feeling of wanting to ‚Äúsin‚Äù because there‚Äôs some sense of selfish pleasure you‚Äôre seeking? *That‚Äôs* the devil‚Äôs influence. Letting drugs fuck your life up physically isn‚Äôt the devils work‚Ä¶he completed his job when you were propositioned and instead of saying no like you were taught to, like you know is ‚Äúright‚Äù to‚Ä¶that ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the worst that could happen? It‚Äôll probably be fun!‚Äù is Satan whispering from your shoulder. He‚Äôs fucking with your human weaknesses (as they saw, obviously this shit is insane lol). He‚Äôs not this force of evil that‚Äôs going to force your hand; he‚Äôs going to guide you to going through what you were already wanting to do. Your own earthly sins, your own human flaws are going to drive you into what he wants, not him forcing you or taking your body over like a demon. Your own destruction is within you, and these things that you‚Äôre told are wrong that feel pleasurable? Yeah, they‚Äôre designed to destroy you. 

Which is why when, in The Witch, when he is whispering in that calming, ethereal voice ‚ÄúWouldst thou like the taste of butter? Wouldst thou like to wear a pretty dress? Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?‚Äù, it gave me goosebumps the first time I watched the movie. I dunno that I ever feared the devil when I was little, I never really bought into religion, but if I did, this is kindve how I would‚Äôve believed he could be. Not terrifying‚Ä¶but intoxicating. Not forcing me to sin and corrupt my stupid mortal soul, but subtly encouraging me to do what I already wanted to do. One final push.

That‚Äôs why I love when Thomason says she can‚Äôt sign her name over to him, he says ‚ÄúI will guide thy hand.‚Äù

"My Old Ass (2024) missed the greatest opportunity ever to pair up Jenna Ortega and Aubrey Plaza I'm probably not the only one to have thought about this. I still wanted to make a post though...

So My Old Ass stars Maisy Stella and Aubrey Plaza as the younger and older versions of the same person. The description reads: ""An 18th-birthday mushroom trip brings Elliott face-to-face with her wisecracking 39-year-old self"". So the younger and older versions have scenes together, the two actors are playing against each other all the time.

So already; what a legendary pairing this could have been for Jenna and Aubrey! There are plenty of memes on the internet about how they both kinda look alike and can play very similar characters. What caused the whole idea was most likely the similarly deadpan, creepy, but loveable characters of Aubrey's in Parks and Rec and Jenna's in Wednesday.

And on top of that, the director, Megan Park's previous movie, The Fallout (2021) even starred Jenna Ortega. I genuenly wouldn't be surprised if Park had thought up the idea for this movie back then with Jenna and Aubrey in mind for these parts, but in the end Jenna couldn't make it for some reason. But maybe I'm totally wrong there. It's a pretty fun coincidence, still.

"Why is the Godfather Part II considered so great? I don‚Äôt get it, and I really want to get it   PLEASE, Help me like the Godfather Part II

I‚Äôm only 18, which might add to the problem, idk. I found out that a cinema near me was going to screen the Godfather part II in 4k. I had never seen any one of the 3 movies, but I didn‚Äôt want to pass this opportunity up, so I watched the first one at home and went to the second one today. The first one was great, really great (except I didn‚Äôt get the purpose of Mike‚Äôs story in Italy since they never mention it again ever), but the second one left me kinda disappointed? I always knew Part II was considered like one of the greatest movies of all time, but to me the biggest problem (that was also in part 1 but it wasn‚Äôt as bad) was the name dropping (for lack of a better term). They just kept saying names of people, only for them to show up on the screen without anything telling me ‚Äúthis is X guy who they were talking about before‚Äù. I‚Äôm ashamed to admit it took me until the hearing scene to realise Frankie and Pentangeli were the same person‚Ä¶ 

The name dropping combined with Mike looking for who tried to kill him gave birth to a sequence of scenes where they just talked about people that I didn‚Äôt know, and that I didn‚Äôt connect to the names when they showed up. It got so bad (and honestly just boring, since I wasn‚Äôt getting anything that was going on) that I fell asleep for 1-2minutes a few times and this only happens to me when I‚Äôm watching a BAD movie, like a REALLY BAD one.

Since, as I said, it‚Äôs considered one of the staples of cinema, I‚Äôd like to try again (was thinking Friday), but I need to know is h to us some kind of common issue? Cuz at one point I started wondering if I‚Äôm just stupid. also, who was the one that ordered the killing of Mike? Was it left dubious on purpose? WHY did Frankie not talk when he saw his brother, did they explain this in any way? I have so many questions and it‚Äôs bothering me. Is there anything I can do to understand everything on my second watch, so that I can hopefully see what everyone else sees in this movie? Please, help me

"Possession (1981): Why did Mark‚Ä¶? Possession (1981): Why did Mark go against the cops?

I watched Possession today and loved it, but I can‚Äôt lie and say I was left a little baffled by lack of cohesion pretty much from Heinrich‚Äôs death onward (even if I continued to enjoy). I think I get the rest of it, but I‚Äôm still just so confused;

What made Mark crash the taxi, let the driver die, and shoot at the cops? 

Seems almost like a suicide, but then he doesn‚Äôt want to die. His other actions seem motivated by jealousy and desperate attempts at getting his Anna back, but this doesn‚Äôt seem to benefit anybody in any way, and I don‚Äôt understand what it represents narratively. 

Is it simply the director taking his anger out on governmental figures like in Poland? Or something I‚Äôm not realizing? I think it‚Äôs right in front of my face I just need it put into words for me to understand it firmly. Thank you to anyone who has sees this!",normal
"Westworld 1973 I've been wondering this for ages I recently watched this again after watching the HBO series and a couple of things I was wondering.

So who actually built them if nobody working with them knows how they work?

"Do I deserve love knowing I am what I am? - Bones & All review ‚ÄúThe world of love had no place for monsters in it.‚Äù

Bones & All review

This is the second Luca Guadagnino movie I have seen and I watched it right after Challengers. I enjoyed Bones & All more.

>!&#x200B;!<Probably because the director manages to create this post-apocalyptic feeling based around the fact that these cannibals just avoid people as much as they can, their time is spent isolated, most of that isolation is spent in running away from connection, from society and Luca Guadaningo builds the movie‚Äôs theme around this loneliness. He creates beauty among the empty abandoned houses that eaters use, he creates style in them by clothing them with vibrant or more grounded colors, he makes us listen to them by giving them specific musical connections. Maren the main protagonist has this single guitar string that plays really loud in the silence whenever she gets closer to where she‚Äôs going. >!&#x200B;!<

It feels romantic to me because it also captures the scenic rurality of America so well. There are a lot of shots of just the skies as the two main characters drive across states, from Ohio to Kentucky to Missouri and Minnesota. The beautiful green fields, the forests, a small town here and there, s carnival it‚Äôs all there. I have never seen a more beautiful and aesthetically pleasing America as it is.

Bones & All is a moving coming-of-age tale about the innocence of age and shows the struggle with accepting who we are when nobody else does. Everything looks like a memory of an innocent age, in a contrast to ‚ÄúChallengers‚Äù, Bones & All has a softer aesthetic to it. There are no lavishly executed shots of one character in the frame to make them look like super models as in ‚ÄúChallengers‚Äù, everything just feels more natural.

The thesis of this movie as I see it is, do you deserve love and other good things even if you are so unwanted by society?

"Watched Dragged Across Concrete (2018) because I trusted the director And I was pleasantly surprised. This came up on my radar after rewatching Bone Tomahawk and Brawl in Cell Block 99, and I remember why I and I had ignored it before: Pretty much with post modern Mel Gibson is sure to be conservative edging, Fox News echo chamber nonsense (the gender comment about who is singing the songs,  the wifes ‚Äúthis is making me racist‚Äù, the movies treatment of the only black/brown characters in the film) almost turned me off in the first 30 mins but I‚Äôm not mad that I found myself locked in

The way the dialogue was delivered was interesting, slim especially had an theatre flair to it. The quick brutality of violence being paired with that. Clear villains with grey heroes to root for. It wasn‚Äôt crazy original, but I felt it was well done

And Don‚Äôt Close The Drive In, by Butch Tavares: the song is perfect for the scene it drops in. I‚Äôm a sucker for a good soundtrack and that song on its own elevated it another half a point for me ",normal

"Which other films have a Tragic story attached? (An Elephant Sitting Still) Which other Movies have a Tragic Story attached to Them or their Crew and what is it?

I watched An Elephant Sitting Still the other day, a slow (you could say, contemplative) movie about a lot of things, most of them negative, such as pain, regret, disgust, alienation, apathy.

I had heard about the hype for the film on the icheckmovies forum years ago, but the running time kept me from watching. I honestly thought it was directed by Gan Bi since he'd directed Kaili Blues which, to me, looked similar topically and visually at the time.

So anyway, turns out the director, Hu Bo, who's in my birth year, committed suicide shortly after completing the film. I would assume that parts of this movie were autobiographical and a mix of the emotions that he felt, and likely a regret that haunted his adult life.

I'm wondering if there are any other films out there that you've come across with such a tragic circumstance. They don't have to be linked to the director, it could be a screenwriter or someone else integral to the film.

I'm sure most are aware of Brandon Lee's death on set, so perhaps something not so obvious, but hey, whatever, do as you will.

Do note that An Elephant Sitting Still is not for everyone and it is 4 hours long. I would recommend trying out the aforementioned Kaili Blues or Black Coal, Thin Ice or The Wild Goose Lake and then Eureka (2000) or maybe something more fun like Blue Spring or All About Lily Chou-Chou to get you in the mood.

"Review of ""The Substance"" (2024) This is my personal opinion, pls don't hate me.

""The Substance"" is a dystopian, almost cyberpunk-esque film that commentates on aging, body dysmorphia, and self-hatred. While its themes are very relevant in today's society, I believe that the way which Fargeat (the writer & director) handled said themes was, perhaps, too obvious in its execution. With little to no nuance at all, ""The Substance"" stands as a film which focuses too much on in-the-face (literally) partial nudity and grotesque body horror. At what point does showing a close-up of Margaret Qualley's ass in a pink leotard become gratuitous? Additionally, this film handles allusions with a seeming idea that the audience is moronic. To place a badly done flashback of another scene when we are supposed to remember it at this new moment feels like an insult from the director.

Furthermore, ""The Substance"" feels like a film centered around shock factor, especially at the end. The revelation of the Russian Roulette of Elisabeth's could have been executed well if not for the over-the-top blood bath done for no real reason. Additionally, the nudity in this scene (i.e. throwing up a whole boob, wtf??) is unnecessary and feels like another ploy to add as many nipples in one film as you can. Not to mention the dancer's being nude, as well. On Live T.V.?

"Just rewatched Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind and did Joel killed a girl when he was a kid? Spoilers ahead: It's kind of hard to follow when they both are running from memory to memory and in them they can do new stuff the memory maybe didn't do, however, a flashback when as adult they are playing asphixiation with pillow kinda confirms he did really, as a kid, put a pillow to that girl, and kids being kids, I wouldn't be surprised if he killed her while playing?

Can anyone confirm or disconfirm this?

to elaborate:

the movie doesn't stop to explain everything, thats why at the end we don't get to see if the hidden memories will even start to be remembered or not, they just cut it.

Same there, he was with a pillow, and a girl, as kids and that we know it happened, and they cut it.

They were jumping on traumatizing memories, is just playing with pillows traumatizing as smashing a pidgeon with a hammer or getting caught wanking by mom I don't think so, must be he did kill her... or at least is not that impossible to arrive to that possibility?

edit:

here is the scene, skip to end minus 20~ seconds:

"Movie details you like to share: Here's mine. In Truman Show and the trees in the forest are not as messy as real forests. They appear to be planted in rows, as one would expect from an artificial world. The Truman Show is a good movie but what elevates it at times to greatness is the little details that you may not notice the first time you watch the movie. 

For instance, when he is trying to escape through the forest, something doesn't seem quite right. The trees are planted in a row. It happens about 50 minutes or so into the movie. 

Another detail is the vitamin D he is taking. This was mentioned by a friend who said this must be because the world he lives in is not real so he will need vitamin D. But I countered that many people take vitamin D even in our world so I'm not sure how telling of a detail that one is.

"Evil Dead - Balancing Horror & Comedy I'm curious how people feel about comedy in their horror films. I disliked the Evil Dead franchise for a long time because I'm one of those people who just doesn't like comedy in my horror movies. I feel like humor takes you out of what is supposed to be a moment of genuine fear and horror. Horror and Comedy to me are polar opposites, we turn to comedy when we want to escape from horrors.

The camp of the Bruce Campbell films maybe work in large part because of his charisma on screen which I like but even that has never been enough for me to enjoy them. Then I watched Evil Dead 2013 and I absolutely loved that movie. It has humor...but it's dark humor. I immediately felt a similarity to The Exorcist where some of the writing that made people uncomfortable in that film, I just found to be funny. Specifically the possession parts of it and it was the same in Evil Dead 2013. The Devil has a sick sense of humor but it's what I would expect the embodiment of evil to say and do. 

I'm sure people are torn about the Evil Dead remakes, as we are with most remakes, but I for one am enjoying Evil Dead for the first time. I'm still not on board with campy humor in horror but if they keep doing these anthology type stories for Evil Dead then I'm here for it. ",normal

"What fictional character do you think experienced the worst character assasination when being adapted for film? Basically, who was a great fully dimensional character in the book and then got adapted into something terrible?
This could be from a good or bad adaptation, it doesn't matter. I'll throw my hat in the ring first:

Mike Hanlon from IT.

Mike in the book is the only black kid in all of Derry, but he has a warm and idyllic homelife that balances it all out. He's smart and researches history in his free time, he loves his daddy with all his heart and he loves his friends even more. As an adult he's very lonely but he still remains very hopeful that one day IT will meet its demise. When Henry Bowers, his racist childhood bully meets him again in the library with a knife, Mike still has the empathy to understand Henry is mentally ill and being used as a puppet. He tries to talk to him and call the police so he can safely be returned back to the mental hospital but it obviously goes south.

In the it 2016 continuity Mike is none of those things.
Mike is legitimately a crazy person in IT chapter 2, and the film makers replaced his lovely childhood with his parents with sheep murder and fire and guns. His historian stuff is given to Ben for literally no reason, in it chapter 2 he lies to his friends repeatedly and even DRUGS BILL. He also steals native american artifacts when he probably could have to told the tribe ""hey man I know it didn't work the first time ya'll tried it but can I try it again? I have literally nothing to lose."". His confrontation with Henry in the library just culminates in him beating the crap out of him and almost dying, nothing to humanize Henry or show Mike's empathy. He doesn't even really get to do anything while everyone else goes on stupid little spirit journeys. 

Honorable mention to Stanley too, who in the book saves the losers lives at times, has a silly but strange sense of humor, and kills himself because he genuinely is so terrified of IT, movie stanley spends the whole movie bitching and complaining about everything, kills himself for ""the good of the group"", and is even describe by Richie as ""the weakest of us"". Booooo. 

I'm not gonna sit here and say everything in the IT book is fantastic, or that stephen king is fantastic at writing black characters (even stephen king admits his pitfalls there) but jesus god! This is all made even worse by the fact when the muschiettis were developing it they considered making Mike a crack addict as adult. They later go some serious and well deserved backlash for that.

So anyways, who do you think got character assinated in an adaptation?",normal

"Just re-watched The Batman (2022) It was even better the second time around!

Gotham is just soooooo grimey and corrupt. It's such a lived in city, with such a last days of the Roman empire vibes.

I think what stood out the second time of viewing is just how much Bruce Wayne/Batman has dis-associated from society and although so succinct in his mission of ""cleaning up Gotham"", he is still searching for a purposeful way of doing it.

I think a legitimate critism of Batman is that he is an ultra rich man with a lot of soft power in gotham, so it's weird that he only goes after low level criminals and doesn't fix the larger issues plaguing Gotham. This movie definitely fixes that by bridging the connection between both blue and white collar crimes, but it also fleshes out how Batman (in the 2nd year of being Batman) is still trying to figure out the best way to fix the city, it even shows him realising his approach is flawed.

The batmobile car chase is absolutely amazing. From the point of the engine revving up and the reaction of the penguin and his goons realising it's the Batman their up against literally gives me goosebumps everytime I see it.

"Inception not as good as people say? Been hearing about how good it was and just watched it now and is actually a bit disappointed.

I know a lot of people love Inception and think it's one of Christopher Nolan's best films, but l've never really understood the hype. Sure, the visuals are stunning, and the concept of dreams within dreams is interesting, but it feels like the story gets bogged down by all the exposition and complex rules. 

To me, it's almost like the movie is trying too hard to be deep, and it ends up being confusing rather than thought-provoking.

Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the characters don't have much depth, and I didn't really feel emotionally connected to any of them. Inception is cool to watch, but when it comes to movies that make you question reality, I think there are better ones out there.

Anyone else feel this way, or am I totally alone on this?

"I genuinely enjoyed Trap (2024) I decided to watch M. Night Shyamalan‚Äôs newest film, Trap, last night. Prior to watching the movie I was unaware of the plot or premise and the only info I knew was that it was M. Night‚Äôs newest film. His movies have always been hit or miss for me but I figured I‚Äôd go in with an open mind and give it a fair shake. I will try to be as spoiler free as possible while describing my thoughts on the film. 

The first act had some great suspense building as the main character begins to realize just what he is in for. Josh Hartnett was phenomenal as he balanced two different characters, one of which only the audience is aware of, through the first and second act. Shots of Hartnett that framed his face from forehead to chin was a great way to show his superb facial expressions while acting this complex character (can someone say smiling eyes). 

The premise was unique, although a little similar to classic law enforcement/criminal cat and mouse type stuff. It wasn‚Äôt overly unrealistic or fantastical and felt at least possible if not probable throughout the film (maybe except the ending). 

The third act was the weakest point of the film from a plot perspective, which has been typical for M. Night films (at least IMO) for the last decade at least. The acting on the other hand was turned up a few notches towards the end and I was loving it. The pop star wasn‚Äôt as bad of an actor as people are making her out to be and I thought she carried the emotional weight (along with Hartnett‚Äôs family) of the climax very well. 

The ending was okay, I‚Äôll admit. A little over the top and the realism for sure dropped off right before the credits, but overall I enjoyed the suspense, the premise, the acting, and the culmination. I‚Äôve read a lot of hate on this film and I think much of it is unwarranted. Curious to hear anyone else‚Äôs thoughts. ",normal

"If CIG is so expensive, why does everyone use it now a days for mundane, simple things? I often hear CIG is incredibly expensive. And since a movies budget is obviously a huge deal, why are we relying now a days so heavily on CIG, especially for such mundane and simple things?
CIG has its place no doubt, but its just the excessive unnessecary usage that bothers me.

Creating a visual appealing scene is just often times done through post processing effects, layers up on layers. Fog is most of the time just a post proccessing effect, what happened to the smoke machine? 

Animals get completely switched out with their CIG counterparts. Literally just having a simple cockroach in your movie or series just gets animated. Sure a lion attacking a human is hard to make practical but a god damn insect crawling on the ground or on a human? 

Obviously you have much more control in cig than with practical stuff but the thing is that most of the time you can see that its not ""real"" and therefore you are not creating a convincing immersfull image and atmosphere. So your creative control of how every effect is playing out becomes irrelevant, its not worth it. 

And this is not exclusive to just big budget movies. This even happens with smaller productions and series which are on a tight budget.

"Favorite movie by european country: France Hello there,

or: my dear god - that was exciting! Often, I'm able to move on to the next country on my filmic journey a bit earlier than after 24 hours, but this time: No chance. *Rare Exports* had a thrilling battle with the winner until the very end and I thought I would have to roll the dice, but in the end, the mixture of upvotes and downvotes produced a different winner: ***Mies vailla menneisyytt√§*** (engl: *The Man Without a Past*) has narrowly become the most favorite movie set in Finland according to your votes.

I would have liked it for both of them: The runner-up scored with the Christmas theme, the winner seems to have been made by *the* Finnish director. In fact, I haven't seen either of them and maybe both will end up on my watchlist. If I'm completely honest, I haven't watched any of the films that won here yet. Maybe that will change today, because when it comes to your favorite movie set in **France**, I somehow have another one in mind that could win the contest. As everytime, there are only two rules:

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment with the most upvotes (minus the given downvotes). For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

"I Really Enjoyed The Crow Remake Am I the only one who enjoyed the remake of The Crow with Bill Skarsgard?  I know it got a lot of flack, but I wonder if maybe some people dismissed it simply out of loyalty to Brandon Lee & his untimely death filming the original.

I think it's awful what happened to Brandon Lee (I remember it happening!); however, I don't think it's off-limits to make another Crow movie.  After watching it, I saw that it really wasn't much like the original AT ALL.  The premise of him coming back to life to enact vengeance after the wrongful death of him and his girlfriend was the same, but other than that, it was so so different.

I was recently looking up which is the best version of the Lord of the Rings series to buy, and something I've been struck by is how there has been no attempt to do anything better than the original Extended Edition DVD boxes, with their beautiful faux-leather cases.

Considering physical media has obviously been on the downtick (although anecdotally, a lot of my own friends have started moving back to physical over the past year or two), it seems like having more beautiful cases that would actually look nice on a shelf would be a huge selling point.

For myself (being a gamer), I've found myself oddly enamored by the Nintendo Switch game cases, but since those only house tiny SD cards, it's nothing that would really be replicable for various kinds of DVD. I also know that Blu-Ray is kind of a ""brand"" in and of itself, so they're probably hesitant to get away from using the color blue -- but *god* do those things look destined for a landfill.

I know the old black plastic cases weren't exactly exciting to look at, but I certainly prefer them over Blu Rays sitting on a shelf. In fact, I'll likely just do what my friends do and just get a case to hold all my discs in a space-efficient manner, and then just chuck the cases themselves in the trash.

I dunno, super nitpicky I know, but I wonder if this is something that genuinely bothers anyone else?",normal
"Ideas for Unhinged Double Features.  Me and a friend have gotten an opportunity to put together a weekly double feature night at a local independent theatre. Our idea is to pick movies that are wildly different in tone, genre or style but when placed next to each other recontexualize each other in interesting ways. The idea came to me last year after watching the new version of ""All's Quiet On The Western Front"" I was feeling a bit heavy after and kind of randomly put on James Gunns ""The Suicide Squad"". It was a movie that I'd seen before and knew I liked and I didn't really think about it, just figured it would like cheer me up or cool me off or whatever but the tonal switch from death at war as dramatic horror to death at war as goofy comedy was actually horrific. The whole first action scene was a completely different shocking experience which I found really interesting. 

So anyways, we've got a few ideas but I would love to hear some other opinions. Obviously one movie playing something for horror and another playing it for comedy is a reliable blueprint but I'm open to any ideas. 

So if you were tasked with picking two very different movies that best recontexualized each other in interesting ways what would you pick? ",normal
"The Big Short - can anyone explain how Ryan Gosling‚Äôs  character made money? So I love this movie. I watch it all the time.

But I could never figure out how/why Ryan Gosling‚Äôs character was convincing Mark Baum to buy the swaps.

My understanding of swaps is (in a gross oversimplification) that it‚Äôs sort of like options in that if the event occurs the buyer of the swap makes money while the seller of the swap loses money. But if it doesn‚Äôt happen then the buyer loses the cost of the swap (though more complicated because the buyer could have to pay more throughout the time).


So why was Ryan so hell bent on selling the swaps and then why did he make a fat check at the end?  What was his characters position? What happened if mark didn‚Äôt buy the swaps from him?


I hope this doesn‚Äôt break rule 12.

Edit: woah stayed off reddit for a whole two hours and came back to finally getting my answer.  He had too many swaps and was selling some to offset the risk and possible illiquidity. 

For those still confused I didn‚Äôt see a comment that said this so hopefully this helps:  Burry throughout the process kept changing the white board to reflect the decreasing value of his fund as he way paying off the premiums from the increased price (or value) of the MBS/CDOs. Investors panicked and tried pulling out (which burry stopped). Jared (Gosling) had the same problem but couldn‚Äôt keep his bosses from pulling the plug so he had to sell some of his swaps to Baum to limit his risk (and decrease the monthly premiums)",normal

"is toy story or shrek more responsible for the rise of computer animated movies? as you've all no doubt noticed, pretty much every animated movie nowadays, at least in america, is computer animated. the only animated movies that aren't tend to be based on 2D shows. over the course of the 2010s, only 4 animated movies were hand drawn. winnie the pooh, spongebob squarepants sponge out of water, my little pony the movie, and teen titans go to the movies. 3 of those 4 movies were based on 2D animated shows.

in your opinion, which film is more responsible for this? toy story or shrek?

on the one hand, toy story was the first computer animated feature length movie. as such, computer animation as we know it owes alot of it's existence to toy story. on the other hand, shrek kinda popularized it. it was super successful when it came out and was even the first movie to win the academy award for best animated feature?",normal

"What are your biggest ‚ÄúNah, that's bullshit, I don't buy it‚Äù statements from actors and filmmakers? You probably know the feeling when you hear statements from actors and roll your eyes thinking ‚ÄúNo way I'm buying this bullshit.‚Äù

Example, (Please don't turn this into a debate about vaccinations.): But when Ice Cube told Tucker Carlson that he voluntarily turned down a $9 million fee for a movie that supposedly required vaccination for filming, but he declined and said ""your health is worth more than all the money in the world"", I personally thought that was bullshit for a number of reasons. Ice Cube would never get a 9 million dollar fee for a low budget comedy. That would be four times what Keanu Reeves received for the third John Wick. Maybe with a producer's fee, but as a producer he could have averted mandatory vaccination. He could have simply worn a mask during filming, like Tom Cruise in ‚ÄúMission: Impossible‚Äù, who didn't get vaccinated but wore a mask all the time, even as the lead actor and producer. So I rather think that there were other production struggles and Cube simply cited this as a reason to present it as a courageous and bold decision that he even gave up millions ""just for his conviction. We all would've taken the huge amount of money, but not him, what a legend"". The fact that he proudly tells Tucker Carlson of all people contributes to this.

"I'm obsessed with everything having to do with movies Alright guys, I can't hold it in any longer. Especially since I have no one to turn to with a confession as strong as this one. So I'm turning to Reddit to express what it is I'm so obsessed about: Movies.

I never feel as happy or elated when I go and see a movie at a theater all by myself. Sometimes I watch 3 movies in a row (I have a membership at my local theater of course) and I admittedly have the time of my life. Embarrassingly enough, each time I receive my ticket from the employee, on my way to the theater I sometimes might do a little jump of excitement accompanied by the biggest, cheek-hurting smile I'll produce that day. A tear of two might stream down my face. If anyone saw me, which I try to ensure no one does, they might think I'm going crazy. In a way, I am.

I am crazy, absolutely crazy for movies. I want to watch every movie ever made. Of course, the greatest, most memorable moviegoing experiences have been the films that touch my heart and my imagination so strongly, that I'm crying, applauding internally, and yelling in my head ""yes! YES! YES!!!!!!!"". But I don't care if it's a good or bad romcom, action movie, noir, foreign movie, documentary, short film or horror film - I want to see them all. ALL OF THEM. To me, quantity is just as important as quality, as odd as that sounds. Why? It's in the title. I'm obsessed. I'll be going to the movies tonight. I'm excited beyond words, beyond description, beyond comprehension, beyond rationality.

The most recent movie I saw was Zemeckis's Here (2024). Did not like it.

What's the most recent film you saw and what did you think? Let me know! MOVIES FOREVER!!!!!!!!

"Doubt has got to be one of the most stressful and intense films without being an outright thriller  I saw it a few years ago. I liked it but it didn‚Äôt linger enough. I decided to rewatch it‚Ä¶ wow! Now it did. Maybe I just needed to be older but gosh the whole atmosphere just oozes tension. Every scene feels like a pin dropping. I didn‚Äôt go to a catholic school but if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like I feel bad for anyone that did. 

The cast is brilliant! Meryl Streep‚Äôs character of course starts out as the stern disciplinarian. But by the end you see she‚Äôs just as afraid and unsure as anyone. Philip Seymour Hoffman character? I had no idea if he did it or not. I want to believe he didn‚Äôt and he really convinces me. But at the same time I know there‚Äôs just no way to be sure. I honestly forgot what a versatile actor he is. Amy Adam‚Äôs plays someone really out of her depth but you feel for her. She‚Äôs really trying. And Viola Davis conveys such quiet desperation and trauma you can feel the pain coming off of her. Her whole scene speaks volumes of the horror she‚Äôs potentially witnessing or aware of, but she can‚Äôt scream or acknowledge any of it. What a hopeless situation.

Nothing big really happens. There‚Äôs no fist fight, explosion, murder, not even a true resolution. But it feels so real because that‚Äôs usually how life is. I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter if he did it or not. The point is there‚Äôs so much in life you can‚Äôt be sure of. And it‚Äôs hard on everybody.

"Plot hole in all movies set in the future There is an inherent gaping plot hole in every movie set in the future. Why don't they know about the movie?

For example, Terminator 2 is set in 1995. Nobody seems to have heard of the 1985 hit movie 'Terminator'. People never even heard the word, which is obvious when we hear how the doctors at the mental asylum discuss Sarah Connor's ""maniac delusion"".

But then, how come the police never recognized that the guy who massacred an entire police precinct in 1984 was a perfect doppelganger of that Austrian bodybuilder guy turned actor, who played in the 1987 hit movie 'Predator' and others?

Maybe 'Predator' doesn't exist either, and neither does Arnold Schwarzenegger. (Imagine a post-credits scene where Arnie is being arrested for multiple counts of murder...)

"""The Crow"" 2024 is bad (how brave, yea?).  Okay, I know that this movie is hated and if ""Borderlands"" hadn't come out, it would have been considered the worst movie of this year. But I want to take the movie apart from the comic book and movie and say that if they didn't exist, this movie would still be bad. 

In the story, Eric and his girlfriend are killed and he returns from the dead. 

Let's start with the main problem. The love line is not working. She's been given about 30 minutes here, and it would seem that in that time you can tie us to the characters. But not here. When the characters escape from the drug dispensary, the only thing they do is have sex and take drugs, and there is also a montage in the form of a music video about love. That's all. And because of this, it's funny when the characters say phrases from the category: ""Everyone will remember our great love."" You were just two addicts with a powerful libido, what kind of great love are we talking about? 

Secondly, the movie is boring. After Eric's resurrection, the film seemed to become a set of pretentious phrases for a beautiful picture. I fell asleep while watching and woke up when the characters stopped talking with pretentious speeches and the action began, and there is surprisingly little of it here. But about him later.

The third. The actors are mostly bad. Bill Skarsgard seemed to be the only one trying to play (and overplayed), the others all mind ""I'm only here for the money"", and FKA Twigs seemed to be on drugs all the time. 

Their characters turned out to be bad. They are boring, repulsive and cardboard. Here, the main characters are being strangled, they are about to die, but you don't care so much, because they didn't manage to make them pleasant for the viewer in 35 minutes. 

The main villain seemed to be taken from ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"". An old man with demonic powers who is supposed to scare, but in fact he is boring and does not cause a drop of fear.

And action scenes. The only good part of the film, because the same scene with the opera was done very well, although the rest of the action scenes looked like another version of John Wick. But there doesn't seem to be much action here, as if it barely lasts up to 20 minutes in total.

As a result, it feels like everything bad that was in the superhero movies of the 2000s was shoved here. That's all.

"White nights,one of the few books that turned into a movie correctly I recently watched White Nights and loved it. It‚Äôs such a rare example of a book that actually makes a smooth transition to film. The movie captured the emotions, atmosphere, and beauty of the original story really well. It stayed true to the book‚Äôs themes and brought the characters to life in a way that felt genuine. You can tell the filmmakers really cared about Dostoevsky‚Äôs vision and put effort into keeping the soul of the story intact.

It‚Äôs kind of rare to find adaptations like this. Sometimes, movies based on books feel rushed or off-track, losing the heart of the story in favor of flashy scenes or added drama that wasn‚Äôt needed. Some even change key characters or plot points, and the whole thing ends up feeling disconnected from what made the book special in the first place.

I just wish more adaptations were like White Nights.",normal
"""Goodfellas"" (1990): Why do you think Karen stayed with Henry after everything she went through? Deep down, I think Karen was just as bad as Henry., Yes, he was a serial cheater and a mobster and took drugs and put his and Karen's lives in danger but she knew what she was getting. She married him after he viciously beat her ex in front of her and she was turned on by it. 

And she loved the lifestyle. She had her tacky furniture, she got to wear all the latest fashions and she did love Henry, with all his faults. 

I also love that Karen made Henry's life a living hel when she found out he was cheating. A mob wife would have just criedin silence. Not Karen, she had a gun in his face. This was no Carmela Soprano. I think Henry was more scared of Karen than he was of Jimmy.",normal

"*Anora* Had So Much Potential, But Just Fell Short... Anyone Else Feel the Same? ü§î  

Hey everyone! I saw *Anora* last night, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it‚Äînot because it was amazing, but because it was *almost* amazing. I feel like it had all the right elements, but it just didn‚Äôt quite deliver. I‚Äôm curious if anyone else felt the same way?

The dialogue was realistic, which I usually love, but it wasn‚Äôt snappy enough to keep up with the already slow pace. I kept waiting for the characters to have one of those memorable, sharp exchanges, but it just dragged. And don‚Äôt even get me started on Vanya. While Anora was fleshed out beyond her job (which I thought was refreshing‚Äîno sob story, just a strong character), Vanya felt like a cardboard cutout. He had zero interesting traits, and I kept wondering why he was there.

On the bright side, the visuals and soundtrack were incredible! It was a total sensory treat‚Ä¶ until it started feeling *too* long. Some scenes just lingered without adding much, you know? And then the ending‚Ä¶ I was so ready for it to redeem itself, but Anora‚Äôs actions in that last scene were frustrating. There were so many directions they could have gone to give us something meaningful, but instead, it just‚Ä¶ fizzled.

Anyone else feel like *Anora* was packed with potential but missed its mark? I'd love to hear your thoughts!",normal

Movies like The Killer (2023)  This movie was sooooo good. I really like Finchers style of directing so I love almost all of his movies but this one really surprised me since it got very mixed reviews. But it did it get 85% on Rotten so I guess it was well received. But I just love the atmosphere of it and the narration and the pace was good and I just thought the story was very interesting and the main character was likeable. I really like crime dramas so anything about hit men is good anything that‚Äôs a thriller is good and just whatever you can think of that has similarities of any kind.

"Favorite movie by european country: Finland Hello there,

yesterday, I've asked you for the most favorite movie set in Estonia and I have to admit: I'm really surprised at how many different films were entered into the race. Accordingly, the votes were very evenly spread and even though there may have been even closer results with a lower turnout, I think it was even closer this time thanks to your strong support: the runner-up scored 15 points this time, while our winner only scored 2 more - and that despite a very high turnout: Congrats to ***Vehkleja*** (engl.: *The Fencer*).

If I've understood it correctly, the movie is set in Estonia, but by a finnish director. This leads us directly to the next country, because today we are looking for your favorite movie set in **Finland**. As everytime, there are only two rules in this game:

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

It generally feels like it's made for horror fans and by horror fans.

This movie gripped me from the start - from the two young women getting to know each other in the music school in China, to that scene on the bus.... God, the scene on the bus probably had me on edge more than most other movie scenes I've ever watched.

So why did it have to lose its momentum and go so very much downhill in the second half? Too many plot twists, I think! One is fine, two or three is too many.

Cooper fell into the black hole to transport otherwise untouchable data to earth through gravity and time. That data was used by humans to escape Earth and (in the future) build a 5D box that helps Cooper travel & communicate through gravity and time while he's stuck in the black hole.

"Film-productions that had an unintended but negative real-life outcome. Stretching a 300-page kids' book into a ten hour epic was never going end well artistically. **The Hobbit ""trilogy""** is the misbegotten followup to the classic Lord of the Rings films. Worse than the excessive padding, reliance on original characters, and poor special-effects, is what the production wrought on the New Zealand film industry. Warner Bros. wanted to move filming to someplace cheap like Romania, while Peter Jackson had the clout to keep it in NZ if he directed the project. The concession was made to simply destroy NZ's film industry by signing in a law that designates production-staff as contractors instead of employees, and with no bargaining power. Since then, elves have not been welcome in Wellington. [The whole affair is best recounted by Lindsay Ellis' excellent video essay.](https://youtu.be/uTRUQ-RKfUs)

[Danny Boyle's The Beach is the worst film ever made. ](https://youtu.be/rMHINpgFO3I)Looking back It's a fascinating time capsule of the late 90's/Y2K era. You've got Moby and All Saints on the soundtrack, internet cafes full of those bubble-shaped Macs before the rebrand, and nobody has a mobile phone. The story is about a backpacker played by Ewan, uh, Leonardo DiCaprio who joins a tribe of westerners that all hang on a cool beach on an uninhabited island off Thailand. It's paradise at first, but eventually reality will come crashing down and the secret of the cool beach will be exposed to the world. Which is what happened in real-life. The production of the film tampered with the real Ko Phi Phi Le beach to make it more paradise-like, prompting a lawsuit that dragged on over a decade. The legacy of the film pushed tourists into visiting the beach, eventually rendering it yet another cesspool until the Thailand authorities closed it in 2018. It's open today, but visits are short and strictly regulated.

Of course, there's also the old favorite that is **The Conqueror**. Casting the white cowboy John Wayne as the Mongolian warlord Genghis Khan was laughed at even in the day. What's less funny is that filming took place downwind from a nuclear test site. 90 crew members developed cancer and half of them died as a result, John Wayne among them. This was of course exacerbated by how smoking was more commonplace at the time.

Shows like Siskel and Ebert were an entertaining preview into new releases. Without shows like this I never know what's playing or worth seeing.

As I searched it online today, I came across a fellow Redditor's insightful analysis.  This part stood out:  

""... What Haneke demonstrates is that Nazis are not that special. They were children that lived through an incredibly tumultuous and painful period in German history, and as such, many grew to not have faith in anything. Their leaders, their social structure, the older generation - all failures in the eyes of the troubled, abandoned German youth. This, Haneke argues, makes people susceptible to radicalization.""

"Your Favorite Film Scores and Composers? I've recently gotten more into film scores.  It's like a pure dose of nostalgia listening to scores from some of my favorite films as a kid.  In listening to more of them lately, you can definitely pick out themes of certain composers that carry across their work.  IE - The same guy who scored Lethal Weapon, also scored Die Hard.  They literally sound the exact same at points of each film, like he just recycled some of the unused tracks from Lethal Weapon (1987) for Die Hard (1988).

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/red-one/): 37/100 (9 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.

> This holiday entry, which could almost have been called A Fast & Furious Christmas, is so ugly, artificial and overlong that it should cure kids of any belief in magic. It‚Äôs a prime example of the ways in which CG effects have impoverished the imaginations of many contemporary filmmakers ‚Äî making anything possible, but too often at the expense of a human heartbeat. In any case, Red One is the equivalent of a lump of coal in your Christmas stocking.

-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-evans-christmas-1236054244/)

> I‚Äôm not sure that a Hollywood movie has ever kicked off the season with less true Christmas spirit than ‚ÄúRed One.‚Äù Sure, J.K. Simmons plays Santa Claus (who gets abducted), and Simmons is winning in his crinkly old wise innocence. Dwayne Johnson, as Santa‚Äôs bodyguard (who wants to retire because he‚Äôs having a crisis of faith), is his outsize amiable self. The odd thing about the movie is that while it‚Äôs a little bit tongue-in-cheek, it‚Äôs not really a comedy. Directed with charmless energy by Jake Kasdan, ‚ÄúRed One‚Äù is at once an action movie; a kidnap-rescue thriller in which the doors to supply closets in toy stores are mystic portals; and an exercise in Christmas world-building, as if that‚Äôs the thing that‚Äôs been missing from Christmas.

-[Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-hemsworth-j-k-simmons-1236199619/)

> ‚ÄúRed One‚Äù will make you not only bummed about the holidays ahead, but about cinema‚Äôs future as well. Yet if you‚Äôve been paying attention (and wasting your money at multiplexes in the process), the latter‚Äôs a reality far less shattering than the dawning of Santa Claus‚Äôs own upon a hopeful child. Make it a Christmas miracle, and cross this ‚ÄúRed One‚Äù off your list.

-[Ryan Lattanzio, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-1235062639/): D

> Yes, it‚Äôs cheesy, but this movie is best when it leans heavily into the cheese. If that makes your eyes roll, keep in mind this is a Christmas movie ultimately intended for kids who‚Äôve made it all the way through the MCU on Disney+ twice and their parents now need a reprieve. There are still some jokes aimed at the cold-hearted adult who will inevitably be dragged along on the family cinema outing.

-[Glenn Garner, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/11/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-evans-1236165948/)

> The most important thing I can tell you about Jake Kasdan‚Äôs ‚ÄúRed One‚Äù is that yes, it‚Äôs a real film starring Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans as a mismatched action movie odd couple rescuing a kidnapped Santa Claus, and not a ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù parody. And it‚Äôs not nearly as awful as it sounds.

-[William Bibbiani, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-evans-christmas-movie/)

> There‚Äôs nothing wrong with a big-hearted film for Christmas, but this commercial and formulaic slice of content is a toy destined to be forgotten, not by Boxing Day, but mid-November.

-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/06/red-one-review-dwayne-johnson-chris-evans-santa-kidnapped): 1/5

> Most disappointing of all is that there‚Äôs a moment right out of the incredible scene at the start of 2010‚Äôs The Other Guys, when Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson leap off a tall building in pursuit of suspects as though their swagger will save them, only to splat on the pavement and die. In Red One, Johnson does the exact same thing unironically, diving off Santa‚Äôs tower after his captors, then swinging off other structures and finding his way into a snowmobile-chase sequence. It doesn‚Äôt look like there‚Äôs room for that kind of self-deprecation in Johnson‚Äôs career anymore.

-[Alison Willmore, Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-netflixs-red-one-will-remind-you-of-better-movies.html)

> The movie's shining light is JK Simmons as a muscly Santa who can easily do 500 press-ups in five minutes. He manages to sell the schmaltzy lines and is a great fit as Saint Nick in his second Santa movie outing following Netflix's exceptional Klaus. Unfortunately, the plot means he's off-screen after the first act and the movie suffers for it. You're also left with an overwhelming confusion over who Red One is actually aimed at. The humour is largely too juvenile for adults, but the language is also too crude for young ones. Even the villain Gr√Ωla (a wasted Kiernan Shipka, who mostly just glares at the camera) is likely too scary for the youngest viewers.

-[Ian Sandwell, Digital Spy](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a62801725/red-one-review/): 2/5

> A simpler adventure might have amplified that feel-good message, but Red One, which reportedly cost $250 million, lumbers over its two-hour runtime. The story introduces other fantastical organisations ‚Äî Liu plays the director of a group that monitors magical figures ‚Äî and even checks in on Santa‚Äôs coldhearted brother Krampus (Kristofer Hivju). The slathered-on CGI is often unsightly, and Shipka rarely gets a moment to shine. Still, Simmons makes for an endearing, unironic Santa whose passion for his job has never wavered. At its best, Red One embodies that lightness, balancing it with the overwhelming dictates of a big-budget spectacle ‚Äî but not nearly often enough. 

-[Tim Grierson, Screen Daily](https://www.screendaily.com/reviews/red-one-review/5198830.article): 2/5

> Making a truly classic Christmas movie is hard; despite a slew of new ones every year, the last crop of true classics date back to 2003. But you still have to approach them with genuine goodwill in your heart, not some focus-group scores and aspirations of a shared holiday universe. If this had just reined in the bombast and focused on the characters, it might have been something. As it is, it‚Äôs an awfully big box for such a small amount of cheer.

"The Strangers: Chapter 1 My god was it awful. My takeaways:

- Froy Gutierrez was BAD. A one-note performance.

- ‚ÄúIs Tamara here?‚Äù THREE TIMES? Was the first step in the killers‚Äô plan to just be annoying??

- Dude just borrows the beat-up motorcycle that the owner leaves the keys too but never mentions?? To ride into town to get his inhaler that he hardly ends up needing? That his gf forgot to pack? You‚Äôre an adult. That‚Äôs YOUR inhaler. It‚Äôs not her responsibility!

- BF says the GF was just high and saw a mask in the room. How fucking high was she?? It was an adult woman standing 3 feet in front of her!

- The couple just sits up against a wall and casually watch the hooded dude chop through the door. They do NOTHING. Never seen that in a horror movie.

"Favorite movie by european country: Estonia Hello there,

technically, I'm a bit early, but I think the winner of my search for your most favorite movie set in Denmark is now almost uncatchable: ***Jagten*** (engl.: *The Hunt*) wins with more than 120 upvotes (minus the given downvotes, if there were any) while the runner-up doesn't even have 100.

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.

"That's some real shit on camera - Babylon review Babylon is one of the most mediocre moments I have ever felt watching a movie by myself on my computer screen at home. And yet I would have loved to experience it in the cinemas. I would have liked to know how so many people reacted to the sheer chaos on the screen. I would have liked to see how many got teary eyed like me in the finale. I would have loved to talk to people afterwards to see if they were willing to share more about what they thought about the early days of cinema. 

I didn't think Damien Chazzelle could create an informative and telling tale about the early cinema that was R rated and ran for 3 hours long and had a stupendously roaring loud screenplay to go with it but that's exactly what he did with Babylon.

Margot Robbie plays a triumphant Harley Quinn-like character who never stops ****ING up things in her life, Diego Calva in the first movie I have ever seen him in, stands out as a capable leading man who's entertaining to watch and Brad Pitt plays a established Hollywood star who's ready to be replaced much like DiCaprio's character in Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood. 

8.5/10 an often times cartoonish attempt to capture the wild roaring essence of the well, roaring '20s that falls flat in trying to be scary and nuanced at so many turns but when it works, it's magic.

3.) He also left Dwayne, his only chance for survival and company at the time.
4.) Didn't even think of taking his rations with him or salvaging from the other pods. I wouldn't even leave my Fire Extinguisher when it was thrown out of his pod since it could be of some use.
5.) The movie portrayed Dwayne as some crazy guy when he's the one who would actually likely to survive in these type of scenarios.
6.) Bugs are pecking his suit and he's not shooing them away immediately?
7.) The spider monsters stopped chasing him and I already figured out it must be because it's a territory of another predator. But he was clueless.
8.) Why didn't he just make his way to the Borealis first to find some oxygen supply instead of risking it to Naomi immediately?!<

"My Cousin Vinny is my favorite fIsh-out-of-water movie. What is yours? You know the movie where a character is in situations where he feels lost or confused, like he doesn't belong? Like a big city lawyer finding herself in a small village where nobody practices or even cares about legal issues. Or maybe a cashier ends up having to pretend to be the CEO of the company for some crazy reason and hilarity ensues?

Okay, I like movies like that. My Cousin Vinny is a great example. It works on so many levels, but it's one of the smarter comedies out there and it's still so much fun to watch. One of my favorite scenes is quite early in the movie:

"Found Something Beautiful (and need your help) I assume that everyone who belongs to this Reddit has seen a ton of movies. I have too and sometimes I feel like I‚Äôve seen every story and trope and character. I have to say one of the most beautiful things is when you stumble upon a movie, or a group of movies of a certain genre or with a certain actor or a certain director that you‚Äôd never seen but just totally click with you. Sometimes you get in ruts where every movie seems like a reiteration of a previous one and it feels so refreshing when you find something new that feels different.

This happened with me and Albert Brooks movies. I only knew him from finding Nemo and this is 40 and can‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôve been missing. I saw broadcast news and loved that movie tremendously and specifically his character. His sense of humor and anxiety and his self deprecation just hit the sweetest spot for me and so I sought out more. I watched Defending Your Life, Modern Romance, and Real Life. Similar but different I was also recommended the Big Chill based on this interest and loved that one so much I bought the dvd right after. 

I have two questions:

1. Have you experienced this? If so what was the movie, actor, director, etc.?

2. I was born in the 90s and missed the bulk of these 80s movies and was wondering if you had any suggestions for movies similar to these Albert Brooks ones I mentioned and the big chill?

"Back to the Future (the incomplete Eric Stoltz version) It's pretty well known that Eric Stoltz was originally Marty McFly in Back to the Future. The amount of weeks he filmed seem to very from source to source. Sources have said it anywhere from five to seven weeks in total. But I think that it was actually seven weeks. That's nearly the entire movie.

They got rid of Stoltz because he played the part of Marty too seriously, too edgy, and not comedic enough. Check out Futurepedia, the BTTF Wiki. Type in the name ""Eric Stoltz"". You'll see a full list of all the scenes he filmed. I'd really like to see all that footage. It's incomplete, but it'd be like an alternate version of the movie.",normal

"My Best friend's wedding (1997) Just watched the movie for the first time qnd I wasn't around for the nineties, so I have more modern sensibilities, and i'm a bit shocked. 

Yes julianne is awful, but michael is far worse in my opinion, and he should not be getting married to Jimmy when he acts how he does. He's way too close to his best friend being honest with her complementing her half dressed body, being way too intimate with her all while he's engaged to a woman, he clearly doesn't seem to know well enough. It seems like they're still in the honeymoon stages of love, not to mention she can't even legally drink. She's 20 and he's 28. Personally, I do think this is an appropriate age gap. But that aside, he's completely okay with her giving up her career in future to follow him around in his crappy job because of his ego? And then when she tries to change your mind about this, which I understand he's upset, it's last minute, but he basically gaslights her into being submissive and complicit to him??? 
The thing that I don't get is why no one acknowledges michael as the villain? From what i've seen, everyone just seems so caught up with the fact that julianne doesn't end up with michael in the end and thinks it's subversive, but I think michael is the real villain? But I can't find any information of I guess other people agreeing. So my question is when it first came out. Did anyone else think that Michael was the villain? When rewatching it, did people feel that way? I feel like all the focus was on julianne.And michael, just kind of gets a pass for being shitty. 
I just feel like when you rewatch certain movies that you saw as a kid when you're older and you see how problematic, they can be kind of how like I used to like the movie ghosts of a girlfriend's past and then I rewatched it as an adult and was concerned. ",normal

"What is your theory on what truly happened in ""Anatomy of a Fall""? I still think the father, Samuel (Samuel Theiss), killed himself. He was self-loathing and unhappy and blamed Sandra (Sandra Huller) for how his life turned out. 

I didn't think the film indicated Sandra had enough motivation for murder. At best, they could have fought and he ended up tripping and falling, an accidental death. Sandra was self-centered and cruel, flaunting her affairs in her husband's face and destroying any self-esteem he could have by bringing up his failures at life. Still, those weren't good reasons for her to turn into a black widow. 

By the end, I did expect a possible twist, an indication she might be guilty. It never happened. Sandra is exhausted and wants to move on, forget the trauma. I liked how the film remains ambiguous, we don't get a clear answer so it's up for the viewer to decide what transpired in the chalet.",normal

"Dissapointed with Mulholland drive This includes Spoilers!

Mulholland drive has been one of those movies I just havent come around watching but always wanted due to the high ratings. But I cant deny what a drag this movie is.

The last third of the movie doesnt justify the first two thirds.
There are reasons why the dream sequence are shot the way they are but that doesnt make them better, especially for a first time watch.
The dream part looks like a your generic 90s tv series, the disgusting bloom, the generic acting and barely anything is happening. It really feels like Im watching a lame amateur sunday afternoon drama shot for tv. I know its mostly deliberate but the last part cant just magically make me enjoy the first two thirds of the movie, because its just is what it is. 
The majority of the movie cant stand on its own legs and entirely relies on the last part.

"Should the recent Halloween sequels have been based on Halloween 1 or on Halloween 1 and 2? Hi,

I am curious about your point of view. 

The recent Halloween sequels are only based on Halloween 1. All the other sequels are ignored.


However i loved Halloween 2 and would have loved that the recent sequels were based on Halloween 1 and 2. I see these movies as one movie. I actually liked that Laurie and Michael were brother and sister. And it also establishes more of that feeling that he was after her. Even after being shot 6 times he still came after her in the hospital. That really made her feel that she would never be safe wherever she goes.

What your opinion about if the Halloween sequels should have been based on Halloween 1 or on 1 and 2?

"Never read the book oops - Dune review ""Desert power.""



Dune review

Fair warning, this is a rewatch. When I first watched the movie with a friend, I thought of it as a beautiful, visually immersive experience that I felt would be much better experienced If i knew more about the book. And that was sadly, all I thought about it at that moment.



Whenever a movie starts with a Part One in it's title, I get a hesitation. And Dune's only covering one half of the FIRST book. This was going to be slow, this was going to have a lot of filler, this was going to have information and scenes that are not at any point integral to the main story and it won't be very pretty because they would save most of the budget for the second film. These were my initial thoughts when I set down to watch it again, having long forgotten most of the plot of the movie from before.

Dune was nothing like that. Dune is probably the best science-fiction movie I have seen this year. It is beautiful first of all, the movie somehow manages to balance shots of nature and shots of sci-fi tech and really mixes them well together to create a very immersive setting. I was in awe when Paul walks away from the beach with a ship in the background rising from the water.



It's also a really fucking compelling movie. Even though this is all serious hard science fiction stuff, there is no point in the movie where you feel lost or confused. It just works and you immediately know what each character thinks and feels. The transition from the novel to film feels very smooth in that regard though I have never read the book haha

Dune sounds really cool too, the soundtrack has this rhythmic thumping to it that just sounds so good and the soundtrack is appropiately quite, kicking in only at intense moments. The ships sound cool as hell

This is a pretty long movie, probably the longest I have seen in a while at 2h 35m but I wasn't bored for a single second because it has a very engaging pace and you get treated to a piece of lore or a beautiful shot of landscape in-between some really exciting fight and action sequences.



Overall, I would give this movie a highly recommended even if you have never seen a science movie 9/10



P/S: What's with the fight scenes? They were the only distracting bits to me and why I don't give it a perfect score. They just feel....forcefully quiet.",normal

"V for Vendetta (2005) - How relevant is it today One of the things I find fascinating about this film is that it's message doesn't change but how that message is interpreted seems to change depending on what generation you are in. It's obviously a very political movie and it's interesting to see how everyone on either side of the political divide watch this film and think the movie is ""on their side"".

I've heard folks who are more conservative comment on the medical experimentation, controlled language and lockdowns and say that is proof they are the films audience. Simultaneously on the other end of the political spectrum, those liberal folks look at that story of the young woman who was next to V's cell in the containment facility and think it validates their beliefs.

It's bizarre how nuanced storytelling has fallen to the wayside these days and everything needs to be polarizing because everyone wants to be validated. Ironically on both sides, they ignore the very first speech V gives at the TV station where he says ""if you're looking for someone to blame, you need only look in the mirror"". This couldn't be more true today as it was back then. He didn't fault one group of people for the state of affairs because it's everyone's responsibility to recognize when an idea has evolved into extremism, regardless of your political view. Even more ironic, is the idea that blowing up parliament was sticking it to one side or another, especially when you consider Guy Fawkes was catholic and by today's standards would be considered very conservative yet that's the mask V chose to wear. The man himself or any label attached to him was irrelevant, the idea is what was important.

We've forgotten that people are more than these labels we choose to attach to them. We've become so obsessed with putting ourselves in these categories, but labels by their definition are ""exclusive"". Anyone who doesn't fall under that label is automatically an outsider and it's gotten to the point where we've just stopped listening to each other altogether and stopped caring about each other. The opening monologue of the film underscores where we are really well...""you cannot kiss an idea, you cannot touch it or hold it...ideas don't love"". I guess we'll all have to ask ourselves whether it's worth it in the end.",normal

"Watched every Paranormal Activity movie last week. (ranking/review). Had the urge to watch every Paranormal Activity movie since I never watched 5,6,7. So I watched them all in order. Extremely fun horror movies. Id honestly say they are all close to each other besides Ghost Dimension and Next of Kin. Personally Id rank them. ( 2,1,3,4,5,7,6 ). The one thing I gathered is that they did a really good job tying the movies together.

PA 2: definitely the best and scariest all around. The most well made, ties into the first one nicely. The staircase scene is terrifying as well as the Kitchen explosion. The ending is slightly underwhelming but is fine. 

PA: The Original holds up well. gives you just enough information to make your imagination go. simple and straight to the point. Fuck Micah though. I do wish there was a few more Tobi encounters, a shadow or two. But In this franchise its just hard to beat the original. 

PA 3: Not many prequels do franchises justice but they did a great job with the story. The ending was what did it for me. I knew the grandmother was part of something when she mentioned trying to have a son to the mother. But when Julie doesn‚Äôt return and Denis slowly starts to find out about the Occult the movie switches a gear. 

PA 4: Is the middle ground. The marked ones and 4 are interchangeable. Theres nothing ground breaking about 4 but theres nothing bad about it either. Realizing Katie is the mother was a jump scare. And again the ending was intense. 

The Marked ones: I loved it. It was refreshing to get away from Katie at least relatively. I know I keep talking about the endings but this ending was WILD. Not only the shotgun scene and the Grandmothers ranch, but going through the portal door to tie into the first movie was insane! Id put this movie higher but I just thought the other movies before it were a little better. 

Next of Kin: ill just start by saying this would be a better movie if it wasnt part of the Paranormal franchise. It was a great Found Footage film. but just not a great addition to the franchise. Beautiful cinematography. Some really good ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moments. Finding the computer closet, and the conversation with the mailman. My biggest gripe is that The movie broke away from being Found Footage twice and I just couldnt look past it. 

Ghost Dimension: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶felt like a direct to DVD movie. The CGI was terrible and distracting. The monster reveal was extremely underwhelming. I wanted Tobi to be more demonic paimon looking. Some concepts were cool. The part where they find out they were set up and lured to buy that house was scary. When they realized the real estate agent was part of the cult made me say ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù.

"Bob Roberts - More people should see this movie during elections!  This is a great Tim Robbins movie about the campaign of a slimy, deceptive right wing candidate for the Senate. It has some real acting depth (Tim Robbins, Giancarlo Esposito, Gore Vidal, Alan Rickman and many others - even a turn by a young Jack Black). It even includes an attempted assassination that the candidate milks for sympathy. In the movie, Roberts is a folk singer who sings songs on the campaign trail, but the songs are all right-wing oriented. Rumor has it in real life that Robbins refused to release the soundtrack independently lest it be used for right-wing purposes in real life. Although the movie is over 30 years old, it speaks to the soullessness of politics in a way that is still very relatable.",normal

Mikey Madison‚Äôs performance as Anora is magnetic. She completely commands the scenes, standing out in a setting where culturally, we‚Äôre used to seeing her type of character as submissive or a victim.

But then‚Ä¶ the inevitable ‚Äúdream of marriage‚Äù  
About 30 minutes in, we realize that Anora‚Äôs ultimate dream is still, well, love. From the start of her relationship, it‚Äôs clear she‚Äôs starting to get attached. This brings us back to a kind of predictable storyline in the end.

Hints of *Parasite* and *Triangle of Sadness*, a bit predictable too  
Another thing that left me puzzled was the very (too?) obvious influence of recent films like *Parasite* and *Triangle of Sadness*. The film uses certain scenes to highlight the social divide, with a whole ‚Äúarmy of underlings‚Äù serving a detestable, spoiled teenager. The vomit scene, for example, feels almost like a copy-paste from *Triangle of Sadness* without bringing anything new to it. It loses impact and almost seems like a convenient excuse to highlight money, sex, and drugs.

And finally, my last point‚Äîwhy is the director trying to make us like Igor??  
One of the aspects that really bothered me was this attempt to make us sympathize with Igor. In the theater, people were laughing during scenes where Anora is mistreated, and I don‚Äôt really understand what the director was trying to convey here. I found it strange that we‚Äôre invited to feel empathy for Igor, as if the message is, ‚ÄúOkay, he‚Äôs violent at first, but deep down he‚Äôs a good guy.‚Äù The message seemed questionable to me.

Any thoughts on the film?",normal

"The Incredibles is the Best Disney and Pixar film of all time! I just realized, not only is today, the day of the Presidential election, but is also the Anniversary of the 2004 film...Disney and Pixar's The Incredibles. Not only the Best Pixar film ever made, but also the Best Disney movie ever made, and the Best Superhero/Comicbook movie ever made (well, okay, it wasn't based on a pre-existing comic, but you get what I mean).

Yeah, I think it's that good, I used to rewatch this film so much when I was a kid. The film has the perfect balance of tones, it can be action packed and exciting, comedic and fun, but it also be very dark and emotional and dramatic, the Dramatic aspects landing especially well. The animation surprisingly well. This film is 20 years old and it looks better then some animated films released today, and Michael Giccahino's musical score and Brad Bird amazing direction help in that ten fold.

While one could argue the film is just the ""Bob Parr Show"" I think it still does a great job at developing the other characters, including the other members of the family, but yeah, Bob's characterization and arc in this movie is still very great as well, in fact, it's kindof why I was hoping for a while Brad Bird would do MCU Spider-Man 4, as I feel The Incredibles, mainly Bob's arc, proved he would've done Peter's arc in that film in strodes, and the film follows the three act structure perfectly and beautifully. Don't even get me started on how awesome of a villain Syndrome is. Or how surprisingly dark and heavy the film can get, or how quotable the film is.

This is not just my favorite Superhero movie of all time, and deserves all the love it can get, but is also Disney and Pixar's Best film is general. As well as Brad Bird's best film in general.",normal

"Favorite action sequences that are light on special effects? One of my favorite action sequences is car chase from the movie Ronin. I am not learned enough to know if there are fancy special effects being used but from the look of it, they seem minimal. And that is what I really like about it. It goes on for a long time and it feels real. The sound of the engine, the shots from the distance, the actors' reaction shots, and of course the European locations, all combine to create a sense of this not being your typical Hollywood big budget movie. 

Most of you have probably seen the film or at least the chase scene but I'm including a link to it below for those who havn't.

"Chalchitra Darpan : Call for Papers Greetings,

Chalchitra Darpan is an undergraduate film journal by Celluloid, the Film Society of Miranda House, University of Delhi. As Delhi University‚Äôs only undergraduate film journal, the inaugural edition (2019-20) was introduced with the vision of building a student community of future film scholars around it. The journal aims to provide an academic space for undergraduates interested in film and media, who wish to explore and engage in film academia. 

The fourth edition of Chalchitra Darpan (2023-24), is in now in the making with the theme : ‚ÄòDo Films Lie?‚Äô

It is an attempt to probe and explore the portrayal of truth in cinematic storytelling, the degree to which narratives can be framed and de-framed to reveal the film‚Äôs perception of truth. The issue of the invocation of creative liberty is to be weighed against distortions of reality. There is philosophical scope herein to even examine the inherent value attributed to truth (the debatability of its existence) and realism. We may refer to the origin of dramatic irony in Sophocles‚Äô Oedipus Rex wherein the audience and the characters are privy to different levels of information which brings forth the question of the existence of different perceptions of the same narrative. Besides the propagation of ‚Äúpropaganda‚Äù films such as Triumph of the Will (1935) which employ grandiose visuals and stirring speeches to create a glorified image of the Nazi regime, there is also the credibility of the category of documentaries and the matter of truth in literary cinematic adaptations, the question of ‚ÄòDo Films Lie‚Äô leaves ample room for contemplation. 

Chalchitra Darpan accepts a variety of written pieces for submission, such as Essays for our ‚ÄòFeatures‚Äô section, which should be between 5,000-7,000 words (including footnotes, excluding bibliography), Shorter articles of approximately 1,000-3,000 words (including footnotes, excluding bibliography), Book Reviews, which are typically 1,000 words (including footnotes, excluding bibliography) and Interview, with no more than 10 questions. 

Proposal abstracts should be limited to 250 words and must be accompanied by an indicative bibliography. A brief biography of the author of approx. 150 words should be provided along with the abstract. Abstracts should be sent through as Word Documents  and titled ‚ÄúFor consideration: Author First name Author Surname_Type of Submission‚Äù (e.g. For consideration: Mary Poppins_Videon Essay).

Proposals should be mailed to- chalchitradarpan@gmail.com

Abstract deadline- 25th November, 2024

"What cave movie did I watch in the 2000s There was a movie (very well done, very high quality) about a team of cave explorers who find a cave with an underwater entrance. There are no monsters in it, but most of them end up going crazy from being in a dark confined space with no way out and either killing each other or themselves or die because the cave is just a treacherous place to be. At the beginning it shows a very real depiction of drowning, and by the end it has the final character who survives holding her breath and appearing on a beach where a couple is like ‚Äúwhere the heck did this girl even come from?‚Äù It was pretty dark, but that was because it was realistic tbh.

"I like Stuio 666 and I'll tell you why I think I have OCD when it comes to movies.
I fixate on a movie and watch it constantly for weeks, months, etc.

My new obessesion is Studio 666 with the Foo Fighters.

Very cheesy film, thin as hell plot, and overall bad acting.

What I like about it is the music, John Carpenter, Jeff Garlin, portraying a stereotypical record manager douchebag. 

I'm also ofcourse happy to see Taylor Hawkins , pretty much right before he died.

Pat Smears , for some weird reason, intrigues me in the movie.

The Pearl Jam high five is an amusing addition.

Watched the last voyage of the Demeter last night  The movie was quite suspenseful and never had a boring moment.

Currently I'm trying to analyze them by myself, but

"My feelings on the Uglies movie, as someone who read the books multiple times as a teen and just reread them last week I am so disappointed because this series of books is excellent. It was hugely impact full on me as a teen, and I loved them so many times I read them over and over. 

When I saw that the movie had finally come out, I decided to reread them. I have been waiting for this movie for over 15 years. 

I know that highly anticipated media often struggles to meet expectation, but this is just.. *sigh*

1. The brutality sci-fi architecture. While not explicitly explained in the books, I felt it to be too sterile in uglyville. This is a minor complaint. 

2. The introduction of Shay feels.. bad. Wrong? She was never mean to Tally like that in the books. Yes, uglies buly each other but it's not ao mean. 

3. Tally and Peris never had a romance thing between them. Ever. Peris was always only a friend. I have no idea why this seemed to be a storyline at all. Why? Pointless change. 

4. Introducing Dr. Cable as governor of the city + Laverne Cox casting: full miss. Dr Cable is not the governor of the city. This is, again, a needless deviation that doesn't add anything to the movie. 

I like Laverne Cox as an actor, she was great in OITNB and incredibly dynamic. However, she was a huge miss for me on this movie. She's over exaggerating ""serving"" to a cringe point. She's stiff, but not in the ""cruel pretty"" or ""wolfish"" way that Dr. Cable is meant to be. It's just a complete mischaracterization that is very distracting. It feels over acted and comically bad. 

5. I forgot to mention - the beginning of the movie. Why the hell is so much explanatory content smashed into a small montage? And it's like, badly done. AND wrong. In the books, what destroys the Rusties is an oil virus that attacks anything made of petroleum and makes it explosive. This caused an immediate, swift, and violent destruction of society. The white weed is also portrayed incorrectly. The white weed was bioengineered to be able to grow in different climates, and subsequently took over and choked out all plant life. It was not, and was never a power source or something that forces people to live in cities. What the fuck does that even mean? 

6. Tally's reason for leaving to find Shay + burning the weed: the reason why changing the white weed plot line is so detrimental is because it fundamentally changes the story. In the book, the cities are actually trying to maintain the planet, not destroy it with this weed. They are the ones who send out rangers to burn it to prevent it from spreading, which makes this whole scene with David flying a helicopter (when the fuck did David become a helicopter pilot y'all) so fucking dumb. Tally is told that The Smoke is destroying the planet with their clearcutting and burning trees and hunting. Tally leaves because she is told she will remain ugly forever. 

7. Changing the directions to The Smoke: again, a needless plot change. Why? What was wrong eith the original? It was just as interesting, why would it need to be changed at all? And when Tally is in the woods on her way, she starts a fire. That is one of the MAIN THINGS that are taboo in the books, LOL. Like????

8. David is never the leader of the smoke. He never gives a big speech about how they're all revels against the city. The Smoke is, originally, just a small band of people living their lives away from the city. It's not until later that they become rebels. And even then, David is not ""the leader."" There is never any weapon they want to use to take out cities. 

9. Middle pretties are supposed to have a confident wiseness about them. Whoever the actor is for the nurse in the hospital looks like she just came off of a porn set. Middle pretties are supposed to be beautiful, but in a subtle, less flashy, reassuring way. Not.. porny. 

10. Specials sending scouts never happened. The only time the Specials came was when called or alerted by trackers. It's another weird storyline twist to make them seem evil while at the same time doing it in a comedic supervillain way. 

11. The cure is never defined as a weapon, and it isn't something widely known. The cities don't really know it exists until Pretties. There isn't an element of the cure missing that Maddy needs to find. 

12. The Pretty population is too rambunctious. Yes, pretties have a lot of parties. But they're more vapid and aloof. The operation is even referred to as the ""bubblehead"" operation. They're docile, placcid. They are characterized wrong. 

13. Peris is never a special. This is such a weird and wild deviation. Dr. C isn't looking for David. There's never this big confrontation with everyone watching. The entire sequence of the Specials coming is completely wrong. Peris absolutely does not kill Az, and that doesn't happen at The Smoke. He isnt killed as a revenge tactic or to get David to come out. Hes killed in a medical experiment gone wrong. Tally is not called out in front of the entire Smoke, and David doesn't learn about her betrayal until later. 

14. The entire ""rescue"" sequence just had me rolling my eyes, honestly. It's like whoever wrote the script just wrote a 10x worse version of what happened. Like if you played a game of telephone and told someone the whole plot and they had to regurgitate it to you but they missed every key detail. 

15. Again with the evil Peris. I don't even know what to say about that one, it's just so incredibly bad, and a wild misscharacterization for what? For WHAT? Does it even add anything to the movie except a shitty fight scene? Nope!

16. What they ""needed"" for the cure was not an additional part. They needed informed consent. Why does adding an additional part of needing this ingredient so important? Again, what does it actually add to the movie? ""I'll leave you a sign"" no, that doesn't happen either. The whole point is that they smuggle the cure to her in Pretties and she writes this entire note to herself about her informed consent. It's setting up for some other wack ass plotline that's just, again, stupid. 


What I liked: the movie looked nice. Good soundtrack. They got the last words of the book right.

"District 9 is brilliant- what is it really about? I just rewatched District 9 for the first time in a while. Every time I watch it I am blown away by how relevant it's themes are to today.

 On the surface you might say it's just a sci-fi action flick but it goes much deeper than that. There are clearly themes about migration, the industrial military complex, class, racism, discrimination, etc. 

Wikus is your typical ""every man"" bureaucrat, who's just going about his job, kind of an unsympathetic character who treats the aliens like shit (until he's in their place). 

The ""Prawns"" and their motivations we seem to know little about, only that they're mostly ""worker class"" of low intelligence, yet there appear to be others mixed in like Mr. Johnson who appears to be a scientist, navigator or some sort of skilled worker.

I'm wondering what people generally think of the movie? It's interesting how open ended the story was left- was there ever plans for a sequel?",normal
"A nice detail about Psycho Saw Psycho this weekend and felt like I was rediscovering so much of it, especially the dialogue scenes and side characters that I forgot about after not seeing it for years. One thing that stood out to me:

Marion‚Äôs lover Sam looks strikingly similar to Norman in the opening scene. Whether or not it was intentional, it makes Marion‚Äôs (relative) trust of Norman make more sense since he looks so much like her lover.

"Recommend movie similar to viral TikTok/reddit lamp story  Story pasted below if not familiar *not my story*

My last semester at a certain college I was assulted by a football player for walking where he was trying to drive (note he was 325lbs | was 120lbs), while unconscious on the ground I lived a different life.
I met a wonderful young lady, she made my heart skip and my face red, I pursued her for months and dispatched a few jerk boyfriends before I finally won her over, after two years we got married and almost immediately she bore me a daughter.
Thad a great job and my wife didn't have to work outside of the house, when my daughter was two she [my wife] bore me a son. My son was the joy of my life, I would walk into his room every morning before I left for work and doted on him and my daughter.
One day while sitting on the couch I noticed that the perspective of the lamp was odd, like inverted. It was still in 3D but... just.. wrong. (It was a square lamp base, red with gold trim on 4 legs and a white square shade).
I was transfixed, I couldn't look away from it. I stayed up all night staring at it, the next morning I didn't go to work, something was just not right about that lamp.
I stopped eating, I left the couch only to use the bathroom at first, soon I stopped that too as I wasn't eating or drinking. I stared at the fucking lamp for 3 days before my wife got really worried, she had someone come and try to talk to me, by this time my cognizance was breaking up and my wife was freaking out. She took the kids to her mother's house just before I had my epiphany.... the lamp is not real.... the house is not real, my wife, my kids... none of that is real... the last 10 years of my life are not fucking real!
The lamp started to grow wider and deeper, it was still inverted dimensions, it took up my entire perspecti and all I could see was red, I heard voices, screams, .... kinds of weird noises and I became aware of pain.... a fucking shit ton of pain... the first words I said were ""I'm missing teeth"" and opened my eyes. I was laying on my back on the sidewalk surrounded by people that I didn't know, lots were freaking out, I was completely confused.
at some point a cop scooped me up, dragged/walked me across the sidewalk and grass and threw me face down in the back of a cop car, I was still confused.
I was taken to the hospital by the cop (seems he didn't want to wait for the ambulance to arrive) and give CT scans and shit..
I went through about 3 years of horrid depression, I was grieving the loss of my wife and children and dealing with the knowledge that they never existed, I was scared that I was going insane as I would cry myself to sleep hoping I would see her in my dreams. I never have, but sometimes I see my son, usually just a glimpse out of my peripheral vision, he is perpetually 5 years old and I can never hear what he says.",normal

"Unproduced Steven Spielberg autobiography Decades before the made The Fabelmans, in the late 1970's, Steven Spielberg wanted to do a autobiographical movie about his young adulthood in Arizona. A script was written by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale (a.k.a. The Two Bobs), who had already written 1941, which Spielberg was about to direct. But he wanted to make this movie right before that. 

So, Spielberg hired the Two Bobs to script the movie, first titled ""After School"", then ""Clearwater"", and finally ""Growing Up"". Spielberg said ""It's my first vendetta film. I'm going to get back at about twenty people I've always wanted to get back at."" 

The script that the Two Bobs had written would've been an R rated comedy. Lots of swear words. Spielberg totally approved the script saying, ""I don't want to make a movie about children that's dimples or cuteness."" The movie was gonna be shot in May of 1978 with a budget of just $1.5 million dollars. 

The director of photography was gonna be Caleb Deschanel (father of Zooey and Emily), but when he read the script, he called it ""disgusting"". Apparently, that caused Spielberg to back out of the movie and not make it. 

But can you imagine if he had made it? It would've been his first true, honest to God R rated movie. What do you guys think?",normal

I always knew Part II was considered like one of the greatest movies of all time, but to me the biggest problem (that was also in part 1 but it wasn‚Äôt as bad) was the name dropping (for lack of a better term). They just kept saying names of people, only for them to show up on the screen without anything telling me ‚Äúthis is X guy who they were talking about before‚Äù. I‚Äôm ashamed to admit it took me until the hearing scene to realise Frankie and Pentangeli were the same person‚Ä¶ 

The name dropping combined with Mike looking for who tried to kill him gave birth to a sequence of scenes where they just talked about people that I didn‚Äôt know, and that I didn‚Äôt connect to the names when they showed up. It got so bad (and honestly just boring, since I wasn‚Äôt getting anything that was going on) that I fell asleep for 1-2minutes a few times and this only happens to me when I‚Äôm watching a BAD movie, like a REALLY BAD one.

Since, as I said, it‚Äôs considered one of the staples of cinema, I‚Äôd like to try again (was thinking Friday), but I need to know is h to us some kind of common issue? Cuz at one point I started wondering if I‚Äôm just stupid. also, who was the one that ordered the killing of Mike? Was it left dubious on purpose? WHY did Frankie not talk when he saw his brother, did they explain this in any way? I have so many questions and it‚Äôs bothering me. Is there anything I can do to understand everything on my second watch, so that I can hopefully see what everyone else sees in this movie? Please, help me

"Moral Dilemmas In Movies - Suggestions I‚Äôm looking for examples of moral dilemmas that come up in movies? It doesn't have to be central to the plot, but it should be an easy reference point for anyone familiar with the movie. And the movie should be fictional, and preferably from the past 5-10 years.

For context, I run a podcast\* that analyzes ambiguous moral situations in movies and TV shows and I'm running short on ideas. I listed several examples of scenarios I have analyzed or will analyze:

1. **Harry Potter**.
   1. Does Harry owe the Dursleys a debt of gratitude?
   2. (about Snape)>!Was Snape murdering Dumbledore justified?!<
2. **Star Wars**. Did Darth Vader truly redeem himself?
3. **Good Will Hunting**. Does Will have a moral obligation to use his genius?
4. **Lord of the Rings**. (It's about the end)>!Was Frodo's failure a moral failure?!<
5. **Robin Hood**. Can you steal from the rich to give to the poor?
6. **Saving Private Ryan**. The morality of the mission (which itself is mentioned in the film).
7. **The Matrix**. Blue pill v. red pill - is there a right choice between a difficult reality and a comfortable illusion?

I've got others. Like superheroes and vigilante-ism. Or The Office and the morality of pranking other people. I also have some scenarios from Game of Thrones (the Red Wedding, Jaime killing the Mad King).

"My Old Ass (2024) missed the greatest opportunity ever to pair up Jenna Ortega and Aubrey Plaza I'm probably not the only one to have thought about this. I still wanted to make a post though...

So My Old Ass stars Maisy Stella and Aubrey Plaza as the younger and older versions of the same person. The description reads: ""An 18th-birthday mushroom trip brings Elliott face-to-face with her wisecracking 39-year-old self"". So the younger and older versions have scenes together, the two actors are playing against each other all the time.

So already; what a legendary pairing this could have been for Jenna and Aubrey! There are plenty of memes on the internet about how they both kinda look alike and can play very similar characters. What caused the whole idea was most likely the similarly deadpan, creepy, but loveable characters of Aubrey's in Parks and Rec and Jenna's in Wednesday.

And on top of that, the director, Megan Park's previous movie, The Fallout (2021) even starred Jenna Ortega. I genuenly wouldn't be surprised if Park had thought up the idea for this movie back then with Jenna and Aubrey in mind for these parts, but in the end Jenna couldn't make it for some reason. But maybe I'm totally wrong there. It's a pretty fun coincidence, still.

(BTW with this post I'm not trying to say that the Maisy Stella - Aubrey Plaza duo is bad. On the contrary!)",normal
"Discussion of Carol (2015): My Favorite Movie of All Time Flung Out of Space I recently rewatched Carol for the first time in a year and I fell head over heels in love with again as I always do. The yearning, the gazes, the danger, and the unspoken words that the air seems to vibrate with make this the most romantic movie I have ever seen.

I had a couple of topics I wanted to bring up to open up a dialogue on what a couple of the lines in the movie mean to you all. (WARNING: spoilers ahead - but if you still haven't seen the movie what are you doing?!)

First, when Carol says ""what a strange girl you are. Flung out of space"" when they first meet over lunch and then again in the middle of the first time her and Therese make their relationship relationship - what do you think that means/what does that line mean to you?

Additionally, when Therese calls Carol on the phone and says ""I want to ask you things but I'm not sure you'd want that"" and Carol says ""ask me things, please."" Why do you think she says that?

Finally, the letter Carol writes Therese when she leaves her to head back to New York to attempt play by Harge's rules to get Rindy back after the tape of her sex with Therese is sent by the private investigator.

*Dearest,*

*There are no accidents, and he would have found us one way or another. Everything comes full circle. Be grateful it was sooner rather than later.*

*You'll think it harsh of me to say so, but no explanation I offer will satisfy you. Please don't be angry when I tell you that you seek resolutions and explanations because you are young. But you will understand this one day. And when it happens, I want you to imagine me there to greet you. Our lives stretched out ahead of us, a perpetual sunrise.*

*But until then, there must be no contact between us. I have much to do, and you, my darling, even more. Please believe that I would do anything to see you happy.*

*So, I do the only thing I can.*

*I release you.*

What does that letter mean? 

I LOVE THIS MOVIE and I would love to hear your thoughts on it.",normal
"Can a bad performance ruin a movie, and if yes, which one (and say why)? Millie Perkins as Anne Frank in ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" is a good example. George Stevens made an exceptional film, with some scenes so brilliant shot that they are unforgettable like the attic scene of Anne and Frank doing the laundry, but Millie Perkins as Anne is unbelievably bad. This isn't just a mediocre performance, this was a performance that is downright amauterish, literally no emotion in almost every line she says. She was Ali MacGraw bad. And it ruined the movie for me because I couldn't get over it. As superb as the supporting actors were, Shellley Winters even won an Oscar, Perkins made it impossible for the movie to rise above its flawed central casting. 

""House of Gucci"" is not a great great movie but it would be taken seriously if Jared Leto didn't play his role like he was auditioning for Super Mario Bros. The worst part, the real person didn't act that way but Leto thought a Italian caricature would be showier.",normal

"Jim Carrey's ""The Cable Guy"", a dark comedy that was completely different from the Ace Venturas and Masks I still think ""The Cable Guy"" is Jim Carrey's best comedy because it was dark, it was unexpected, it was daring and Carrey's humor wasn't just him do the talking anus or do silly poses, it had meaning and Carrey dared to play the bad guy without coming across as Ace Ventura in a green body suit like he did in ""Batman Forever"".

I think everything in this movie works. I didn't even mind Matthew Broderick or Leslie Mann being wasted in a girlfriend part. Broderick works as a straight man to Carrey's character, even if I didn't find Broderick charismatic enough to worth all that work from Carrey.

It's like you watch Bridget Fonda in Single White Female, you get it, but Broderick always came across as a middle-aged nerd in everything I've seen him in.",normal

"""All About Eve"": What is your view on the film and its morally ambiguous protagonist? I think the tragedy about Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) is that she didn't need to lie, to manipulate, to create discord, if her main goal was to become a serious actress, because she had the talent for it. If only she believed in her worth, maybe it would have prevented her from screwing everyone around her. 

When Eve talks about the meaning of Theater for her, you're moved by her passion. That's one of the few qualities she does have and even that she messes up when, by the end, she's about to go to Hollywood. In essence, Eve is self-destructive, always ruining her chances at happiness and remaining unfulfilled. Staying married to Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) is bad enough. 

Margo Channing (Bette Davis) started out as insecure and paranoid about getting old but by the end, she overcame that. She's satisfied, staying married to Bill (Gary Merrill). Eve doesn't have a Bill of her own to keep her grounded.",normal

"Do I deserve love knowing I am what I am? - Bones & All review ‚ÄúThe world of love had no place for monsters in it.‚Äù

Bones & All review

This is the second Luca Guadagnino movie I have seen and I watched it right after Challengers. I enjoyed Bones & All more.

>!&#x200B;!<Probably because the director manages to create this post-apocalyptic feeling based around the fact that these cannibals just avoid people as much as they can, their time is spent isolated, most of that isolation is spent in running away from connection, from society and Luca Guadaningo builds the movie‚Äôs theme around this loneliness. He creates beauty among the empty abandoned houses that eaters use, he creates style in them by clothing them with vibrant or more grounded colors, he makes us listen to them by giving them specific musical connections. Maren the main protagonist has this single guitar string that plays really loud in the silence whenever she gets closer to where she‚Äôs going. >!&#x200B;!<

It feels romantic to me because it also captures the scenic rurality of America so well. There are a lot of shots of just the skies as the two main characters drive across states, from Ohio to Kentucky to Missouri and Minnesota. The beautiful green fields, the forests, a small town here and there, s carnival it‚Äôs all there. I have never seen a more beautiful and aesthetically pleasing America as it is.

Bones & All is a moving coming-of-age tale about the innocence of age and shows the struggle with accepting who we are when nobody else does. Everything looks like a memory of an innocent age, in a contrast to ‚ÄúChallengers‚Äù, Bones & All has a softer aesthetic to it. There are no lavishly executed shots of one character in the frame to make them look like super models as in ‚ÄúChallengers‚Äù, everything just feels more natural.

The thesis of this movie as I see it is, do you deserve love and other good things even if you are so unwanted by society?

It's already the 12th day of my journey through Europe on film and since yesterday we've also been accompanied on Letterboxd. The wonderful  u/robsonmb has started to perpetuate the results of these Reddit threads  in a new watchlist, which you can find [here](https://letterboxd.com/lalunallena/list/reddits-favourite-movie-by-european-country/share/N58XneSCnjHwwiJw/detail/) and the next entry there will be the winner for Cyprus - a movie called ***Smuggling Hendrix*** (I haven't found a title in one of the two official Cypriot languages, but I would add the original title if it is not identical to the English one).

Unfortunately, this time too, participation was not quite as lively as in the case of Belgium, for example. Is it the day of the week or the films? We don't know, but today we are definitely going on to the next xountry: **Czechia**. As always, I I would like to remind you of the following rules of the game:

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

"Watched Dragged Across Concrete (2018) because I trusted the director And I was pleasantly surprised. This came up on my radar after rewatching Bone Tomahawk and Brawl in Cell Block 99, and I remember why I and I had ignored it before: Pretty much with post modern Mel Gibson is sure to be conservative edging, Fox News echo chamber nonsense (the gender comment about who is singing the songs,  the wifes ‚Äúthis is making me racist‚Äù, the movies treatment of the only black/brown characters in the film) almost turned me off in the first 30 mins but I‚Äôm not mad that I found myself locked in

The way the dialogue was delivered was interesting, slim especially had an theatre flair to it. The quick brutality of violence being paired with that. Clear villains with grey heroes to root for. It wasn‚Äôt crazy original, but I felt it was well done

And Don‚Äôt Close The Drive In, by Butch Tavares: the song is perfect for the scene it drops in. I‚Äôm a sucker for a good soundtrack and that song on its own elevated it another half a point for me ",normal

"Which other films have a Tragic story attached? (An Elephant Sitting Still) Which other Movies have a Tragic Story attached to Them or their Crew and what is it?

I watched An Elephant Sitting Still the other day, a slow (you could say, contemplative) movie about a lot of things, most of them negative, such as pain, regret, disgust, alienation, apathy.

I had heard about the hype for the film on the icheckmovies forum years ago, but the running time kept me from watching. I honestly thought it was directed by Gan Bi since he'd directed Kaili Blues which, to me, looked similar topically and visually at the time.

So anyway, turns out the director, Hu Bo, who's in my birth year, committed suicide shortly after completing the film. I would assume that parts of this movie were autobiographical and a mix of the emotions that he felt, and likely a regret that haunted his adult life.

I'm wondering if there are any other films out there that you've come across with such a tragic circumstance. They don't have to be linked to the director, it could be a screenwriter or someone else integral to the film.

I'm sure most are aware of Brandon Lee's death on set, so perhaps something not so obvious, but hey, whatever, do as you will.

Do note that An Elephant Sitting Still is not for everyone and it is 4 hours long. I would recommend trying out the aforementioned Kaili Blues or Black Coal, Thin Ice or The Wild Goose Lake and then Eureka (2000) or maybe something more fun like Blue Spring or All About Lily Chou-Chou to get you in the mood.

"Rewatched 'Adaptation (2002) and it is not about screenwriting. I had watched Adaptation quite a few years back and I remember seeing florida, crocodiles and some guy hopelessly trying to write something about mundane. It was a fun watch, but I didn't know why.

Now, years later, I watched an instagram reel which showcases the monologue of Mckee to Charlie Kaufmann about life being the most interesting thing ever and if he (Charlie) think that it is just mundane things and no big revelations he should not write a movie(I will put a youtube link below if anyone'sinterested or forgot about the scene). That scene haunted me, I dont remember that scene the movie, what else was I missing, what was the movie really about? 

Then, I rewatched the movie and boy, I think I understand now what the movie really was about. The title Adaptation on the superficial sense points to Charlie's attempts to adapt the book into a movie, but on a deeper level it is the adaptation to life itself. Of how we change into something we were not, and how passions drive us to it.

In the beginning, Charlie is a firm believer of life is boring with mundane shits repeating day after day and the movies and books are all glorification of life which has no truth in it. We see later, the author of the book about orchid (Susan Orlean) has similar views about life until she meets Laroch (the guy with no front tooth). But soon enough, she admires and even be jealous of the passion of Laroch to the things he is currently doing, whether be it fishing, planting or even hunting orchids. He is not ashamed of his passions even if they are illegal or immoral in other people's eyes. This is something Susan have hard time to wrap her head around. Even though she is a very successful journalist, she is not passionate about anything, she can't be who she really is without being ashamed of herself. This shame about oneself and admiration to the other, she latches onto Laroch as a leech and follows him in his journey.

Charlie is in a similar state of mind. He is ashamed of the persona he projects into the world, his blockbusters are what he himslef would call lifeless and untrue, and he wants to be honest for once. To be honest, is to be courageous, and he lacks courage to what needs to be done. He lacks the passion to the world. He hates life. When he reads The book Susan wrote, he is captivated by something in it. He cannot pinpoint it, and he misinterprets the book as a mundane book about flowers and thats what makes it great. He wants to make a movie about flowers being great, but he himself doesn't believe it. So what exactly is he seeking? What is hooking him to this book?

We see Laroch is a pretty smart guy who is really good at what he's doing. But his passions have changed a lot in the years and he never looked back. He is not doing anything for fame or money, but to the thrill of doing something he really cares about. What Susan, and Charlie through her seeking is, how to be passionate about something without being ashamed of the passion. That is what draws Susan to Leroch, Charlie to the book, and us the audience to the movie without us being aware of it.

Orchids are fascinating. Each species has a specific morphology which resembles a specific animal and they make love to each other. And when the bee makes love to two of these orchids, they get pollinated. The orchid or the bee does not have the ability to comprehend their actions on a grander scale. Whay they do is just following their passion and the that keeps the world going, without them knowing it. We are all orchids. And bees. Whatever we do, we dont know its significance. We are not passionate about anything because we will(will as in Will) it, but because we have no choice. We are destined to live however the way we live. And the world will rotate.

We do not make the change, we are changed when it is time to. It is not a willful choice, but an inevitability. The movie says, not to worry about being unable to change, being unable to chase your passions or being unable to be honest or courageous. Whatever you chase, even if you know it consciously or not, will be the road you'll be taking. You are seeking your orchids always.

I know this write up came up as mumbo jumbo in the screen. It was clear in mind though. I have not done justice to the movie. If you haven't watched the movie or if you forgot what the movie was about, do give it another shot. Its a fantastic one.

1) terminator. By lord my favourite franchise and I enjoyed T1 and 2 but why so many alt timelines and reboots? Just move it forward I wish we got the proper Kyle Reece dream future war scenes and the final battle to defeat Skynet. I am still waiting for it and keen to see that play out. Then I also kinda felt the salvation story angle, the 2 comic novels were also interesting to follow it. For sure don't think it is as bad as so manyade it to be. I felt the dark fate timeline is terrible and ruins everything that the franchise stood for.



2) the DC darkseid timeline. I liked man of steel and the directors cut of justice league. Sure all the DC hero movies were not as good but I was invested in that timeline and ready to see the fight against the big bad. Do feel bad we will never see it and they are rebooting it but I respected the serious and darker tone that DC set, it did not need to be light hearted bright and funny with punchlines like marvel were trying.",normal

"Juror No. 2 - WB was correct to bury this movie SPOILERS AHEAD

For the majority of its runtime, Juror No. 2 is a perfectly solid courtroom drama. It's not the greatest movie ever made, but it's competently produced with an interesting premise, and I was enjoying it throughly. >!But then the ending comes along. What the hell was that?! This is one of, if not THE laziest movie endings I have ever seen. If Clint Eastwood and screenwriter Jonathan Abrams had picked¬†*literally any other*¬†potential ending and just committed to it, it would have been a better choice. This faux ambiguous ending bullshit is just creatively bankrupt cowardice, the product of moviemakers who don't know how to finish their story and don't want to be bothered to try so they pass that work onto the audience and pretend it's an actual decision rather than the lack of any decision at all. The movie is already full of interesting moral questions, no matter how it ended people would have been talking about whether the right choices were made and whether justice was truly served. Now all I can think about is how mad I am that Eastwood had the gall to dump this half finished mess into the theaters and call it a day.!<

>!When the movie ended several people in my theater were audibly disappointed, saying things like ""WTF was that?!"" or ""No! Don't end it that way!"" so I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'd be interested to hear from anyone else who has seen the movie. It's a shame because the rest of the movie was quite decent but the ending annoyed me so much I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I do not endorse cowardice in the arts.!<

"Boy Kills World had incredible fight choreography/camerawork. Very fun movie overall I‚Äôm surprised a lot of people are mixed on this film. While it has its flaws, I think it also has a great sense of personality with the characters, colorful sets, and especially the action. Crazy objects are used like carrots and cheese graters, the camera is swinging around at high velocity, lots of gun fu, and probably the highlight for me is when they fight the weird ass guard who keeps fighting after getting stabbed and having his arm torn off by using an inhaler.

"Moon (2009) subverts an overused sci-fi trope The evil AI trope is, I think, overused in movies to the point where it is almost its own subgenre. The initially benevolent artificial intelligence turns evil and the last act is man vs cold unfeeling machine? boring, cliche, played out. 

I just saw Duncan Jones' movie Moon, and I fully expected the AI in it to do what so many lesser sci-fi movies do and go full HAL 9000 on Sam Rockwell - and considering the AI was voiced by Kevin fucking Spacey I wouldn't have been surprised. But the movie's robot companion remains a faithful and loyal servant throughout, and even ends up saving the protagonist in the end. It's very touching and I think means something, because in the end none of the human characters really cared for Sam - his bosses don't care about him because he's a disposable clone, his wife isn't even really his wife, even his original self sold out to the company and allowed his clones to be worked and killed off. In the end, it is a cold, unfeeling machine that is his only aide. 

For a movie that is about man's ability to use technology to serve himself regardless of the moral implications, it's interesting that the robot acts the most ""human"".",normal

"Why Disney won't make fun pirate movies. Disney should make fun Pirate adventures. No, NOT Pirates of the Caribbean!

There is a serious lack of fun and colorful pirates movies with the typical classic pirates props-

and Disney would \_have\_ the best opportunity to do so.

Forget your franchises and industry. Tell FUN STORIES.

With a little bit of creativity- you can easily come up with likeable and loveable sympathetic characters that are NOT Jack Sparrow. I'm not saying I have any creativity.

However I love the POTC movies (first 3) somehow they are a guilty pleasure- they are NOT colorful- however still funny. Look at the color palettes and muted grading. They are easily as bad as the later Harry Potter movies (ok not THAT bad). The only scenes with real lush colors are on the Island in the second movie.

I wanna see the Jungles and stone masonry and harbour villages and the pillaging and the drinking and the stinking, the dirty behavior the corruption the fun, the beaches and the water and the boats and the bell towers and the iron crosses and the crucified skeletons, the treasure chests the fine pirate ladies the adventure loving children and men the mystery and the treasures and the morales and the search for meaning.

"Edward Norton‚Äôs Filmography is Insane What do you think his best role is? I think it‚Äôs gotta be American History X, but it‚Äôs very close between that and Primal Fear. He was just perfect for that role in AHX. I think he and Edward Furlong, which by the way is a huge shame what happened to him. But the whole time watching AHX I was amazed at Nortons ability to pull off that character which was a very hard role to be good in for any actor in my opinion, for obvious reasons lol. After that he became lead man in many great critically acclaimed films in which a few have been considered classics. 

Norton has been nominated for Oscar‚Äôs for AHX as best actor, and Birdman and Primal Fear for best supporting actor. I believe he should have won for AHX and also Primal Fear, but unfortunately the iconic film came out the same year so Roberto Benigni won in 1999. In 1997 Cuba Gooding won best supporting and 2014 JK Simmons won for Whiplash, very deservingly. 

Some other notable films Norton has been in other than American History X and Primal Fear and Birdman are F**** C*** (üòÇ), 25th hour, The Score, Kingdom of Heaven, Red Dragon, Rounders, The People vs Larry Flynt, The Italian Job, The Illusionist, Moonrise Kingdom, and The Grand Budapest Hotel.

"Don't move more like Don't watch. It took me two days to finish this movie because it was really that boring.

The only saving grace is that the actors were amazing but the writers write like teenaged boys.I heard good reviews about the movie so decided to try and finish it and boy was I disappointed.

where do I even start?Minor annoyances is they really did not give us much reason to root for the final girl, in fact after the second guy died  I was kind of thinking, damn just end her already.The movies started with an interesting premise, girl who wants to commit suicide gets taken by serial killer.Yet they only draw back on that right at the very end, the killers background story also seems completely pointless as there's no character arc.He's just a crazy guy with a family and she's just sad girl with a dead son.

A lot of the scenes didnt make sense, I think  a major flaw is that the film constantly hits us over the head that this isn't the first time he's done this.Yet he's making so many rookie mistakes, they did not show us that maybe he's just panicking now as things are going left. It just felt like he was naturally a dumb ass.I think a hyperrealistic ending would have been great since everything else before that fell flat.If he had killed her while she begged to live. It would have been a cold ending but a memorable one and tied well into the beginning.

But no she's somehow a ninja who secretly steals a knife while not only tied up but injected with a paralytic.That being said ,he specifically says that even if she gains movement she won't have enough motor skills yet someone has the motor skills to sneakily steal a knife and then precisely stab him with enough force.Then also swim back to shore to stand victoriously over his body.

 It feels like they were desperate to make another girly boss movie but as a girl I think the movie was ASS.

It does not hit the same as something like Gone girl or I spit on your grave.

"Tennis as the arena - Challengers review ‚ÄúCourt violation, audible obscenity‚Äù

Challengers Review

It‚Äôs beautiful, bold, colorful, it makes you hate it‚Äôs characters and understand them at the same time and it has some really hard soundtrack that plays whenever things get heated between characters. Challengers for me, feels a little too long, a bit too over indulgent, and sometimes out of place and time but somehow the movie manages to make you feel like it‚Äôs 2h 15m runtime is justified. It starts at present and then jumps back to the past and then present, sort of going back-and-forth but everytime the distance becomes reduced until it reaches the final scene.

By that point, you know every motivation, every glance, every movement of the camera and it all speaks so much about the characters and how they feel in that moment.

This is also a lot more about tennis then i imagined. Just amazes me to see these actors being so comfortable and awesome with a racket in their hands, serving and playing tennis often in one-shot sequences where everything could have gone wrong.

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

"Discussion: Top 10 1990's movies A lot of movies I have watched recently are from the 1990s. I have always found this era to be the my favourite decade for cinema (and arguably one of the best alongside the 1970s). The 90s saw countless great releases as we entered further into a new age of digital, writing, effects, acting, etc.

"I need to write a paper on [some artist's] influence on the English language, and argue why we should add it into the curriculum for English majors. Any director or film suggestions? 
We cannot choose any forms of literature, like poetry or drama for example, because those two are already in the curriculum (e.g. Shakespeare, Byron, Mary Shelley, etc.)

I am therefore required to pick a different art form (maybe film, photography, visual arts, painting, illustration, architecture, music, etc.) and choose a specific artist who is working/had worked in this art style and has significantly influenced the English language. I need to make a compelling argument for why we should add this artist into the English major's curriculum and I also need a topic that has enough cultural significance to the point of having had multiple academic articles written on it. I can't just rely on internet research like magazines or Wikipedia. I need actual academic articles or journals written about this topic, meaning that it has to be something that isn't too new.

I was going to pick the influence of British rock music on English phrasing, for example The Beatles, but someone had already beaten me to it. So I am completely out of any other ideas.

"I don't think I've ever seen a realistic use of a knife to attack someone in a movie. Except maybe someone getting shanked in jail. Have you? (Seen a convincing knife scene I mean, not shanked someone) The most convincing knife scenes are of someone spreading butter. But in scenes of violence, even in the gritty movies, a knife is used to slash or used for a single deadly stab.

IRL instances of violence with a knife we see reports of people getting stabbed dozens of times. Which makes sense because unless there's surgical precision and a dummy for a victim, odds are someone will get stabbed where they can live to struggle, even if for 5 minutes before bleeding out.

In knife fight scenes the attacker never rushes for 30 stabs. Even the killer in a slasher movie, the closest to a convincing use of a knife, the psycho killer will slowly stab his victim a couple of times. In thrillers someone pulls a knife against the bad guy, then they just slash never go for a stab. If they did, of course, a single stab would kill the bad guy. If it's a stab in the back, he screams and dies. Twice unconvincing according to those in the know.

So TL;DR rant over.

Have you ever seen any a convincingly realistic knife fight scene? Or any realistic knife attack scenes?

I suppose a proper realistic scene would make anyone squirm.",normal

"My favorite scary movies from pursuing Reddit posts this year I‚Äôve always been a fan of scary movies, but I will admit that I hadn‚Äôt watched many in the past few years that really hit the spot.  I decided to make notes of some movies that I felt would pique my interest from several different Reddit posts, and there were a few this year that really gripped me

In no particular order the ones that you all helped me with that I thought were great:

Late Night with the Devil
Barbarian
Hell House LLC
House of the Devil
1408

My girlfriend doesn‚Äôt like scary movies (which is a shame, and probably why I haven‚Äôt watched as many lately), so we have an agreement that I get to make her watch 1 every Halloween.  I got her off to a rough start a few years ago with Hereditary, then let her off easy the next year with Gremlins (a childhood movie which she admittedly was scared of), then this year I built her up with 1408.  I think Barbarian would be a good step up again for her next year unless my newfound appreciation of the thrill let‚Äôs me choose another one that would fit the time and the place

If anyone else has any good recommendations based off the above I would greatly appreciate it.  Some of the my favorites that I‚Äôve seen not mentioned above, but which may also include some mind-fuck movies Ives enjoyed:

Rec
The Exorcism of Emily Rose
The Decent
Joker (1st one with J. Phoenix I consider that a horror)
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

"Training Day (Questions about Roger) 
I‚Äôve got some questions I can‚Äôt shake after watching Training Day for the millionth time (and after reading a bunch of threads here on Reddit). I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts:

	1.	Who is Roger talking to on the phone?
	‚Ä¢	Roger says things like ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt do a thing for you. Your mess. You clean it up. Don‚Äôt be callin‚Äô me.‚Äù He acts like it‚Äôs no big deal, even though the caller sounds stressed. Do you think Roger‚Äôs brushing it off to avoid drawing attention? Or could he actually be talking to Alonzo in a way that mirrors Alonzo‚Äôs own mess?

	2.	Does Roger‚Äôs ability to identify Hoyt change anything?
	‚Ä¢	When Roger says, ‚ÄúYou play strong safety for North Hollywood High?‚Äù it seems to make Alonzo tense up a bit. Do you think the fact that Roger recognizes Hoyt as a player from North Hollywood affects how Alonzo sees him? Like, does knowing this make Hoyt more of a potential liability in Alonzo‚Äôs eyes?

	3.	What‚Äôs up with that snail joke?
	‚Ä¢	Roger says, ‚ÄúFigure that joke out and you‚Äôll figure the streets out.‚Äù Do you think there‚Äôs any merit to that? Is there some kind of meaning to the joke that‚Äôs meant to reflect the life they‚Äôre living, or is he just messing with Hoyt?

	4.	Why does Alonzo even stop by Roger‚Äôs the first time?
	‚Ä¢	There‚Äôs got to be a reason beyond just visiting an old friend. Alonzo seems like he always has a purpose. What‚Äôs his real agenda here?

	5.	Is Roger a former cop or just a well-connected drug dealer?
	‚Ä¢	Roger knows a lot about Alonzo‚Äôs early days and mentions things like, ‚ÄúYou were just like him,‚Äù when he talks to Alonzo about Hoyt. Do you think he could be ex-law enforcement, or is he just that deep into the street world?

"Lee- 2024 A really good modern war movie. My problem with modern war movies is they are all the same,  not this one. This is a beautiful story about a model turned world war 2 photographer. What I loved about this film is that you only see the war through her pictures. It focuses way more on her issues being a woman on the front line and her relationships with her friends, husband and soldiers. I thought Kate Winslet was in her element but the stand out performer was Andy Samberg. For his first serious role once you get over his comedic past he shines and really makes you believe his feelings for Lee and how scared and fragile he is. 8/10 best war film I've watched in years.

"Dawn of the Dead (1978) ending - I'm so baffled by their actions but I kind of love it (spoilers) I've just watched it for the first time.

So in Dawn of the Dead we see the protagonists getting so wrapped up with making a life at the mall, they never stop to think of an exit plan. 

Then when the army of bandits eventually come, rather than just making a getaway in the helicopter, they just fuck about in the mall and Steven gets himself killed and zombified. Then when it's clear Peter and Francine need to go, they're just waiting around at the ladder and Peter for some reason wants to sacrifice himself, when they've both got more than enough time to go. Eventually, Francine goes up to the helicopter and Peter just retrieves into his room. He locks himself inside and is clearly about to blow his brains out.

Then when the zombies do get in, he has a change of heart and has to desperately fight his way through. He then runs up to the helicopter, while fighting them off and getting his gun grabbed off him by one of them, making a narrow escape.  

Once they're flying away, she admits they don't have very much fuel. 

It just seems like such a baffling way they've all behaved. Surely, they should of all just escaped straight away on the helicopter and been more prepared. Throughout the film, it just felt like the characters were getting more and more complacent. Especially Roger, he was way too comfortable around them before he got bitten.

What do you think Romero meant by this ending?  I've heard it being said that it's a commentary on consumerism. The opening sequence in the television studio reminded me so much of covid.",normal

"How to save the Scream franchise I've been thinking on this one for a while. Scream has painted itself in a bit of a corner. The two recent leads (Ortega and Barrera) having distanced themselves, as well as on/off again casting issues with Neve Campbell.  Plus, most of the fan favorite cast members have died and/or aren't a great fit for a new Ghostface.

IMO the best thing Scream could do would be to take a page from Craven's New Nightmare, and have the next film take place in the ""real"" world - with Ghostface hunting down actors from all of the previous films (playing themselves). Cox, Arquette, Kennedy, Lillard, Gellar, etc.  It would be a perfect sendoff to such a meta franchise and one last hurrah with all the fan favorites, plus it would allow for an actual, real whodunnit scenario.

"The Purge: Anarchy - I really hate Cali Is anyone else horrifyingly annoyed by the daughter in The Purge: Anarachy movie? I rewatched all the Purge movies for Halloween this year, and I find her character to be so contrived and annoying. I looked to see if anyone else had made a post about it like everyone did for the kid in the first movie but no one did so here I am. 

Throughout the entire movie Cali asks the questions that the audience is thinking, but that we really don't need answers to because they will be answered later in the movie.

Her character somehow thinks that she's more important than she is. Like when she asked the vigilante who saved them ""why us?"", I remember yelling at the screen saying ""Because he saw you"" and at the same time he said ""because I saw you"". Like, Cali, it's not any deeper than that!!! 

Then she begs the vigilante that saves them to stay with them despite him having somewhere to go as if it's his responsibility to take care of them just because he got them out of one situation. 

Then towards the end of the movie, she's trying to convince the vigilante character that he shouldn't go do what he's about to do like they didn't just meet eight hours ago and she has any authority over his life or decisions at all. 

And when they're in the back of the van with the gang members who were collectinv stragglers to take to rich people for sport, she asked again ""what do you want from us?"" Even the Mom got annoyed at this point. 

I don't understand where she got this sense of personalized grandiosity. Maybe and obviously it's because she is one of the main characters in the movie, but the way they wrote her is absolutely the worst.

"What are you favorite awe inspiring movie moments or scenes with Dobly Atmos? I love audio and have a mid-level surround sound setup in my home. I also love showing people the power of a nice screen, scene, but *especially* how audio transforms the scenes into something much more visceral. Usually in a way my guests have never experienced before.

I have a few go-to's which never fails to stun them and makes their jaws drop:

1. The first 15 seconds of Mad Max. Really. Just the revving audio as loud as possible without hurting our ears. I'd call it an eargasm that is on par with any of my all time favorite songs. We'll also watch the rest of the intro because the sound is so good and the scene is so intense.
2. The first minute of Dune: The immediate foreign language echoing throughout the room and the drums for the Legendary logo. I'll also show them the procession of nobles from the ship onto Dune. People who aren't used to subwoofers love the bass from the drums rumbling the couch. And then the scene where the first sandworm erupts and engulfs the spice scavenger. The chords and bass notes are incredibly exhilarating after seeing the eye candy of the sand and worm.
3. There's a fight scene in Man of Steel about 1:30 in where he fights two of zod's best by himself. The fight feels so heavy and real that it makes the kryptonians seem that much more epic. The sound has aged fairly well.
4. Literally the classic Universal intro with the earth spinning.
5. Godzilla Minus One when Godzilla first shows up and is chasing the small boat. Boom.

Do you guys have any other stunning moments in movies you like to share with guests that is specifically better because of the audio? Notice that these aren't about the acting or full scenes per se, but how the audio takes everything to an entirely different level.",normal

However, I later watched both It movies, and I thought he was great. Blends humor, horror, and intensity very well (though it has similar cgi issues). I was very impressed with those, and now I‚Äôm interested with what he does next

Also, I‚Äôve heard crew members who worked with Muschietti say him and his sister/producing partner were very pleasant, which is always nice

"I watched Longlegs, Late Night With The Devil, and The Witch this spooky season. The Witch‚Äôs version of Satan is still my absolute favorite. As the title says. The wife and I watched a bunch of newer horror movies for spooky season, and we noticed the devil was a real force in many of them, including Longlegs and Late Night With The Devil.

Longlegs and Late Night With The Devil just ended up being ok to me. Both started out amazing. The leads were great, the premises were great, and the first 30 or so minutes had me hooked. But as both revealed the stories and introduced the devil as kind‚Äôve this overbearing force in the movie, I just couldn‚Äôt get into them. 

The Witch‚Äôs (Robert Eggers) portrayal of Satan, embodying Black Phillip but not revealing himself until the damage had already been done by the families own sins (the father‚Äôs pride, the mother‚Äôs envy, Caleb‚Äôs lust, etc) and the actual witch in the movie, is still my all time favorite. Thomason agrees to sell her soul and join the witches at the end because she lost everything due to her family‚Äôs innate human weakness and their acquiescence to their sinful nature. But..it‚Äôs only when she has nothing left that the Devil appears, offering ‚Äúrespite‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm not religious in the least, but I went to church until I was around 10-11, so pretty formative years. My church was heavy on fearing The Devil as a real force/entity. But not like these other two movies portrayed him, where the Devil is literally a force inside these dolls that hypnotize you into killing your family (really, Longlegs?) or a demon embodying a young girl and doing typical Exorcist shit (Late Night). 

My church‚Äôs message was more about constantly being aware of more subtle influences. That feeling of wanting to ‚Äúsin‚Äù because there‚Äôs some sense of selfish pleasure you‚Äôre seeking? *That‚Äôs* the devil‚Äôs influence. Letting drugs fuck your life up physically isn‚Äôt the devils work‚Ä¶he completed his job when you were propositioned and instead of saying no like you were taught to, like you know is ‚Äúright‚Äù to‚Ä¶that ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the worst that could happen? It‚Äôll probably be fun!‚Äù is Satan whispering from your shoulder. He‚Äôs fucking with your human weaknesses (as they saw, obviously this shit is insane lol). He‚Äôs not this force of evil that‚Äôs going to force your hand; he‚Äôs going to guide you to going through what you were already wanting to do. Your own earthly sins, your own human flaws are going to drive you into what he wants, not him forcing you or taking your body over like a demon. Your own destruction is within you, and these things that you‚Äôre told are wrong that feel pleasurable? Yeah, they‚Äôre designed to destroy you. 

Which is why when, in The Witch, when he is whispering in that calming, ethereal voice ‚ÄúWouldst thou like the taste of butter? Wouldst thou like to wear a pretty dress? Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?‚Äù, it gave me goosebumps the first time I watched the movie. I dunno that I ever feared the devil when I was little, I never really bought into religion, but if I did, this is kindve how I would‚Äôve believed he could be. Not terrifying‚Ä¶but intoxicating. Not forcing me to sin and corrupt my stupid mortal soul, but subtly encouraging me to do what I already wanted to do. One final push.

That‚Äôs why I love when Thomason says she can‚Äôt sign her name over to him, he says ‚ÄúI will guide thy hand.‚Äù 

Just brilliant! ",normal
"Palm Springs: existentialism and philosophy I've become obsessed with this film. It was recommended to me by my ex girlfriend a few years ago. I watched it and liked it. But it has played on my since. 

I have watched it several times since and I find a lot of meaning in this film, and here is my take: this film can be applied to the repetitive nature of our own existence, the challenges we face, and the apparent meaninglessness of our lives. There are three separate ways of dealing with it.

Nyles: 

His character represents absolute nihilism (is it really a coincidence that he is called Nyles?). I was initially struck by how visually similar his charter is to Peter Stormare in The Big Lebowski; two nihilists adrift from reality, floating in a pool with a beer in hand.  
For Nyles, the loop is something to surrender to. Life is meaningless, so why not submit to an endless routine of hedonism with no consequence?  Nyles represents the idea of opting out from society. The fuck it approach. He embraces apathy and self indulgence.  
I am quite sure I have spent a lot of my time in life like Nyles.

Sarah:

Sarah represents something of an existential awakening and the desire for growth and accountability. She is not like Nyles and she strongly opposes the loop. She fights it with all she has. She wishes to understand and take ownership of her mistakes. She seeks meaning and redemption through personal responsibility, and she tries to change things. She wants to break free from the past, and the cycle of guilt and self loathing that she has suffered and realises that courage and self-confrontation are required. I have also spent time in my life acting like Sarah.

Roy:

Roy is perhaps the most interesting, He starts off bitter, vengeful, and angry, but unlike the other two, he finds peace in the loop. He doesn't fight, like Sarah and he doesn't give up, like Nyles. Instead Roy represents a philosophy I have always admired: stoicism. He find acceptance. He embraces the beauty of small moments with his family. Roy teaches us that a meaningful existence can be found by appreciating being in the present, and neither fighting not capitulating to the madness we are bound to. I have never quite managed to live life like Roy, but I aspire to it.",normal
"Is there a good catastrophe movie out there where everyone keeps their cool? So I really enjoy catastrophe movies (2015's San Andreas with Dwayne Johnson, the two Norwegian ""The Wave"" and ""The Quake"" to name a few), but of all I've seen, I haven't happened to find one where the main characters actually stay calm from the get-go. Like in an earthquake scenario, if a rock falls on some dude and he's instantly dead, everyone around just goes into panic mode 11 - nobody seems to keep their cool and think logically. 

Is there a catastrophe film out there where people actually don't panic, and in stead just acknowledges the fact that things are goin' down the drain, but stay calm throughout? That would be an interesting take, I think. 

Kinda like \*ground's shaking, massive earthquake\* and people are just like ""oh ok"" in stead of ""AAAAAAH""

"Argument: Tom Cruise is a method actor  **Not clickbait. And no, I won't take a side on whether or not he is a good dramatic actor, not here. I am here to argue that in doing what he does as a stunt performer, he has elevated himself to the level of a method actor. This argument hinges on a distinction between two levels of method acting.**

**So, my argument is that what most people think of as method acting (MA) has at least two levels to it. And my opinion here is that Tom Cruise embraces one of these, but not the other. But before I do this, I want you to consider an analogy.**

**Consider a world without the word ‚Äúinstrumental artist‚Äù. A world where to be a musical artist involved either just singing, or both singing and playing an instrument. Songs with just singing and no instruments were normal, and so were songs with both instruments and singing. Now, in this world, you can imagine all the semantic pedantic debates about whether (what we call ‚Äúinstrumental artists‚Äù) are truly artists? I argue that Tom Cruise is a method actor in one of two levels, in the same way that Mozart is an artist in one of two levels.**

**So, there are two levels of method acting. Some do either, some do both. Both are method acting. The two levels of MA are the dramatic and the technical. In the same sense that the two levels of music are singing and playing instruments. What Heath Ledger did as Joker was mostly dramatic MA, since he had to alter his personality to play this character. However, there was little technical MA; he didn‚Äôt have to learn any skills or techniques, beyond what you see in normal acting. Heath Ledger is like a singer who doesn‚Äôt play an instrument. What Tom Cruise is doing in Mission Impossible etc. is technical method acting, he‚Äôs drilling his stunts down to his very own art. He goes beyond any regular stunt performer in doing so, especially when you consider 1) the immense scale of his stunts (driving a motorcycle off a cliff and skydiving down the mountain), and 2) the insane amount of training that goes into that (500 skydives, 13.000 motor cross jumps, in this example). This is not just a regular stunt performance; it is a highly elevated form of stunt performing. By analogy, Tom is like an instrumental artist who doesn‚Äôt sing. Finally, we have DDL, who often embraces both levels. He does dramatic MA in the form of becoming narcissists, athletes, mob leaders etc. but also technical MA in the form of tailoring, slaughtering, boxing, etc. By analogy, DDL is like an artist who both sings and plays instruments.**

**So, in the same way we can say that Heath Ledger‚Äôs Joker was methodical in the dramatic but not the technical sense, we can say that Tom Cruise is doing the opposite. Joker is method acting because it goes way beyond what you expect from regular acting, in terms of scale and dedication. And we all know the emotional lengths Heath went to play this character. Conversely, in dedicating his whole life to just drilling down stunts on the motorcycle, jet plane, helicopter, etc. and doing so in a way that goes way beyond most method actors: Tom Cruise is very much a technical method actor.**

**Someone may point out that while Ledger and DDL are performing off-camera, Cruise is not. Some may also argue that Cruise is just doing what other stunt performers also do. Or that what he is doing is not the same as becoming a character through ordinary method acting. These claims are demonstrably false. The training for MI7 involved 2 WHOLE YEARS of Tom Cruise doing absolutely nothing else but just constantly training things like motocross, skydiving, and a niece extreme sport called a speed flying (extremely deadly btw). So, he is immersing himself into these stunts behind the screen, and to a scale and with a dedication that few other stunt performers can match. In doing these skydives and motocross jumps, he is gradually becoming the Ethan Hunt we see in Dead Reckoning. The dramatic focus, vigor, calm and competence we see from Ethan Hunt in the movie, was developed through Cruise performing the stunts that generate such emotions in the first place.**

**He's not just crashing cars or jumping down stairs. And he's not just doing the stunts that are on his payroll. And in the same way that DDL's acting made it actionable for the director to elevate most of his films to a level that was otherwise impossible with regular actors; McQuarrie is allowed to do exactly that through the methods of Cruise.**

**Something else to point out, is that Cruise is not some type of athlete who practices stunts for a separate sport, and gets hired to do these types of film jobs occasionally. He was not a jet pilot before Top Gun, and he was not a helicopter pilot before Fallout. All these films involved Cruise BECOMING Ethan Hunt/ Maverick, over the course of months or years. So, he's not just an ordinary physical/ stunt performer. He is training and performing, exclusively to perform these roles, and to a completely unparalleled level.**

**Folks, say whatever you want about his apparent/ alleged personality disorder, religious extremism, horrendous family life, etc. Tom Cruise is a method actor in the technical sense. I am a massive fan of DDL, but there is no debating that what Tom is doing goes leagues ahead of DDL sitting in a wheelchair, tailoring or sparring. Tom Cruise may not be the most impressive dramatic actor, let alone a dramatic MA (like DDL). He may never be. However, I argue that he is a one-of-a-kind sole-technical method actor.**

"Movie Recommendation/Review: Subservience (2024) TL;DR: Solid performances by the cast pull us into another futuristic story of AI going wrong. Familiar themes done in a believable and entertaining way.

The Good: 
1. The cast: It‚Äôs easy to sympathize with the family. Michele Morrone, Madeline Zima, and Matilda Firth have great chemistry, and Jude Greenstein rounds out the family as the ridiculously adorable baby. Megan Fox is perfect as the AI Alice. She plays into the ‚Äúbad/robotic‚Äù acting criticism she‚Äôs previously received by literally playing a robot under synthetic human skin. And she completely pulls it off.
2. The story: The family keeps us invested. It‚Äôs easy to root for them the entire movie. The themes of being a good parent/spouse, challenges of raising children, fear of being replaced, power dynamics, infidelity, and dealing with sickness and external threats to family members were all done well.
3. The effects: While it‚Äôs no major blockbuster in terms of effects, what they did use was effective. There weren‚Äôt any moments of noticeably bad CGI that can often pull people out of a movie.

The Bad:
1. This movie surprised me with how entertaining it was. I enjoyed it so much that I may not have noticed little things that may have bothered others.

The Ugly:
1. The realization of how common sex with robots would become. Especially in the scenario where they look and act like humans.

"I consider Harrison Ford's role in Ender's Game to be one of his standout performances. &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d79o5vnrciyd1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f06413437213e1bda54ae3ed2e9d722a838acf2

Movie premise: Reeling from a failed alien invasion, Earth recruits child prodigies to mould into strategists in order to repel the next one.

Harrison Ford plays Colonel Graff, the guy de facto in charge of Earth's military and the space station where the kids are being trained into child soldiers.

The film is adapted from a book, but it's of the classic sci-fi persuasion rather than YA. There is no ""my green eyes flashed as I decided how to rebel against the system and choose which of my two friends I was in love with"".

It doesn't get much chatter, and I doubt Ford considered it much beyond the paycheck but he really stood out to me in the film.

Graff is a character who has completely accepted that the ends justify the means. In a war where the loser goes extinct, it doesn't matter how you achieve victory. If you win, then you can have your accountability and justice afterwards, but if you lose, nothing will matter. I was totally convinced that Ford's character saw the children as nothing but tools, to be tested to destruction if necessary. He berates, he manipulates, everything is about the mission. The only time he lets a crack show is the shouting match he and the protagonist have after victory is achieved.

The character also suits Harrison Ford's strengths. He's ornery and stand-offish and he snaps at people. He's not required to do physical work, simply fill the room with an intimidating presence just by standing still.",normal

Fast forward to the celebration scene, same location. Imagine this: all the VIPs and politicians are there‚Ä¶ and when chaos breaks out, the guards don‚Äôt even have guns? Okay, let‚Äôs say guns aren‚Äôt allowed. But why did it take so long for the police to arrive? Or why wasn‚Äôt there any police presence at all when Rana Singh was there? The scenes were just so illogical by that point.

Then, imagine this again: Chaos is happening, and Rana decides to go up the elevator? Wouldn‚Äôt you try to leave the building? Okay, maybe going up is safer for a quick helicopter escape. But why did it take so long for them to get on the helicopter? And the ending was terrible‚Äîwhy was Baba Shakti just waiting in the VVIP room? It was so laughable. What a waste of a movie. It was good but ruined at the end.",normal

Others may prefer other rules, but as everytime, I ask you to take note of the following remarks:

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

"Pearl (2022) is one of the best female characters done right in film (In my opinion, at least)  
  
She was imperfect, she was relatable (while very unhinged), not to mention that it's really refreshing to see female sexuality expressed in film in a non ""virginal"" way. Pearl had desires, dreams, selfish and understandable ones, and while she yearned for love, her heart was ultimately crushed by more than a romance gone wrong (there's nothing wrong with that, of course, but in terms of female portrayal in film, it's a bit overplayed). Pearl's dynamic with power, going from a farm girl dictated by her strict mother + the (financial) dependency on men (e.g. Howard), to a killer and head of the household, was also interesting and authentic to witness. 

And her monologue toward the end of the film is the cherry on top. Could rewatch that scene over and over </3",normal

"My Go-to Sci-Fi, Horror, Giallo Double Feature List I love curating a double feature, so much that I still think fondly of the many viewing parties I did in my old apartment of 1975's *Grey Gardens* with the 2009 TV Movie, pairing the real with the fiction.

To a gamut of genres and sub-genres, when I just need four hours of film with stylistic, visual or thematic consistency, these are my go-to double features that nobody asked for (keep in mind, the order below is the order I would watch them):

* *Passion* (2012, Brian De Palma) and *Neon Demon (*2016, Nicolas Winding Refn): the category is a psychological horror with lesbian revenge undertones all packaged in a muted yet saturated (IYKYK) visual style that the two both do well. They also package the misogyny and jealousy of hating another woman with the attraction of hating a woman, obviously with very different plots and one with a more fantastical plot than the other, but the same grapevine, in my opinion.
* *Who Saw Her Die* (1972, Aldo Lado and Vittorio De Sisti) and *Don't Look Now (*1973, Nicolas Roeg): the latter is very much inspired by the former, both set in Venice, I like seeing these as ""horror tourism"" since they do capture Venice, Italy quite nicely as a place to go; and beauty of Venice in the 70s. The theme of murder and abduction is similar, but the difference between the Italian and American remakes with Donald Sutherland is a neat cultural comparison.
* *Unbreakable* (2000, M. Night Shyamalan) and *Malignant (*2021, James Wan): both have twists, and both include the concept of the weak versus able-bodied. Both view supernatural abilities through this lens of medical conditions or ""disorder.""
* *I Know Who Killed Me* (2007, Chris Sivertson) and *Death Walks at Midnight* (1972, Luciano Ercoli): a modern Giallo versus traditional Giallo style that is more similar than you think: my crash course double feature to Giallo newbies without being super on the nose with an Argento choice. First, for millennials, choosing a Giallo-style film with Lindsay Lohan gets people raising an eye. Then, with *Death Walks*, you can note the similar themes between the two movies: a memorable murder weapon, supernatural undertones for both films and the big thing that I think people always forget what makes Giallo a Giallo is that there needs to be an ongoing police investigation and police presence, which both movies have.
* *The Island* (2005, Michael Bay) and *Total Recall* (2012, Len Wiseman): my go-to science fiction, attractive leads, blockbuster, medical science genre of action flicks that I think pair well together. When you just want to watch pretty people move, and some stuff blows up, they both deal with ""light themes"" of medical advancement consistent with a future dystopia.
* *Lucy* (2014, Luc Besson) and *Limitless* (2011, Neil Burger) are movies in which the drug enhances the abilities of the protagonists but also kills them. In my opinion, the male protagonist version and the female protagonist version are the yin and yang of this particular genre of designer drugs-creating superheroes.

That's it for now; I have more, but I am happy to hear other people's recommendations; also, any academic insight like I did would be cool. But I'm a nerd, and I sometimes enjoy the motive of a double feature more than the actual viewing.",normal

Kiefer Sutherland and JK Simmons are a little underused i would say since both have great scenes.

"The Substance is a masterclass in Psychological Horror.  First of all, I believe that Demi Moore deserves major Kudos for taking on a role that directly confronts the ideals of her own industry. Imperfections aside, this movie crafts an allegory of aging that feels disturbingly resonant, reminding us of the value of embracing mortality and the dignity of aging gracefully. Moore really put on an arresting performance embodying the journey from an attractive rising star to an aging icon whose name is etched on Hollywood boulevard but who now fades into the background, overlooked and forgotten. 

I cannot help but see haunting parallels with society‚Äôs obsession with plastic surgeries, BBLs, Liposuctions and the relentless pursuit of perfection. The way this addiction is portrayed feels grounded in reality, it mirrors the way we become trapped, wanting more and more, reshaping ourselves until we lose touch of our own identity.

 The finale of this movie is quite shocking and purposefully grotesque, a horror that captures the inevitable consequence of rejecting natural aging, I believe this was the director‚Äôs way of showing the horror that comes from refusing to accept natural aging, it‚Äôs as if the very essence of this pursuit morphs into a monster, a distorted version of humanity driven by an insatiable hunger for youth. It is what happens when society pushes the pursuit of beauty to the extreme, feeding an addiction that ultimately consumes the person entirely. 

Dennis Quad‚Äôs performance brought a sort of intensity here that was quite raw and very unsettling (the shrimp scene will stay with me for a while), a character that is basically caught in his moral decay. His character resembles the darker side of ambition, where success and status take precedence over humanity. He is basically the representation of the dark underbelly of Hollywood. A person that has no loyalty, no support and no care for what happens when people are valued only for their looks which in turn creates a desperation to remain relevant. 

The moral of the story here is simple, our fixation on outward beauty can turn us into monsters. This movie wasn‚Äôt just horror for the sake of horror but uses the genre to make a powerful statement about the obsession with youth and lengths people go to defy aging. It left me with a deeply thought provoking experience, an unforgettable reminder on cultural addiction that leaves us questioning our own views on age and beauty. An experience I will revisit again.

"Joy Ride (2001) is pretty fun but hilariously stupid  There's a 2001 movie called Joy Ride that stars Paul Walker and Steve Zahn.  I'm pretty sure I never watched this again after I first saw it in the mid 2000s.  I vaguely remember having a fun time with it, and I just had decent fun watching it tonight (a few spurts of not paying much attention) on Hulu

But lol you really gotta let go with the suspension of disbelief.  Back in a world where GPS for cars and smartphones didn't exist, this random redneck truck driver had like James Bond, Ethan Hunt levels of surveillance and tracking skills.  Actually not even the same, it was just impossibly inexplicable.  After like the third successful stalking on the road over days, he somehow finds out who LeeLee Sobieski's (who Paul and Steve had literally just picked up) random friend is.  A girl who went off to some undisclosed location after a minute of screen time early in the movie.  Somehow, somewhere, kidnaps her.  He then kidnaps LeeLee as well and the movie ends with him getting ahead on the road to set up an elaborate trap/fake death 

Actually, now that I think about it, it would've been hilarious if when he revealed himself to be still alive at the very end, he says 'I have a particular set of skills'

"Nightmare Alley had one of the most depressing endings I've ever seen I just saw this movie and holy shit. What a brutal fucking ending. Bradley Cooper is a damn amazing actor, that's for sure. I'm surprised he wasn't nominated for this. His reaction in the last shot was just haunting.

That ending made perfect sense though. His character deserved it, given how he kept going further and further off the deep end, all for the sake of the grift, to the point where he killed two people. I should've seen it coming; the fact that he went from a wealthy mentalist to the type of person that was pitied and looked down upon the most. That was a real gut punch, especially considering how that geek was treated in the beginning, which Stan witnessed up close. It brought it all full-circle.

That said, this movie was good but not great. The second act was too bloated, and could've been at least 15 minutes shorter. There should've been less scenes with Cate Blanchett's character, as Stan's relationship with her just wasn't very deep or interesting. Plus it essentially led to nothing given how she betrays him in the end. It should've focused more on Rooney Mara's character and their relationship. Not to mention the judge's wife's murder-suicide?!? WTF? So random.

In the end, I still recommend this movie, despite it's 2.5-hour runtime. If for nothing else than that brutal and rather demeaning ending.",normal

"Parasite and Saltburn  Saltburn seems like a spin-off of Parasite. Some of the artistic and haunting elements present in Parasite were replaced with trendy and violent images in Saltburn.

It is hard for me to not compare the two, I loved the understated themes in Parasite and think it was a better made film while Saltburn has insane music and visual elements that really elevate it. I think ethnicity has something to do with it but that exacerbates the issue, Parasite should be celebrated beyond Saltburn as it came first. ",normal
"Movies which intelligently critique modern democracy (such as Starship Troopers) AFAIK the only ones in my repertoire which offer any kind of meaningful critique about modern democracy are Starship Troopers and its third sequel. Can't think of any that would be rebellious enough to challenge our philosophy of things. Sure there are many flicks that latently explore social injustice and relative poverty or replace it with absurdist extremes. But this is precisely about ones that really strip our ethics down and ask hard questions. Also aliens, that is always a plus.

Everything we see in movies as westerners is repetitive, aggressive, mindless promotion of democracy. This is different from other cultures. Some revel in their ideas of leader worship and ruthless violence. But on the same hand, there's no comprehension in movies of democratic propaganda. Or democratic terrorism. These things simply ""do not compute"". So there is the irony.

"Who is this generation's 'Stanley Kubrick'? In terms of style and vision Spielberg was seen as Kubrick's natural successor, but I just don't think his projects were consistent enough to be put in contention. There's a lot of droopy baggage in his filmography.  Plus, he's arguably the generation after Kubrick, before this one.

Arguably, Christopher Nolan in terms of scope of vision and genre. He's known for a mix of science fiction and historical epics. Like, Kubrick. Although, their tone is very different. Nolan is less acerbic. 

In terms of having a dark comical slant. You could point to this year The Substance by Coralie Fargeat. It will be interesting to see what she does next. I can imagine she will have a lot of freedom to do something just as bonkers and disturbing. Or, maybe she will surprise us and do something different like Kubrick.

"Great scary movie for a couple that doesn't like scary movies? My wife is having a weak moment and asked if I wanted to watch a scary movie. Challenge accepted. :/

Here are some criteria that might help:

- nothing involving religion or satanism
- no excess gore
- could prob handle a little more than Poltergeist 
- Get Out was good
- I watched Midsommar on a plane and that type is a no-go
- looking to get scared not grossed out or psychologically rocked

"What are you favorite unsettling movies or scenes where nothing really happens? For example, almost the entirety of the movie Cure is so unsettling but you can't really put your finger on why, it just has a paranoid feeling and you're constantly looking in all corners of the screen to see what might be hiding.

Other examples would be films like The Shining, I'm Thinking of Ending Things, or most of David Lynch's work but in particular the diner scene in Mulholland Drive, or the ghost reveal scene in Pulse (by the same director as Cure.)

What are some other examples of unnerving scenes that get under your skin?

"The Garbage Pail Kids Movie shows the normal humans were right to be disgusted by the monster kids  This rant will contain spoilers for a more than forty year old movie. You have found the thread made by the one person in the world who is gonna write this serious essay on a silly children's movie no one has seen.Oh yeah.

The Garbage Pail Kids Movie is regarded as one of the worst movies ever made, due to the gross monster Kids, bad special effects, and ridiculous dialogue. It's not available to stream anywhere, and that's unlikely to change anytime soon because there's a reboot on the way. But having finally watched it for free on a site, I just want to say the thing I found most horrible about this children's movie.

That is, the movie has a good message about opposing bigotry and not judging people by how they look...but they completely botch it by making the Garbage Kids monsters worthy of hate & disgust. ‚ÄãThroughout the movie, we are told that the poor Garbage Kids have to stay hidden in a little shop, because normal humans will attack them for being different. Normal humans are called ""Normies"" by the monsters & the movie constantly lectures that Normies are cruel & judgmental to anything ugly or gross. Only the main human boy (who is bullied) and the wise man who keeps the monster kids hidden in the shop are portrayed as tolerant and good at the start of the film.

The boy gets the idea to teach the world that the monsters are good, by having them put on a fashion show to the public. They invite several beautiful women to pose as models in the beautiful ‚Äãclothes that the monsters make - though it should be noted the models don't know anything about who made the clothes, this will come up again later. The boy helps the monsters get out of the shop so they can have fun in the Normie world. They are told to be careful, because normal humans are mean, something like that.

Only...

This is the part of the movie where the people making it decided to be goofy and show off all the gross things the Garbage Pail Kids can do. There is a¬†Missie, a girl monster with a constantly runny nose who can sneeze a flood of snot, Windy Winston, a boy monster ho wears a Hawaiian shirt and often farts great visible cloud of gas violently; Valerie Vomit, a girl who throws up on command; Foul Phil, a whining hungry baby with who constantly asks characters if they are his ""mommy"" or ""daddy""; Nat Nerd, an¬†obese-acne riddled boy who dresses up like a superhero and wets his pants frequently; and on and on. All of these are exaggerated with ridiculous special effects. Apparently, because this is a kid's movie, the people making it thought it would be funny to spend forty minutes in the middle of the movie having these little monsters run around sneezing special effects snot showers, farting clouds of gas, and peeing on normies.

Now, there ARE bullies and an evil police force that attack the monsters for being ugly - I'm not defending them. They are the villains and get what they deserve. They are not justified.

But there are several scenes where the Garbage Kids harass normal humans for no reason, and we are supposed to laugh and be on the Kids side. It's all played for laughs - nearly an hour in the second act of gag after gag. In one scene, The Garbage ‚ÄãKids walk into a movie theater crowded with normal humans. The humans don't attack or harass the Kids, they just keep watching the film. ‚ÄãThe Garbage Kids start being obnoxious. One of them steal an old woman's hot dog when she isn't noticing. Another steals a young woman's hot dog, and she notices, and her boyfriend is about to punch the thief, when he's ganged up on by another Garbage Pail Kid. Then Missy (the girl monster) comes into the theater with popcorn and sneezes a shower of snot all over the women and men in the room, causing all the normal humans to flee in disgust and horror. The main boy of the movie doesn't ever rebuke the monster kids for this, he says he's glad they had fun & hopes to let them out again.

Then the bully boy, the villain of the film with the help of a traitor steal the dresses that the Garbage Pail Kids made for the upcoming fashion show. Not because he wants to wear the dresses himself, but so he and his partner can get credit for making these dresses when the beautiful human models wear them at the fashion show.

In the third act of the movie, the Garbage Pail Kids crash the fashion show, take out the bully, and...attack the women models. Yep, you read that right. In an attempt to show maybe that looks don't make you good or bad, the director decided to have his ""hero"" ugly monster kids chase beautiful normal human models around for the climax. But these models aren't the villains! They were contacted to wear he dresses for the fashion show that the boy himself helped set up, and that's what they are doing! Yet now our hero leads the monster kids in a ""payback"" attack on the very models for the event he helped organize! We're supposed to think it's justified due to the villain stealing credit and hosting the show once the models arrived. ‚Äã

I walked away thinking that the Garbage Pail Kids monsters are a bunch of obnoxious thugs completely deserving of the fear and contempt most normal humans have of them.",normal

"Love everything? - Everything Everywhere All at Once Review *\&quot;The one who loves the most regrets the most.\&quot;*

::: spoiler I haven‚Äôt seen an infectiously energetic movie like this one since Scott Pilgrim vs. The World but while that movie is so much fun because it has a ridiculous plot and is based on a comic book, this movie isn‚Äôt all just fun.

It‚Äôs also a mature drama about family and listening to other people and our relationships with those closest to us. It could be described as a story taking place entirely around a family dealing with the reality that they could be losing their business soon or it could be described as a affectionate tale of human relationships across all universes, encompassing all the times that anyone or anything has ever lived through or experienced and how at the end, sometimes we forget that people love and care about us and we just see them opposing us because we have been so caught up in our own problems and shut everyone out that maybe we just weren‚Äôt paying attention to how much they were trying to be with us too.

I don‚Äôt know how to explain it because the movie doesn‚Äôt try to either, there are no explanations at the end about the love we feel for eachother and not everything is right, there will still be fighting, there will still be moments where we will hate eachother but ultimately, as long as long we are kind and we listen to eachother, it will be okay. It is okay.

"My favorite scene in Suicide Squad (2016) I‚Äôm not even mad at 2016‚Äôs Suicide Squad. It‚Äôs actually really impressive that they made a movie where every single decision that went into making it was a bad decision. I‚Äôm familiar with the Suicide Squad comics somewhat and one of my back pocket rants is how I would give the movie the script doctor treatment, but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm here to talk about today. I‚Äôm here to talk about the one scene in 2016‚Äôs Suicide Squad that I thought was genuinely not bad, maybe even great if it had been in a better movie.

The first act of Suicide Squad is notoriously bloated, trying and often failing to introduce us to all of the members of the titular suicide squad and explain how Waller managed to get them to agree to be in the squad. The role of Deadshot is played by Will Smith, who I thought was terribly miscast in this movie but who is still Will Smith so the performance is nonetheless not bad. In his recruitment scene, they take Deadshot to a makeshift gun range, with a table full of different guns and several metal targets down range, and instruct him to pick up a gun and show them what he can do. Deadshot picks up a pistol, loads it, and immediately points it at Riggs, the guard who‚Äôd been abusing him for much of stay in prison. There‚Äôs a tense moment where Deadshot speculates that the gun must be loaded with blanks, because they wouldn‚Äôt give a loaded gun to a prisoner like him, but he fires into the air and discovers that the gun is indeed loaded with live ammunition. Deadshot immediately comes alive, pointing the weapon down range and going to town on the target dummies before doing the same with the other weapons on the table. Of course, every shot hits directly in the middle of the forehead, so accurate that he eventually punches holes in the metal.

What I love is that, for a brief second, we get a real glimpse into Deadshot‚Äôs character that we never seem to get anywhere else in the movie, even when they‚Äôre actually trying to tell us about his character. The moment when he realizes he has a real gun loaded with real bullets in his hand, he doesn‚Äôt think of killing Riggs, though he has plenty of reason to do so. Instead, he forgets about everything and is consumed with firing the guns in front of him, with the precision of a pro athlete and the finesse of a paintbrush in the hands of a master painter. This is a man who has mastered the art of gunplay, a man who‚Äôs so skilled with firearms that they are an extension of his will, a means for expression in the same way that Bruce Lee expresses himself through martial arts. Deadshot‚Äôs been in prison and deprived of his tools for so long that when he finally gets a loaded gun in his hand he gets totally consumed with the rush of using his skills again, like a caged cheetah being released so it can run again.

I wish that they had explored Deadshot‚Äôs character more, maybe explored exactly how much he thinks of himself as either a simple mercenary doing a job or a psychopathic man who just really loves shooting people. I wish that they‚Äôd let Deadshot‚Äôs character just be who he is instead of forcing him into the mold of a classic Will Smith ‚Äúfather with a heart of gold‚Äù character. I wish they had done a lot of things differently when they made Suicide Squad the movie. But this is one scene in a bad movie that I did not hate, and in fact actually made me light up with the potential of what the movie could have been.",normal

"Confusion with Source code (2011) I know I'm 13 yrs too late to watch it. It has been on my watchlist for long. It's a beautiful Sci-Fi movie with beautiful ending. The thing I don't understand is:  
What I  anticipated from the description of SC from Dr. Rutledge, SC ,with some tech gizmo can create a simulation  of the world from the last 8 minutes of the brain of a dying body. Assuming they scanned every brain on that train they were able to create such detailed sim. (also the  event that Sean Fentress probably didn't witness). Even that doesn't explain how the sim. got the details of the Nuclearbomb planted in the van. Nobody on the train could have known that.",normal

"Looking for movies about paranormal investigators I'm looking for movies about paranormal investigators. Movies with a serious tone, not necessarily slow-burn, with good cinematography similar to the Conjuring series, The Innkeepers, Exhuma, The Ninth Gate, Red Lights, Constantine (2005), which feature paranormal investigators as protagonists. They can be realistic or not. I'm also interested in films with regular detectives investigating the paranormal, like the series Twin Peaks, The X-Files,  and the movies Longlegs and The Wailing.

Also they can be involving fictional organizations that investigate the paranormal like the Dharma Initiative in the Lost series.

Anything about poltergeists, ghosts, UFOs and aliens, parallel dimensions, spirits, unexplainable forces, occult, parapsychology, including both supernatural and paranormal elements. 

Also in the style of Alan Wake and Control games.

I'm also open (not so open) to movies with a more comedic tone, like Ghostbusters, The Frighteners, Men in Black? and the Dirk Gently series, they still need to have a spooky atmosphere. However, I really prefer films with a more serious tone.

Hope you got what i am searching for.

Please NOT found footage horror films, i hate that style of directing",normal

"Movies that make you feel nostalgic, for a place you'd never even visited? I only recently watched Bloodsport in its entirety. Growing up in the 90s, the VHS was always playing at my relatives home, and always caught glimpses of it but never really watched it. The other day I was bored as heck and put it on. 

It really scratched that nostalgic itch I was having. The shots captured in film of the Hong Kong landscape really did it for me, it reminds me of a time that has long gone. The busy streets and large electronics store signs.

Watching movies like Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, Goonies never made me feel nostalgic or scratch that itch for me. Maybe because I grew up in a busy cosmopolitan environment (I know Ghostbusters is set in the city). It's weird, because those movies were big in the early 90s when I was growing up. 

Contrastingly, Jackie Brown had the same effect on me. I only watched it last week and I can't get it out of my mind. I put it on because I had some time away from the kids and I told myself rather than scrolling endlessly trying to pick a movie, I'll watch the first film that pops up on my streaming service. And boy am I glad I did.",normal

"Favorite movie by european country: Bulgaria Hello there,

today I'm a bit early, but I'm going on a trip and the ""election trend"" is very clear: In view of the Oscars, it probably comes as no surprise to many that  ***–ù–∏—á–∏—ò–∞ –∑–µ–º—ô–∞*** (in engl. *No Man's Land)* wins the title as your ‚Äòfavourite movie set in Bosnia & Herzegovina‚Äô by a wide margin.

In alphabetical order, Bulgaria is the next country to follow today, and I think it could be very exciting to find the most popular movie set in this country, too. To ensure that everything runs smoothly, I would ask you to take note of the following remarks:

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

"I'm surprised that Terminator 1 is not the favourite! I watched Terminator 1 and 2 and the first one knocks the second one easily out of the park in terms of atmosphere, soundtrack and suspense.

The second feels like a michael bay action movie that you have seen hundred times before, its fun yeah, but nothing unique, Terminator 1 feels truly unique.

The first movie does a far better job as portraying the terminator as a serious threat.

"Passengers had so much potential but it just slowly devolved into trash [Spoiler review] Spoiler review/rant, so if you for some reason want to see it first, don't proceed further.

This movie had such an interesting premise. The first half an hour was honestly pretty damn good, before it hits you that they kinda don't know how to expand on it. Because honestly it kinda IS hard to expand on the story in a setting that doesn't change much, by nature.

The movie presents us with a very flawed protagonist, but that's good! Having a flaw as gigantic as subjecting Aurora to his fate just so he would feel less lonely, is pretty interesting and leaves a lot of room to grow and to have some fascinating discussion.

The part where they're dating feels scummy, and I thought it was intentionally so, but given the rest of the movie, it seems like the writers totally wanted us to see it as romantic and cute, and if that's the case then EWWWWW. Jim pretty much took Aurora's life and agency away from her and they want us to be happy about them dating now? Eventually Aurora finds out and is totally pissed off, and that's the only cathartic part of the movie (and even that's undermined later). She doesn't want anything to do with him and spends most ify her time on the other side of the ship. 

Eventually, the Captain (I think he was named Gus?) wakes up and that's the turning point where they introduce more of the plot. The ship is having a breakdown and they have to fix it before the 5000 passengers die. However, after like 15 minutes, Gus fucking dies so he's really just more of a plot device to give the main characters access to the crew/staff rooms. Shame, because he might have expanded greatly on the dynamic. Then they shoot his corpse into space for some reason? Come on, guys, maybe the crew would've wanted to give him proper burial on Homestead 2? I don't recall him saying he wants his corpse to float in interplanetary space for an eternity so it's another decision that feels un-consensual. 

Finally there's the climax where Jim almost sacrifices himself, etc. Not much to say here, other than that the use of the Law of Conversation of Momentum was pretty clever, I liked that. A lot of space movies don't acknowledge that throwing something heavy in space will provide force on yourself in the opposite direction. 

Aurora revives Jim, and here comes the ending, that is just the dumbest part of the whole movie. Jim figures out a way to put someone into cryo-sleep using the Auto-Doctor. However THERE'S ONLY 1 AUTO-DOCTOR ON THE ENTIRE SHIP, that houses FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. Putting aside that the ""emotional"" finale hinges itself on the dumbest thing ever, Jim offers Aurora to freeze her so she can have her life back. However, for some reason she loves him again and actually wants to die with him on the ship. Wtf? This was an opportunity for Jim to actually redeem himself, sacrifice the life he could've had so he could give Aurora hers back. Aurora, still hating him, would've accepted and later wrote about him in an article retelling the story, as the flawed individual he was, but who ultimately saved the ship and redeemed himself in the end. BUT NOOOOOOO, THEY'RE IN LOVEEE!!! 

So anyway, we have a flashback to the future and they planted a bunch of trees in the hall, recorded a bunch of messages for the passengers and presumably died. They didn't show *how* they died tho, altough it would be funny to just see a pair of skeletons chilling in the cafeteria. But like, did they die of old age? And if so, they didn't die at the same exact time, did they? Once one of them died, the other one didn't really have anything holding them there and could've put themselves to sleep in the auto-doctor??? So yeah, confused-ass movie, with a weird-ass ending.

Sorry for my rant, but I just wanted to get my thoughts out and see what's the general consensus on the movie.",normal

"About The Thing (1982): Did Garry forget he gave the keys to Windows the day before? During the ""Sombody got to the blood!"" scene...when Mac asked Garry who else could have used the key, Garry responded with ""Nobody! I give it to Copper whenever he needs it!""

Just the day before Windows had the keys with him and dropped them when he found Bennings getting assimilated.

"SPECTRAL (2016) - A forgettable, but not bad Movie! https://preview.redd.it/ajiwm4or49yd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=31ebf8cfc3ae6a9df60684e09b073f2e7e530f1c

***Spectral*** from 2016 is a movie, which as of right now is available on Netflix, that many people might have missed, and it‚Äôs understandable. It‚Äôs one of those films that‚Äôs forgettable, yet manages to still be somewhat enjoyable. However, i can assure you it won¬¥t go in the ""forgettable"" Camp like ***Dwayne Johnson¬¥s*** ***Rampage***).

I stumbled upon it back when i first got Netflix, around 2015 or so, and it became one of the earliest, or maybe first movies i watched on this platform. Since that first viewing, i‚Äôve come back to it maybe four times. Yet, oddly enough, each time i rewatch it, i seem to forget many parts of it and especially how exactly the finale unfolds.

The premise of ***Spectral*** is one of those science fiction setups that‚Äôs both intriguing and familiar. The story follows a team of soldiers, scientists, and engineers as they investigate mysterious, ghostly apparitions that have begun to kill people in a war-torn Eastern European City. While the story leans heavily on Sci-Fi and war movie tropes, it does enough to set itself apart with an air of mystery around these spectral entities. It has a unique twist, but admittedly, not groundbreaking or especially innovative.

One of ***Spectral's*** surprising strengths is it¬¥s CGI. The visual effects are well done, it brings a lot of atmosphere, adding a otherworldly feel to the visuals, which would probably be harder to pull off with practical effects.

The cast and performances is solid.  
***James Badge Dale*** takes the lead, and while his role isn‚Äôt going to win any awards, he does a good job carrying the movie. The supporting cast fills in their roles well too, though none of them particularly stand out to me in terms of character development or memorable moments. They serve the plot without drawing too much attention to themselves, which is fitting for a movie of this genre but may contribute to why ***Spectral*** tends to be easily forgotten.

The Soundtrack was written by the infamous Tom Holkenborg (aka Junkie XL), but i didn¬¥t really managed to hear any standout cues in it. It mostly just plays in the background (which is the point, isn¬¥t it?).

So at least, ***Spectral*** in the end is a fun, but sadly ultimately forgettable ride. It doesn‚Äôt do anything to redefine Sci-Fi or military action, but it doesn‚Äôt do anything particularly wrong either. If you‚Äôre in the mood for a visually engaging action thriller with a Sci-Fi twist, it‚Äôs a solid choice that‚Äôs likely worth a rewatch or two. But if you‚Äôre looking for something that leaves a lasting impact on you or a complex storyline, ***Spectral*** might not fully deliver.",normal

"Any interest for a Book Club for Movies? I'd like to make some friends on here to watch movies with. I thought a sort of movie book club would be a cool way to connect with people and learn more about film.

The idea: group members can recommend a movie, (doesn't have to be one you've seen! It can be whatever you're interested in seeing) and the group can vote on what movie to watch out of the recommendations. Once or twice a week (or however often everyone would like), we can watch it and talk about it :) we could maybe do a Movie A and Movie B, so if the Movie of the Week doesn't appeal to you, you've got at least another option. I'd watch pretty much anything, be it horror, action, comedy, black & white, silent, anything! So far it's just me and a dream so it's whatever works, really.

Film connoisseurs and casual viewers alike are welcome. Just don't expect everyone to have the same opinion. We want different opinions! Without them, there'd be no reason for a group!

"Francis Ford Coppola to Receive AFI Life Achievement Award ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù trilogy and ‚ÄúApocalypse Now‚Äù filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola will be the 50th recipient of the AFI Life Achievement Award.

The American Film Institute (AFI) Board of Trustees announced that Coppola will presented the award ‚Äî the institution‚Äôs highest honor for a career in film ‚Äî during a gala tribute ceremony held at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on April 26, 2025.

‚ÄúFrancis Ford Coppola is a peerless artist ‚Äî one who has created seminal works in the canon of American film, and has also inspired generations of filmmakers who now embody his artistry and his independent spirit,‚Äù stated Kathleen Kennedy, chair of the AFI board of trustees.

Coppola is a six-time Academy Award-winning writer, director and producer (including the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award from the AMPAS board of governors), with an acclaimed filmography that also includes ‚ÄúThe Conversation,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Outsiders‚Äù and ‚ÄúBram Stoker‚Äôs Dracula.‚Äù Coppola‚Äôs latest film ‚ÄúMegalopolis,‚Äù launched earlier this year at the Cannes Film Festival and was released theatrically and in Imax globally this fall. Three of his films, ‚ÄúThe Godfather,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Godfather Part II‚Äù and ‚ÄúApocalypse Now‚Äù rank among AFI‚Äôs ‚Äú100 Years‚Ä¶ 100 Movies‚Äù list, as well as Variety‚Äôs 100 best films list.

As the co-founder of American Zoetrope with George Lucas, Coppola‚Äôs impact can also be measured by the careers of the filmmakers he‚Äôs supported (including Carroll Ballard, John Milius and Sofia Coppola, his daughter) as well as actors such as Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, James Caan, Harrison Ford, Richard Dreyfus, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Matt Dillon, Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne.

Established in 1973, the AFI Life Achievement Award is presented to a single honoree ‚Äúwhose talent has in a fundamental way advanced the film art; whose accomplishment has been acknowledged by scholars, critics, professional peers and the general public; and whose work has stood the test of time.‚Äù Recent recipients include Nicole Kidman (2024), Julie Andrews (2022), Denzel Washington (2019), George Clooney (2018) and Diane Keaton (2017).

The AFI Life Achievement Award Tribute special will air on TNT, with encore presentations on Turner Classic Movies (TCM).

"The Invisible Man (1933) has aged ridiculously well. What an exciting Sci-Fi movie. Claude Rains acted his heart out I just finished this and was blown away. It was so cool. And the pacing is perfect. A 70 minute little sci-fi/horror treat.


This movie lives and dies by the performance of it's titular lead, the Invisible Man, Jack Griffin himself, and Claude Rains absolutely delivers on that front. He's unhinged, charismatic and also sympathetic. And all that from physical acting and voice work. Also the costume rules. The bandage and glasses combo is so good.


I didn't know the story of the Invisible Man. I'm intrigued to check out the source material. What a clever and horrifying story about being invisible. The chaos escalate really quickly. 


The cinematography and effects look amazing too. It's really fun to think about how they managed to do all those special effects almost 90 years ago and try to figure out some of the tricks.


I saw The Mummy 1932 a while ago as well, that one was pretty good too, but this might be my favourite 30's monster movie.

"Rambo movies / fan discussion I'm watching the whole Rambo series today for the 2nd time this year. Additionally, I'm seeing Bullet To The Head because it should be a Rambo movie so I'm including it in my marathon. None of the movies are junk and can be rewatched many times and so if there's a Bluray or DVD box set I am intent on buying it someday soon.  My ratings on these movies mirror how much I like them, so, as you can guess the 10/10 ratings are my favorites.

First Blood (1982) 10/10

Rambo: First Blood Part II  (1985) 7/10

Rambo III (1988) 8/10

Rambo (2008) 10/10

Bullet to the Head (2012) 10/10

Rambo: Last Blood (2019) 8/10

Why was Rambo abandoned in the 1990s? I'm sure the series could have been continued but there's a huge 20 year gap between #3 and #4.  What are your favorite things about the Rambo movies? Favorite sequences, etc.

"Would anyone like to watch and discuss movies?  I'm a film lover that's big into horror, but I enjoy all types of film and would like to broaden my horizons. I'd like to start a group where we all share recommendations, then watch and discuss. Or, in the case of some movies, watch in disgust.

My idea: each week (or however often you'd like), we can vote on a movie from a list of recommendations made by the group, watch it, and talk about it. Any genre, any era, black & white, silent, or released two months ago. Anything goes!

If a movie isn't for you, maybe we can have Movie A and Movie B to choose from. I just want a casual community for film fanatics and the average viewer alike. Everyone is welcome! Just don't condemn anybody for having an opinion, because that's kinda the whole idea ;)

If that sounds cool, leave a comment or shoot me a DM!


Much love!

"What are some of the movies you regret watching with your friends/family? I watched Hereditary with my friends, i regret it so much. Its supposed to be a really good movie, but the experience spoiled it. The constant questions, making jokes in some of the most climax scenes. Like dude.. just watch it. ""It wasnt that good"", ""its weird and hard to understand"" well yeah you're only mentally present in a quarter of the movie. That road scene couldve hit a lot harder if i watched it alone tbh",normal

"Was Edward Scissorhands set in Wisconsin or Minnesota?   As a native of the midwest, I feel like I can place this movie in the suburbs of either of these two states.  I know Tim Burton took inspiration from Burbank, CA, but the neighborhood aesthetic, the accents and the fucking asymmetrical /bouffant/bobbed hairdos all tells me northern midwest.  Mr. Boggs is a bowling champion, and loves fishing.  Diane Wiest has an ambiguous accent, but her tone is 100% upper midwest.  Winona Ryder‚Äôs accent also nails it.  Up north, the accents really develop strongly well into adulthood.  ",normal

"Examples of revisionist history about Movies? I know that I really hate revisionist history because it inaccurate whoops, some of the things that actually happened. With movies, I can honestly understand that some movies that were either loved or hated at the time, are being not being revisioned by people who have not researched on how those movies were made and how they were perceived at the time. 

I can give you an example of a movie that was revisioned in history for the worst: The Star Wars prequel movies are now be celebrated as misunderstood films that were actually masterpieces when in truth they were so hated by the fans at the time that it was the most hated thing in pop culture history. The prequel movies were also so bad that people hated George Lucas for it. 

Another example is the 1993 Super Mario bros movie. People are seeming warming up to the belief that the movie was a ok movie based on the most popular video game franchises in history when in truth that movie had bad production, horrible plot, and completely misses the point of the Mario bros franchise completely and people literally hated it at the time. 

Can you give and example of a movie that was revisioned into history and explained what really happened when the movie was released and made? ",normal
"Rating a movie.  Hi folks! üé¨

I've been having this debate with a friend for a few days now and I would like your opinion: I got a real problem with the movies rating system these days. I've tried on my Letterboxd account but I can't do it anymore. Like, I find it genuinely stupid to attribute stars, or a note /10, /20 whatever, to a movie? Imo, art is not meant to be graded, it is meant to be appreciated and evaluated by technical criterias. You can explain why you appreciate, or not, a movie, why it fails, or not, in its mission, but I feel like the ratings are too objective for something as subjective as evaluating a film (especially nowadays, where ratings can create, or serve, free hate movements against a film on the internet). It would be like giving a score to a painting, or to music, something we rarely do btw, it doesn't make sense in my mind? 

I am of course open to respectful discussion, and why not be convinced, what do you think? üôÇ",normal
"Is Terrifier 3 better then 1 & 2? So I know Art from some memes on Instagram and because Terrifier 3 is running in theatres right now i gave the movies a chance and watched them, because my wife & me wanna go watch a movie in theatres this weekend.

We both really like Art, what kind of a killer he is, how he is acting and what he is doing. He is super creepy and funny at the same time, but unfortunately the movies itself are pretty boring/trashy, so we didnt enjoyed them pretty much. (Pls dont hate us, lol)

So is Terrifier 3 somewhat differen, or just more of the same? We are bored that there is no real exciting plot to follow, just people who get killed (Even Part 2 tryied to tell more story then part 1). Also it seems like there are no real rules about Art & his Skills in Surviveabillity. When we watching The First movie i was like ""Pls, dont make him supernatural"" and in the end... you know, he comes back. In Movie #2 he get even more ""killed"" and still be alive, kinda lame.

If the killer would have been not as funny as Art we prob would have stopped watching. The gore isnt a problem, even if its way over the top and just stupid. Its the plot/storytelling, what is pretty boring.",normal

Just looking at his filmography, Eric really had potential in the early 80s, with films like King of The Gypsies, Raggedy Man, Star 80, The Pope Of Greenwich Village, The Cocoa Cola Kid, & Runaway Train, giving good performances in these films, and earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for Runaway Train. He was really on the rise.

However after Runaway Train, I feels like he just gave up, and just decided to acting in anything and I mean just about anything for a paycheck.

"Arsenic and Old Lace Halloween appreciation post It's Halloween. Most people are watching ghost movies or slasher flicks or creature features but in my house, we sit with a glass of elderberry wine and watch the 1944 classic *Arsenic and Old Lace*.

For those who don't know it, Cary Grant plays recently-married critic Mortimer Brewster who returns home to his elderly aunts on Halloween only to discover that they've been poisoning lonely old men in the neighbourhood. Complications arise from his brothers (one who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt and the other who looks like Boris Karloff).

Taking place in (more or less) a single set, it's a wonderful screwball comedy. Completely over the top acting, especially from Grant. I know that he wasn't fond of his performance, but I think he's got the perfect mix of serious and madcap. The deadpan delivery from much of the supporting cast sells the comedy.

The MO of the aunts is incredible: they are perfectly believable as serial killers who murder out of misplaced mercy. In a time before formal criminal profiling, their behaviours seem exceedingly accurate. 

The plot doesn't meander much, although there are a few extraneous characters, such as the Reverend living next door (Mortimer's new father-in-law), who only appears in a single scene. He could have been cut or else developed further. 

Overall, a wonderfully silly alternative Halloween movie.",normal

However they more than often don't end up being that memorable. I read the plot and it sounds really intriguing and original but the final product often is undercooked or just should have been better. Plus I hate it that they all have that sterile Netflix sheen in the film grain (or lack of). Last night I watched I Came By that was okay but could and should have been so much better and I know I'll never watch it again. A better one was Leave no Trace.

Here's 3 I wish got talked about more

Edison (2005)

Game 6 (2006)

Blindspotting (2018)

I know Blindspotting got a TV show, but I don't see anybody talking about either one. Edison was Justin Timberlake's film debut and he's acting alongside Kevin Spacey, Dylan McDermott (who is absolutely FANTASTIC in it) and Morgan Freeman and I think he holds his own. Game 6 was released 2 years before RDJ became Iron Man, so he hadn't quite become a household name and it also stars Michael Keaton, who had made a name for himself as Beetlejuice and Batman. It's set in 1986 New York, game 6 of the World Series that year. They are 3 I will always try to recommend to people. ",normal

"I'm a 45yo who hasn't watched rated R horror movies until this month. I watched one a day and ranked them. I'm 45 and have watched almost no rated R horror movies before (with a few exceptions, like Silence of the Lambs and Alien/Aliens).  For most of my life I've been too afraid to watch horror movies generally, and the idea of R rated level violence and scares have kept me away.  This month I decided to change that, and for a Halloween challenge I've watched one horror movie for each day in October (I wasn't exact, some days I missed and others I watched a couple, but for the most part I kept my schedule).  I tried to pick culturally significant horror movies. After watching each one, I reviewed and ranked them.  I decided to give a one to ten number rating each movie's scare value (S), how disturbing (disgusting or revolting imagery, actions or themes) the movie is (D), and how fun the movie is to watch (F).  Lastly, I ranked them in order of my least to most favorite movie overall.  I considered overall quality and not necessarily the S, D and F ratings to make my final rankings at the bottom of the post.



I'm interested in feedback and would love to see others rank these movies as well!  Minor spoilers in the reviews.



Oct 1st: Halloween 2018. Solid soundtrack, Jamie Lee Curtis forever! I enjoyed the revenge plot and the cat and mouse play.  Entertaining, but a bit ridiculous.  I had a great time, but this isn't high minded stuff.  I realize now that I probably should have watched the original first.  S 3, D 4, F 8.



Oct 2nd: The Blair Witch Project.  I feel like this was only a hit because it pulled off the hand held faux docu-movie in a way that fooled the public because it was relatively unique at the time. I was bored, and not scared. Maybe it would have been different if I'd watched it in 1999 and thought it was an actual documentary.  S 2, D 1, F 1.



Oct 3rd: The Witch.  Eggers clearly has a style (I've seen The Northman).  This was creepy and engaging, and had some real gross and memorable scenes, especially involving children and an infant.  I feel like the ending didn't pack as much of a wallop as the build-up seemed to promise, although it still hit well enough with a memorable closing shot.  Eggers clearly was going for arthouse horror and succeeded.  Also, thank you for bringing us Anya Taylor-Joy.  S 6, D 8, F 4.



Oct 4th: Nightmare on Elm Street. Eighties camp, here we are. Disco electronica soundtrack, Johnny Depp's massive blood volume, and a memorable but not that scary villain.  Didn't age incredibly well, but fun for what it is. S 3, D 4, F 6.



Oct 5th: Friday the 13th. This one was kinda dumb.  Maybe the sequels are better, since I suppose they have more Jason.  But I did get to see Kevin Bacon get an arrow slow-pushed through his cricoid, so there's that. S 2, D 3, F 2.



Oct 6th: Hereditary. Jeesh.  This is peak disturbing, especially *that* scene, taken together with the characters' upsetting responses.  Ari Aster clearly knows how to upset his audience.  I wish there was more exposition around the mythology and story in a way that made the movie's plot and ending more immediately accessible.  Still, Toni Collette was incredible and this movie seems deserving of its modern horror classic designation. S 9, D 10, F 2.



Oct 7th: Midsommar.  Two Ari Asters in a row.  This time he nails disturbing with crazy memorable images in the opening, middle, and closing sections. I didn't know a movie could be so upsetting without resorting to dark rooms and hallways. Also, Florence Pugh's closing expression, yikes.  S 6, D 10, F 5.



Oct 8th: Psycho. This is a pretty excellent movie.  I've never seen Hitchcock before this month.  I recognize why he's one of the greats after watching this.  The plot twist is great.  The lead up and execution of the famous shower scene is great.  The script and acting are great.  Bravo.  S 6, D 5, F 4.



Oct 9th: The Birds.  This Hitchcock didn't do it for me.  Birds ultimately just aren't that scary.  I couldn't buy into the plot device or the romance at the center.  But filming all the birds must have been pretty tricky! S 3, D 3, F 2.



Oct 10th: The Shining.  Peak horror.  Nicholson at his best.  The story, the style, the imagery, the scares are all spot on and memorable in the best ways.  It feels like a work of art.  I wish Kubrick had done more straight horror.  That said, he could have helped Shelley Duvall with her ""scared running"" technique a little.  S 8, D 6, F 8.



Oct 11th: The Exorcist. I've grown up hearing that this is the scariest movie ever.  After watching, I get it.  That possessed girl is not cool.  Ellen Burstyn is fantastic.  Some of those scenes are absolutely unforgettable.  How was this made in 1973?  Deserved its best picture nom.  Horrifying.  Do not recommend.  S 10, D 9, F 3.



Oct 12th: Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is just fine movie making.  I can see how this influenced so many horror movies to come.  Incredible dinner table scene, and the closing shot is clearly iconic.  This movie has aged almost perfectly, with the chase scene being the only exception (could have done with a few less clips of him running after her through the trees).  S 5, D 8, F 3.



Oct 13th: Rosemary's Baby. So, she was raped by Satan?  Ok then.  Honestly, this is obviously elite direction, writing, character development and acting.  The movie was clearly way ahead of its time for horror. The ending is disturbing and effective. I imagine this movie is even more upsetting to those who've experienced pregnancy, especially as Rosemary is being manipulated by her husband and doctors.  I know I can never show this one to my wife. I'm no movie historian, but I understand why this is on a lot of all-time best movie lists.  S 3, D 8, F 6.



Oct 14th: The Mist. Pretty standard, kinda fun and scary creature flick until that ending. I'm sure the ending has been talked about ad nauseum because it is so impactful and shocking. Let me just say this: it made me feel physically ill.  It's burned in my head forever now. I'm not sure I'm happy about it. And isn't that what a good horror is supposed to do?  S 5, D 10, F 5.



Oct 15th: It (2017).  I haven't seen the original, but I thought this movie was really solid.  Steven King knows how to weave a yarn.  Seems to me this movie is the reason that Stranger Things exists, and it did the ""80s kids on bikes who outshine and outsmart the adults"" thing as well as it can be done.  Real solid scares too, that clown is creep town.  Some of the scare set pieces felt a little forced, though.  S 8, D 6, F 8.



Oct 16th: Get Out.  I think the social commentary delivery by this movie is pitch perfect. The plot is well done with an engaging cast, and there are some nice shocking reveals. The movie built suspense well, is perfectly directed, and kept me engaged throughout. This is a solid horror. However, I may have expected more than I got given all the awards and recognition hype. S 6, D 6, F 6.



Oct 17th:  Paranormal Activity. Really freaked me out for some reason. The nanny cam view capturing spooky stuff at night messing with oblivious people sleeping in their bed captures one of my unreasonable fears by violating my primary safe space, my room. I don't like it.  Other than the scare device, though, there's not much to this movie.  S 9, D 2, F1.



Oct 18th: Nope. Unpopular opinion alert: This is my pick between the two Jordan Peele movies I watched.  I love this movie so much. It is riotously funny in parts and pretty atmospheric and frightening in others. I can't take my eyes off of Daniel Kaluuya, he's so intense. I love the juxtaposing stories all driving home the message that non-human intelligent beings (whether chimps, horses, or aliens) don't exist just to be gawked at by a paying human public. They just might get their revenge.  What a ride.   S 7, D 5, F 9.



Oct 19th:  It Follows.  The best premise to a horror flick I've ever seen or heard of. Of course there should be a movie about a horror STD.  And it happens to be expertly executed.  The movie managed to get under my skin by exploiting my fear of being followed.  It crafts a sense of dread because the bad guy can always be anyone and it never stops walking toward you unless you have sex to pass the scourge onto someone you might really care about.  Talk about moral dilemmas.  If any horror movie deserves a sequel, it's this one. C'mon David Robert Mitchell, give us ""It Still Follows,"" we would all watch it.  S 8, D 7, F 6.



Oct 20th: Talk To Me.  From the jump, this flick knows how to shock and build suspense.  It has a couple of pretty memorable frightening moments and manages to stay creepy, with a solid ending.  I'm learning that people getting possessed is a really scary thing for me to watch, and this movie has that in spades.  This is a lesser known horror gem IMO.  S 9, D 8, F 3.



Oct 21st:  Scream.  The opening was destined to become a classic moment in horror. This is meant to be a fun self-aware movie, with clever horror genre references throughout and a twist for the reveal.  And lots and lots of stabbing.  I definitely had a good time.  Not very scary though.  S 3, D 3, F 8.



Oct 22nd:  The Thing.  Yes!  Inject this into my veins.  Would make a perfect double feature with Alien.  Everything was just right: Kurt Russell's paranoia, John Carpenter's direction, Rob Bottin's creature work, the suspicion created by the genius plot device, the chill-to-the-bone setting, and the perfectly ambiguous ending.  I love this movie.  S 6, D 8, F 10.



Oct 23rd:  Saw.  This is where the Escape Rooms trend came from?  My kids thank you, Saw.  This was a fun ride with a clever ending. Also, why don't people with one leg ever stand and hop in the movies? Dragging themselves around smh.  S 6, D 7, F 8.



Oct 24th:  Barbarian.  What the?  I honestly didn't find it terribly scary, but it's high on the disturbing scale.  Props working in a ""me too"" theme.  The kill at the end was definitely a gruesome shocker.  But c'mon, that last set piece defies physics in too many ways to give it a pass.  S 4, D 8, F 2.



Oct 25th:  Pearl.  Mia Goth's acting deserves a shout out for that closing credits clip alone. Not sure about the southern girl accent despite her being raised in relative isolation by her German speaking mother.  It feels a bit over the line manipulative, although I suppose that is partly the point, to feel ridiculously, sarcastically manipulated - but not fooled - by Pearl. Such an interesting movie. Lots of buildup to a pretty upsetting conclusion. I admire the risks it takes and the artistry it shows. Felt like pre-tornado Wizard of Oz with a Return to Oz below-the-surface creepiness.  S 4, D 8, F 5.



Oct 26th:  Sinister.  I read a study that tried to scientifically prove which horror movie is the scariest based on the heart rate increase of the audience. Sinister was officially named by the study authors as the Most Scary Movie. So I watched it. And, yes, it's pretty high up on the list for me. The soundtrack is pulsating, the family snuff videos awful, and the darkness prevalent. The movie is almost all in the dark. Ethan Hawke is always excellent. The end reveal is mostly predictable, but this movie definitely delivers the scares. Edit: This movie ended up freaking me out so bad I had trouble sleeping and had to watch some SNL at 1am to settle down.  S 10, D 7, F 2.



Oct 27th:  Hellraiser (1987).  It tried to be an interesting ""how far would you go to get what you most want"" movie, which is more theme than most of the other 80's horror I watched this month. Most of the runtime I was thinking ""dang, the makeup and creature effects are really good for '87"" and then the special effects at the end made me want to take it all back. Overall pretty disturbing and gruesome, and fairly well done without being very scary.  But the ending was a dud in almost every way.  S 3, D 8, F 3.



Oct 28th: Candyman (1992).  I went in with low expectations after being burned by Hellraiser, and the movie beat them comfortably. I thought it was really solid. I loved the soundtrack, the villain was memorable, and the plot was tightly wound and appropriately suspenseful.  It even mostly stuck the landing.  S 6, D 6, F 7.



Oct 29th:  The Descent.  I saw this one mentioned a lot so I gave it a go and I'm glad I did.  It's like A Quiet Place but dialed up to 11 with its pitch black cave setting, claustrophobia, and bloody violent (and quite upsetting) kills.  The action in this movie is breathtaking in spots.  A plot choice made at the end really upset me, which makes the film all the more memorable.  S 9, D 7, F 6.



Oct 30th: The Wicker Man (1973).  Not sure what I was expecting with this one, but it wasn't the cross between a hyper-sexualized The Sound of Music and Midsommar that I got. Overall a bit slow and unscary but turns the corner in the last 20 minutes with an incredibly impactful ending that really delves into questions of the ethics of religious piety and perspective. And it was super cool to watch a Christopher Lee masterclass from his younger days.  S 1, D6, F2. 



Oct 31st (watched it yesterday):  The Evil Dead (1981). Oh wow. Ok. Well, Sam Raimi certainly did some stuff here!  Nice use of fog and camera perspective work, and the creature makeup is crazy. This movie has some hilariously messed up images and kills. I didn't know whether to laugh or freak out or throw up through most of it.  And the gore.  Oh, the gore.  It was often hard to distinguish whether it's high camp or high art, and maybe it's both.  This movie obviously birthed a lot of horror tropes.  I can't believe what I just watched.  And I can't believe I almost didn't watch it, being the last film on the list.  S 7, D 10, F 7.

"Movies Thriller Recommendations? (Home Invasions) I saw a movie called *Hush (2016)* a while back and I'm no horror watcher at all, but that was a great watch for me. The thing about horror movies like *Hereditary* or *Midsommar* is that the plot is ""ambiguous"" (to me at least) and they rely on effects and creepy stuff to drive the movie. That stuff doesn't do it to me because I watch movies to be immersed in a streamline plot. The problem for me with popular horror movies like *Nightmare on Elm Street* or *Friday the 13th* is that the antagonists are literally unbeatable so you're basically just watching a slaughter fest and when the protagonist actually ""survives"", the antagonist was never really defeated. When it came to *Hush*, the ""home invasion"" idea really does it for me. The plot is straight forward enough to make you wonder what's going to happen next, they keep you at the edge of your seat without having to use crazy gore or fantasy elements, and the antagonist is just a human being that can **die**. Just the idea of someone breaking into your house and something plot driven makes it even scarier to me because it's almost like ""damn this can happen to me.""

I wanted to watch something along those lines, but didn't even know what to look up so I just stopped watching the horror genre again. Now that it's Halloween, I recently watched *Speak No Evil (2024 remake)* with a couple of friends and it was exactly along the lines of what I was looking for back when I watched *Hush*. Plot made sense, good resolution to the movie, and I was anxious the whole time (and bonus, it didn't rely on a jump scare every few minutes).

Now I really want to watch more movies just like that and I figured this sub was the best place to ask. Any movie recommendations for a horror/thriller like this where the plot is straight forward, the ending doesn't leave you with ""what if?"", and isn't driven by fantasy elements like demons or immortal unbeatable antagonists?

\*\*Just wanted to make a note that these opinions are my own. Some people might find the plot to, let's say, *Midsommar* to be straight forward, but to me it wasn't. I'm a simple man and don't want to be confused by eerie elements thrown at me.",normal

"Favorite movie by european country: Bosnia and Herzegovina Hello there,

yesterday was an interesting day on my little journey here. I've asked you for the most popular movie set in Belgium, and in a way, *C'est arriv√© pr√®s de chez vous* (or as it was titled in English-language distribution: *Man bites dog*), could have been the clear winner here,  If I would have add up all the upvotes (minus the downvotes) for comments that put it in the mix... but that's not how this game is played. Instead, I looked up which movie was mentioned in the top comment. And, of course, it was ***In Bruges*** \- I should have bet money.

Today I hope that there will be less confusion about who has already named which title and when. But it's definitely going to be exciting, because unlike yesterday, I don't have a film on my screen today that I think could win the race here. Today it's about your most favorite movie set in **Bosnia and Herzegovina** and the rules are the same as everyday:

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to name only one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

"An argument for Motel Hell This movie was released in 1980 and I‚Äôve always been a sucker for  horror films from that era. I‚Äôm only bringing this up because I think it‚Äôs been kind of forgotten with the multitude of classic horror/slasher films of that period that spawned franchises like Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and others and in my opinion is far more entertaining than any of the sequels in those franchises. Motel Hell is a one off with a great central premise and main villains who are at once horrifyingly efficient yet kinda likeable and funny.

Charlie Brewster and Peter Vincent are one excellent and entertaining and well cast and performed vampire hunting team!

"""Paleness"" in old movies Well, for a long time, since I was a child, I watched a lot of films from the 80s and 90s, but what catches my attention the most and what I wanted to ask about is the ‚Äúpaleness‚Äù behind the atmosphere of some films made in those decades. I'll give you an example: ‚ÄúEdward Scissorhands‚Äù, the sky in this film is very white in some scenes, not to mention the color palette. Another good example we have of this type of film are the scenes that take place in cemeteries. Imagine a wake, the camera is focused above, showing the characters' faces and the sky in the background, so it will certainly be very white and rainy, why is that?",normal

Rant incoming.

  
The pacing is all over the place. I felt like I watched 3 different movies. It never really builds up to anything, it's just constant build with no payoff...

  
The plot makes no sense and has way too much going on. They start this entire thread about Terry's cousin being mixed up with some gang he ratted out, which ends when he dies, okay, sure. Then there's some shady stuff going on with the Chinese restaurant with is clearly a front for something, which is never explained, just another thread left nowhere. Why do they give Terry money so easily? The police raid the Chinese food place over the phone, that does nowhere and is never mentioned again. Then there's the corruption of the cops stealing money due to some very specific lawsuit that happened and they keep prisoners for 90 days until the dash-cam footage deletes. At first they indicate the judge is pushing back against it, then he's in on it, then tries to commit suicide... okay. The entire ""scheme"" is super convoluted.

Terry takes the deal from the Chief to leave town half way through the film, then decides more or less off-screen to change his mind and go full John Wick even though 5 minutes before he said he didn't give a shit about the corruption. There was no character moment for him to make that ""choice"". The cops drug Summer to keep her quiet, but not kill her, even though it would have made way more sense that they do and frame it as a junkie OD. 

It's just all so much and so convoluted.

There was no character development for any character in the film at all. Every single character is 1-dimensional and starts exactly the same as they finish. You never learn any real backstory about Terry, other than he knows martial arts and was in the Marines, which also bothered me because they built it up like he was gonna be some Seal Team 6 bad ass, and he just knows martial arts, but a lot of Marines and military know martial arts, why he is ""special"".  They built him up to be some baba-yaga when he's really just an ordinary badass.

  
Then that ending, holy hell what was that!? Okay, the final shootout/action scene was bad-ass, and the main actor, is great in the role, but the ""ending"" sequence makes NO sense. 

First there's the ""reveal"" of Summers informant, Rory from the Office, which makes no sense. First of all, she had no idea a day before about any of the corruption dealings, it was not until she started looking into Terry's cousins case that she discovered the issue. Then all of a sudden, this STUDENT, ALMOST LAWYER, has an INFORMANT in the police force who is giving her inside information, and it turns out to be Rory, the guy who at the beginning of the film, was a corrupt douche who robs Terry and is CLEARLY in on the entire situation. This guy turns informant for a student, to rat out the operation he was involved in... why???

Then the final ""chase"" scene, the chief calls in state police backup, says they need to get their story in first, all the cops take off after Terry & crew, with state police incoming, who as far as they know, are now chasing an armed assailant who attached multiple police officers and stole a police vehicle with 1 officer prisoner....

Then the female officer has a change of heart, with no setup really, rams the Chief off the road and .... and that's it.

All the other corrupt cops, the state police just say ""Oh... well nevermind!"" and proceed to escort Terry & crew to the hospital and the movie ends.  There's no scene or indication any of the other cops are wavering or having a change of heart, no reason the state police would back off.

You also get no payoff with the Chief, the main Antagonist the entire film, he just sits in his car after getting rammed off the road. There's no final confrontation, no payoff.

I feel like I watched a completely different film than everyone else, I honestly thought it was pretty underwhelming. 2 1/2 hours of buildup and no payoff, felt insulting.

" What the sequel to Beetlejuice could've been What the f\*%$ happened to this sequel? It was all over the place. It's like they tried to do too many things in one movie. Like he tried to combine Schitt's Creek, Beetlejuice, and Wednesday into one shitty confusing plot. It's a simple movie, and you messed it up. You had everything you needed, all the good actors, the set, and you f&%$ed it up. Why did this almost turn into a teen love story? Who was the guy proposing to Lydia? How did he not know anything about her past. Too many side stories that nobody was buying. You covered the iconic house. Why did it take so long to summon Beetlejuice?

First, I would've started with Lydia being a successful author who had to make public appearances, but didn't like doing that fake shit. Her fame was fading and she was hitting serious writer block. She is dark and strange, but doesn't care. She's not a fake ass talk show host. She's confident, but bored with her life. Her husband travels for work, but oh shit, he dies in a car accident. He comes back to the house not knowing he's dead, and she doesn't realize because she can see the dead. The rest of the world doesn't see him, but he can't leave the house. Sand worms. Sound familiar. Yeah, that's because I'm using the same theme as the prior movie. Which makes sense as a sequel.

Now, her husband is having trouble. He can't move on. And they can't get it on. It's kind lame being dead. He doesn't want to live life as a ghost. So, she summons Beetlejuice in desperation. He shows up guns blazing. He's the same dirty old bastard and strikes up an interest with her daughter. Completely believable. She uses her power to put him back in his place, but he's not completely gone. The family tries to move past this shit and help their father. As they're trying to do different things to help their father live in his new reality, Beetlejuice is summoned again by a neighbor who also has an interest in the daughter. He falls into a trap that Beetlejuice lays out for him. Next thing you know, the daughter is supposed to wed Beetlejuice. Da ja vu. What happens next?

The OG film was art. It reflected reality in a fantastical way. The sequel is bulljuice.",normal
"The Devotion of Suspect X ‚Äì 2008 Japanese Movie *Note: I‚Äôve divided this post into two sections - the first part that is SPOILER-FREE and the second with SPOILERS. If you haven‚Äôt seen ""The Devotion of Suspect X"" and want to watch it, I suggest skipping the SPOILERS section.*

About a decade ago, I first watched *The Devotion of Suspect X*. I hadn‚Äôt heard much about it, just that it was an intriguing Japanese thriller worth checking out. Watching it for the first time, I was captivated; it was one of the most impressive international films I‚Äôd ever seen. Even now, it remains a favorite. The movie has inspired remakes across several countries like Korea, China, and India, and I‚Äôve tried to catch each one. While these versions each bring something new, the original Japanese adaptation remains my top pick. It‚Äôs surprising there hasn‚Äôt been a Hollywood remake yet - rumors pop up now and then, but nothing has materialized. 

The movie tells the story of a brilliant math teacher who becomes embroiled in a crime, devising a meticulous plan to outsmart the police and protect someone dear to him. But his strategy is put to the test when his equally brilliant former college friend joins the investigation. What unfolds is a tense and layered game of wits, combining mystery and thriller elements with emotional depth. Rather than sticking to a standard police procedural, the movie impressively delves deeply into the psychological motives of each of the key characters.

The film is based on the celebrated Japanese mystery novel by Keigo Higashino, and for movie fans, this is an absolute must-watch. I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough.

**SPOILERS BELOW!**

Where do I even begin? What I love most about this film is how it pits two brilliant characters against each other in a battle of wits. Both are highly intelligent, methodical, and driven by complex, often conflicting motives, making for a suspenseful, balanced showdown.

Another standout aspect is the intricate, multi-layered cover-up of a killing devised by the math teacher. Driven by his quiet adoration, he goes to extraordinary lengths to protect the woman he loves. Every move he makes is calculated, drawing viewers down a twisting path filled with subtle, fascinating clues. His friend is equally sharp, intuitively deciphering what the math teacher may be hiding. Watching these two intellectual giants navigate the high-stakes scenario is exhilarating.

The performances bring solid depth to the story. The math teacher‚Äôs portrayal captures a powerful vulnerability, making his brilliance and desperation feel deeply human and relatable. You feel for him even though he has killed an innocent person to protect the woman he loves. The woman he protects plays her role with quiet strength and guilt, while the college friend brings a cool, precise determination to uncover the truth, haunted by the realization that his old friend - perhaps even cleverer than he - is his opponent.

Ultimately, for me, this movie is more than a well-crafted mystery. It‚Äôs a heartfelt narrative of sacrifice, loneliness, and unrequited love. You can‚Äôt help but feel for the math teacher, who‚Äôs willing to sacrifice everything - even to the point of implicating himself and taking an innocent life - to shield her. This wasn‚Äôt a movie where I was just waiting for the final reveal. I was so invested in the characters that I genuinely hoped the ending would do justice to them all.",normal
"who is responsible for holdin back movie theater technology from the public?? like most of u here i have been goin to movies my entire life n the theaters have mostly been the same

other than installin those chairs that assault the person sittin in them there isnt much different in movies since i saw batman forever in 2007

but the big moment for me was this weekend when i finally took the plunge n upgraded my tv to a big screen 4k rca (splurged because i wanted a reliable brand and they have been around since the early 1900s). 

i put on china town (famouse jack nickelson film) and everything was so clear. usually when u see movies the screens at the theaters are kind of cheaper and dont look like real life. same thing on my previous tv. u can tell its a movie. 

when i watched china town everybody was moving so clearly. it was like real life right in front of me. maybe even clearer than real life. i thought jack nicholson was gonna walk into my living room.

is there a reason why movie theaters are still stuck in the stone age? is it because of 2 many ppl downloading movies? you wouldnt steal a car. etc? things r so much clearer on home tvs. its too bad they cant just have a giant 500 inch rca tv lol but the biggest one they make is 80 inches which would be 2 small i assume

i know that the movie industry is rife with bad actors (that is a pun) but you would think someone like james cameroon would have pushed for these new technologies. 

this is more of a thot piece but if u know anythin about this topic like have some juicy conspiracies about hollywood not lettin movie theaters get the newest tech u can post it.",normal

"I liked Strange Darling, but it‚Äôs not as clever as it thinks it is *Strange Darling* has gotten a lot of praise in this sub, and I see what people like about it, but it also rubbed me the wrong way.

I‚Äôm sure you could write a dissertation about the problematic gender politics at play, but my issues are more with the story itself and the way that it‚Äôs presented.

I think that announcing your film was shot on 35mm in big text right at the start is eye roll-inducing on its own, but this weird moment is also kind of indicative of the movie‚Äôs whole vibe, which is like it‚Äôs constantly asking, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt I so cool and interesting?‚Äù

There‚Äôs a very self-conscious quality to the non-linear structure. The movie is presented in chapters and we‚Äôre given the numbers out of sequence, so it‚Äôs clear right away that the film *really* wants us to know that it‚Äôs doing something weird. Most viewers will recognize right away that the movie is hinting at some big twist that will turn our perception of what we‚Äôve seen on its head. The problem is, that twist is painfully obvious.

The reveal that the Lady is actually the serial killer that the opening text crawl tells us about feels so predictable that I was certain there must be another twist coming. Okay, so she‚Äôs the killer, sure, but who is the guy? Is he really a cop? Is he undercover? Is he also a serial killer and these two just picked each other as targets?

Nope, none of that. Once we learn the twist, that‚Äôs kind of it. The rest of the movie is mostly just her pulling the same trick over and over (‚ÄúI‚Äôm injured, help me‚Äù) and it basically working every time. The film‚Äôs final act is shockingly conventional.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie because it has a great soundtrack and Willa Fitzgerald is fantastic, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs nearly as clever as it thinks it is. ",normal

Those two movies were Body Bags, by John Carpenter, and The Monster Squad, AKA The Goonies vs. The Universal Monsters.

The first film, Body Bags, was pretty good and fun. It was sort of an anthology film created by John Carpenter, that was originally supposed to be a show on Showtime, but then Showtime dropped it and it got reworked with whatever they had done into a movie. 

The three stories were one about a slasher at a gas station at night, hunting the new employee there, a story about a man trying to get hair only for it to backfire and him getting infected by an alien Parasite, and the final one has a baseball player (played by Marl Hamill) lose his eye in a car accident, and ends up getting the eye of a serial killer, and ends up going crazy. The film was honestly fine for what it was.

But The Monster Squad.....the Monster Squad was so good. This is probably the best use of the Universal Monsters I have seen and probably the closest we will see to seeing them all on screen at once, and the best part is, it did not take itself too seriously at all in the slightest. The costume work for the Monsters was phenomenal, and the acting from the kids was genuinely not bad at all either. 

The story was appropriately ridiculous and insane in the best way possible, with a lot of corny and cheesy moments to come. Don't even get me started on the Pepsi product placement. The film however did have some unironically good stuff as well, such as humor that unironically landed, genuinely good heartfelt moments, great costume work (like I said), and a solidly paced runtime of an hour and 22 minutes.

The is truly the Avengers of the Universal Monsters, and I absolutely love it. If they ever remake this, instead of being dark, realistic, and gritty, I hope its just as fun and over the top as the original is.",normal
"[DISCUSSION] I literally do not see Ben Affleck as anybody other than himself. I never see him as whatever character he plays; I only see him as Ben Affleck. I feel this way about most actors honestly and that‚Äôs why I find movies so boring these days. Ben Affleck is just the best example, he is just so horrendous at every attempt at acting. I literally cannot see him as any other character except himself, no matter what he is in. To me all I see him as is Ben Affleck.

"Higher resolution formats of movies and shows suck because they neary always change the color grade I was watching The Godfather on blu ray and it was orange as hell.

I luckily was able to adjust the settings on my TV so it wasn't so orange and it looked fantastic, like the dvd.  But yeah my point is they should just release it with the same everything just at a higher resolution for the blu ray and 4k releases. It feels off watching it changed and there have been other movies I just stick to the dvd and I really was hyped for 4k but learned they nearly always change things and blu ray also when they may changes make me nope out",normal

"If you could undo one death in a movie, what would it be? (Spoilers)  I have a few deaths that I wish I could rewrite. For one, Bill in *Kill Bill*. I know he was a murdering you-know-what. Him dying matches the trajectory of the Bride‚Äôs quest for revenge, but dang. It hit me somewhere when he died, which I guess was Tarantino‚Äôs intent. David Carradine was so good you just didn‚Äôt want to see him go. I always wondered if he‚Äôd end up being alive in the long-awaited sequel, but Carradine‚Äôs passing removed that possibility, sadly. (I know that him being alive wasn‚Äôt a really possibility with Pei-Mai‚Äôs Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique, but I was hoping for something.) 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the deaths of Newt and Hicks in *Alien3*. I pretend that movie doesn‚Äôt exist, it was so angering for me. Here these two plucky souls survived a harrowing attack and close calls with drones and face huggers only to get killed in a crash. In Newt‚Äôs case, it was even worse because she watched her entire colony get wiped out, then the crew of Marines sent to save her get demolished (‚ÄúGame over, man!‚Äù), and then she dies while in stasis. This little girl survived so many odds only to end like that, and we got really invested in the bond between Newt and Ripley and Hicks and Ripley only for it to go away. ",normal
"Recasting One Role in an Otherwise Really Good Movie Is there a movie you really like but feel like one role could have been cast better?

When they were getting to make Traffic, Steven Soderbergh supposedly worked with Harrison Ford for some time on getting the role of the drug czar just right for Harrison to accept. Harrison ultimately decided to not do the movie and Michael Douglas was cast in the role. Soderbergh said some of the changes he and Harrison came up with were left in the final script. Michael Douglas was fine in the role, though I have sometimes thought about Harrison Ford co-starring in a Steven Soderbergh film.

It‚Äôs probably my favourite PTA movie of all time and it gave me my favourite ddl performance too even though something like there will be blood is objectively better. 

Considering ddl had announced that phantom thread was his last movie should have probably given him the edge in 2018 to win his 4th Oscar so I was surprised when oldman won it, not that he didn‚Äôt deserve it ",normal

"Horror/B movies where most of the main cast come out alive and/or has a definitive happy ending. Happy early Halloween everyone.

We already know many horror and B movies love to end with either most if not all of the main cast dead, some sort of ominous cliffhanger for suspense or sequelbait, or both. 

What are some films in the genre where either a good amount of the main cast introduced in the movie make it to the end barring maybe 2-3 deaths depending on the cast size, or has a wholesome/satisfying ending where you're confident the main character(s) will be ok, or both? 

Even if the movie has a sequel or sequels as long as the movie on its own feels like it could comfortably end there it counts.

"""Jagged Edge"" (1985): What could have been a campy movie about defense attorney Glenn Close having the hots for accused sexy killer Jeff Bridges turns out to be a good movie. The part where the androgynous Close is on top of Jeff Bridges made it look like a gay sex scene. Which was pretty hot. 

Originally, Close was not wanted for the lead because producer Martin Ransoshoff found her ""too ugly""  but Richard Marquand stood by her and she got the part and the movie ended up being a hit. 

It kept you guessing, it was a engrossing courtroom thriller that held your attention from beginning to end. Oh, sure, we still get some campy moments like Close being called a bitch by a witness or Close freaking out in the closet over a contrived, silly twist. 

And Robert Loggia is a total odd duck, acting like a supporting character from a Columbo episode.

"""Costumes"" vs. ""Clothing"" This is a philosophical quandary that's been in my head for a while. When it comes to designing for film, stage, and television, how much of a line is there between ""costumes"" (as in something that is intentionally made for a performance and not much else) - and ""clothing"" (something this is also made for a performance but could be worn as an actual garment away from the spotlight)? 

Putting aside the question of whether or not it's strange to wear period dress or fantastical items as everyday garments, I think at least part of it boils down to the level of crafting that goes into them. Something made of relatively cheap material without much detailing - and possibly mass produced - falls more onto the ""costume"" side of the scale. By contrast, when extreme attention is given to the look, feel, and fit of a garment (not necessarily going full haute couture but with a similar mindset), that seem to me more like a ""clothing"" item.

Please share your thoughts on where you think this divide falls (or whether you think it's even real) as well as your listings of films, stage productions, and television shows that lean towards one side or the other.",normal

* A Nightmare On Elm Street - New Nightmare
* Saw - Original
* Scream - Original

* Insidious - Insidious: Chapter 3
* Paranormal Activity - Original
* Conjuring Universe - The Conjuring 2
* Terrifier - Terrifier 2
* A Quiet Place - Maybe the original? I enjoyed all three and have a hard time picking a favorite.


Also some additional ones:


* Jaws - Original
* Jurassic Park - Original
* MonsterVerse - Maybe Godzilla Vs. Kong? I have a very hard time picking a favorite from this series as I love them all.

I'm sure I left some off. I just listed the major series I remember for the time being. I'm sure a few of my choices are controversial or unconventional. Not to say I dislike the likes of the original Poltergeist or TCM or ROTLD, I just simply enjoyed the sequels or remakes more (and bear in mind, I pretty much consider the likes of Predator 2, ROTLD2 and Poltergeist II equal with the originals as is). I find the original TCM and remake are actually pretty close for me as well. Some might argue Jurassic Park isn't really Horror but I've always kind of considered the series a bit of a Natural Horror/Sci-Fi hybrid, figured why not have it in with my additional choices.

With The Conjuring Universe, the Annabelle films along with The Nun and Curse Of La Llarona count as well. With Terrifier film, there's not just the Terrifier trilogy but also All Hallows'

"Favorite movie by european country: Belgium Hello there,

yesterday I asked you to tell me your favourite movies set in Belarus. The clear winner was ***–ò–¥–∏ –∏ —Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–∏*** or in english: *Come and See* \- an anti-war film that I've never seen before and which doesn't necessarily sound like light entertainment. But now it's on my watch list and I would like to thank everyone who took part in this little ‚Äògame‚Äô yesterday.

Today I continue directly with the next European country in my alphabetical list: **Belgium**. Somehow I have the feeling that I could predict the winner today, but hey - there have already been one or two surprises here (such as ‚ÄòThe Sound of Music‚Äô not winning for Austria) and that's exactly what I love - so please feel free to suggest films that not everyone has on their radar. 

The only thing I would ask you to do is to keep it to the following two rules:

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to only name one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

"My favourite films are set in a single ""dense"" location. What else should I watch? I love films that play out entirely or almost entirely in a single location (not necessarily a single set) that is well-realised in terms of concept, props, and so on.

Some examples:

* The Hateful Eight
* Die Hard
* Alien
* Panic Room

I think the reason I love films with this characteristic is that they prioritise storytelling and creating a believable place, and exude a sense of confidence in the quality of the acting and story rather than relying on constant new distractions.

"Greatest crime in horror movie cinema: the US version of The Descent  I have to get this off my chest. As a semi-casual horror movie fan, The Descent (2005) is one of my favorite horror movies, if not my favorite. It's definitely one of the greatest horror movies ever made. The US version edits the ending, giving it a vanilla ending that I've read is more ""fitting"" for American audiences who can't handle true horror. It's the greatest crime in horror movie cinema. The unedited/UK/original ending is perfect; a horror movie ending for a great horror film.

There are some pretty cool superhero entrances in movies so I will leave that up to other posters but the one I like to mention as memorable comes from the kind of movie I don't usually watch. But glad I did. In The Devil Wears Prada, the director makes sure to build up a lot of anticipation before Miranda Priestly's entrance. 

Here is it, Miranda Priestly (played by Meryl Streep) arriving at her office.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PjZAeiU7uM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PjZAeiU7uM)

I think it's such a suitable entrance because it's only in how people at work react to her that we can see her influence. I mean it's not like she walks in riding a dragon. She looks fashionable and that's about it. But by how her employees respond to her, we as viewers (along with Anne Hathaway's character), get a glimpse of her dictatorial power.

Which entrances have been etched in your memory?",normal

"Groundhog Day could have easily been a psychological horror movie. The idea of reliving the same day with no way out is a psychologically damaging experience in itself that I cannot even imagine how Phil was able to keep sane through it all, unless deep down he was actually a good man, I think that's the only way this movie didn't turn out to be a horror movie. Imagine someone like Anton Chigurh, or Patrick Bateman or even the joker (lord almighty the horror) or even Jack Torrance or that guy from A clockwork orange I don't even think these guys would ever want to leave. I get that it's not meant to be a psychological thriller horror experience but it could just have easily been if Phil saw life differently.
Think about it, he basically started out as a narcissistic asshole but became a completely changed man by the end of it. Because deep down i believe he was always a redeemable person.

However, how he was able to come out of that loop a psychologically stable person with no issues is beyond me. Just by the fact that he knew how to play the piano on an expert level, became an expert ice sculptor, he knew everything about everyone down to the intimate level. In order to be proficient in the skills shown he would have needed at least a decade each to master each skill individually and decades more to be proficient in them. I'm going to guess here and say he spent at least a thousand years in that loop. I mean at some point he tried taking his own life unsuccessfully, which means he was pushed to the most extremes of trauma. I just cannot imagine the horror, I don't think hell could be worse than that. At some point every human interaction to him would feel like a script. No matter how much you love a movie, if you have to watch it everyday for a thousand years or so, you will grow to hate it. There could be some sort of nihilistic undertones here. I understand that the movie uses the loop as a path towards self improvement which really softens the horrific vibe of the film, but if Phil never chose that path, it could have easily been one of the most nightmarish, dark twisted terrifying exploration on isolation and futility. I'm honestly surprised there aren't more films exploring this angle.",normal

2) I'm not psyched about it but probably gonna go as I like comedies and so few get released in theaters atm. 

3) The trailer to me looked weird I thought it looked like a streaming movie it had that washed out tv streaming look to it. And then I just found out it was actually made to be streaming but it had good scores in test screenings so they changed their minds.

"Birdman.  Rewatched it tonight.  I really like this movie because it gets my brain fired up and it feels like it aims high.  I am sort of stumbling on my own takeaway and wanna share it with you for discussion.  Granted I may get absolute torn up in this discussion. Please be gentle. If you have not yet seen this movie then this is not a discussion for you. 
    
It‚Äôs been about a hour after I watched it and my mind is still kinda buzzing. Because I think the movie is about sincerity and our fear of it.  Please bear with me.  
 
 What do we mean when we talk about love?

Keaton starting off the movie levitating  is such a delicious opening shot.  You are in a surreal experience and informed of that right at the start.  Reality is always in question.

Then the meta layers in this movie are so thick.  Keaton is of course the former Batman/Birdman.  So your mind already connects that. Norton is famous for being a real life pain in the ass. So your mind steps back a second time at that. The uncut camera trick makes you aware a third time that you are seeing movie magic and yet more unreality.  

It feels to me as though it is setting up this hyper complex meta mystery box and yet at key moments it returns to the play. The choice of Carver representing a straight and real story that is credible.

The feeling overall for me becomes this. The movie is an attack on meta commentary. It‚Äôs an attack on mystery box style movies that have mind blowing twists. Of course it does this by presenting its own twists and turns of unreality.

But in the end I guess what I‚Äôm getting out of it is that we can no longer handle a straight story. We have to have our minds blown by shocking twists and turns. We need to insulate ourselves from the story and emotion by having a puzzle to solve.

And we are presented with the last puzzle to solve as we have romantic crescendo music rising and falling and sharply cutting off.  False endings and dramatic twists and turns.

We can not handle a simple Carver story anymore.  We need absurd plot twists to insulate ourselves from sincere emotion.  We need to be removed from direct emotion.  

All of my friends are super annoyed because whenever I watch this movie I talk about it and everyone is super bored of hearing me speculate.  I hope this rambling made some sense.  Maybe I‚Äôm completely wrong in how I‚Äôm viewing it.  Maybe I‚Äôm doing a poor job of interpreting it.  

Tear me up.  ",normal
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. And Westerns. I rewatched this great movie recently.  I have always been a fan of the genre..and I mean this in a purist sense.  The theme of the conflict of westward expansion of civilization vs. the idea of lost individualism.  Is the civilization of the wild worth the loss the mythical exceptional individual?  Shane explains this theme better than any other western and I think you see start to see more exploration and revisionism afterwards like great The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance that explores this theme even further.   This brings me to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  The first that really brings this movie into the modern era and fantastic revisionist for the theme.  It's reflective, humanizing, intense and beautiful from the first black and white silent reel to the final freeze-frame.  It's held up easily as one of the best movies Ive watched all time but I think some of that comes from the context of knowing where the movie is coming from and the themes it so intelligently explores.  But even as I watched this as a kid before I actually watched the other movies I listed, it was incredible.  The chemistry between the two leads is unmatched.

I think I just wanted to highly recommend it again today (along with the other movies I mentioned).  There is a sadness to it now as back even into the 70s there was still a strong ideal of individual exceptionalism and self reliance running in America that older people might remember that has been gone for decades now.  Butch Cassidy is in many ways the epitaph for that ideal that has in many ways been replaced now with superhero movies and sci fi that mythologizes the individual with godlike beings.  Granted I am a huge fan of these movies as well but they lack the internal conflicting question these westerns had.  Shane says yes.  The sacrifice is worth it.  There can be no more guns in the valley.  Liberty Valance makes you question it.  Is the sacrifice of the Tom Donaphins, who have held the picket line worth the life of the inevitable civilizing Ransom Stoddarts? I think Butch Cassidy finally looks back and says poignantly ""no"".  What has been lost was a kind of freedom and humanity that has not been adequately replaced by railroads.  

I rarely see this movie mentioned these days.  All of these movies are among the best and thoughtful American cinema has ever produced.  When discussing westerns today, people mention the Good the Bad and the Ugly, Unforgiven, Tombstone etc.  All excellent movies but they are excellent movies set in the western period.  They (especially movies like Unforgiven, the Outlaw Josey Wales, etc.) explore their own complex themes but, specifically, discussing westerns they are not a discussion on the disappearing idea of individualism in America that was happening in the 50s-70s.  I wonder if the modern audience can relate to this or understand the loss or the complex internal ambivalence about what was sacrificed and what was gained.",normal

**1999:**¬†**American Beauty**¬†(Role: Lester Burham) (Actor who got it: Kevin Spacey) (Reason: Chevy was the 1st choice for the lead, but he turned it down as he didn‚Äôt like the content and out of fear that it would hurt his family-friendly image)

**2007:**¬†**Alvin & The Chipmunks**¬†(Role: Dave Seville) (Actor who got it: Jason Lee) (Reason: At some point during development, Chevy was considered for the role)

Ultimately, I think Chevy Chase is a good actor, but I think he was his own worst enemy and really had lost potential. He really could have had bigger success but from everywhere I read about the guy, he had a really massive ego and was very difficult to work. I feel it‚Äôs a shame, I think Chevy could of done more things, and really could of ventured into drama.

"Coherence (2013) is the best mind f*ck movie I‚Äôve seen in a long time  Stumbled across this movie on a random post about the movie Fraility about month ago, finally watched it tonight and absolutely loved it.

"The Tomorrow War can't decide what kind of movie it wants to be I know this movie is a few years old, but I just watched today and I want to talk about it. 

There have been plenty of discussions on here about the time travel in The Tomorrow War, and whether or not the mechanics of it all hold together and if there are paradoxes or plot holes. I don't want to rehash those discussions.

I want to talk about the genre/motif/feel of the movie. I feel like it can't decide what it wants to be. It's trying to be Arrival, Terminator, and Aliens at the same time, and those three things are fighting each other. There are bits of the movie that are using sci-fi tropes to explore poinient emotional family dynamics (like Arrival), while other parts of the movie lean into the trippy time travel mystery thriller thing (like Terminator), but then big chunks of the film are just balls out action packed soldiers vs alien monsters sequences - complete with a ""queen"" alien that's bigger, smarter, and harder to kill than the rest (like Aliens). All of these different styles kind of clash with each other throughout the movie and feel disjointed. It could have worked as any one of these genres, they just needed to pick one and stick with it.

Curious what others think about the film making (not the plot or the premise or the time travel mechanics) of this movie

ETA: I do want to give it credit for not being a sequel, prequel, reboot, spin-off, or adaptation. It was its own thing and that is getting rarer and rarer, especially in high budget sci-fi action. ",normal

"M Night Shyamalan's Trap felt more unrealistic than killer plants Just finished Trap and am so confused. How was this allowed? Couldn't they have given the guy a face scar or something and ""new evidence points to perp having face scar?"" Honestly, there's no reason dude couldn't have just, like, walked out.

Or maybe if the venue/location had been a far more private event, maybe government related? His kid's being awarded something by some politician with a huge group of other kids. Just anything where the *audacity* and lack of rights could be overlooked at least a little bit.

Honestly, I love me some M.K.S. Even the ""bad stuff,"" but this movie was too unbelievable. I would sooner believe that there was a woman living in my pool than anything in this movie happening. Harnett playing a psychopath was the only good and even remotely engrossing thing in this almost 2 hour film.

What *really* got me though was the comment about only letting women and children through during a fire alarm. Like ma'am, WHAT?? 

""Hello, lawyer? I was caught up in some Titanic bullshit. A fire alarm went off and I couldn't leave because I'm a man. They had no good reason to keep me tho. Is this legal?""

""Hello, lawyer? A fire alarm went off but I couldn't leave because I'm a man. I panicked because I thought I was about to burned alive so I assaulted an armed police officer and I was severely injured. A riot actually broke out. The guy next to me was shot and killed. There was mass hysteria and confusion and the guys with the guns got scared and stupid. So like, who all can I sue for this?

Hello, lawyer? A fire alarm went off but I couldn't leave because I'm a man. I was with my 8 year old daughter. Things were chaotic and scary with everyone leaving at once. I told her to go without me because I didn't want her to burn to death. I told her to wait for me at X location, but she got lost because of the chaos and because she's 8. Now she's kidnapped and presumed dead. I'd like to sue, like, 47 people please. Also, I'm suicidal now and my wife left me.

Hello, lawyer? I'm a mom and I was recently at the Lady Raven concert. There was a fire alarm and I couldn't get out because they were holding men back. It clogged up the lines and caused fights. My children and I couldn't get out at all There was an actual fire during all this and now I'm dead. I'd like to find out who was responsible so I can haunt them. 


Ways that the dad could have escaped:

Just walked out. ""Am I being detained? No? Because you have no real evidence? Cool, please move."" 

Run out saying loved one is dying and they have minutes left. 

Run out saying wife is in labor. 

Steal Raven's inhaler. Crush it. Go to an exit, fake an asthma attack and then say it's not working and you need to get your car/hospital. 

When dressed up like food stand guy, just walk out when you already had the card and password. 

Actually injure yourself and leave via ambulance.

Flirt back with Legolas' cousin and leave with him. 

Use your murder skills to get a woman unconscious, steal her clothes, leave in drag. Or steal clothes from backstage. 

Go ahead and call in the bomb threat, but to the mall down the street. They'll only have Hayley Mills and venue security left on site after that. 

I could go on and on.

They can't just detain a random guy because of 1 or 2 shared similarities. And they *definitely* can't hold a whole hoard of people for that reason. 

Distractingly unbelievable. 

And don't get me started on telling the celebrity who you are and then the police taking this guy down with tasers??",normal

"Doing a once-a-week movie marathon through 2025 and need some recommendations! r/movies, I come to you in a time of great need.

  
I've begun planning my new year's resolution; to watch a movie a week for the entirety of 2025. I'll be documenting them and will post them somewhere (if it can be posted here I'd love to know, if not I'll comment here about places it could be found.) I decided I wanted to make 2025 the year I tackled a lot of movies I hadn't seen yet, and there are so many out there that I could watch that i've begun to get Choice paralysis haha!

  
When it comes to recommending for me; I come with a unique advantage/disadvantage; I have seen very few movies. Maybe 30 in my lifetime, outside of the basic Marvel movies and things I watched when I was a kid. As an adult, [These are the movies I recall that I've watched](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Vwh4qW7gLSxdxD1xNVXkvuOFBfs_rV_AeIfdHM3zsQ/edit?usp=sharing). I really enjoy watching movies, but Typically I'd prefer to play a video game. Next year though, I want to flip that, and watch a bunch of movies in my spare time.

  
In addition to the link featuring my seen-movie history, here's a brief summary of some of the things i enjoy.

* Scorcese is absolutely my favourite director, as Casino is my favourite movie ever with Goodfellas as a close second.
* I can sometimes enjoy a good football movie, as I'm a football fan. Movies i've seen include The Program and Any Given Sunday.
* In terms of the major series i've watched in my adult years, I've seen LOTR and Star Wars.
* I've recently gotten into the Horror genre, and my favourite movie I've watched this year was Longlegs. 
* I really enjoy movies with twist endings, like >!Usual Suspects, The Village, and Sixth Sense.!< 
* I can enjoy a good comedy movie as well, with movies like Airplane! and The Naked Gun being some personal Favourites.
* I also love animation, so movies like A Silent Voice are also welcome! I currently have some Studio Ghibli stuff on my hitlist that will likely get added to the list of movies, but i'd still love any recommendations for some good animated movies.
* Additionally, I have access to free movies at the cinemas, so if there is a movie that is coming out that you think would fit this list, please let me know! I don't really keep up with new releases anymore so i'd love to know if they're something coming down the pipe I may enjoy!

I already also have a watchlist that includes movies like Spirited Away, The Thing, Joker, some classic horror movies like Nightmare On Elm St. and Friday the 13th, Pulp Fiction, The Dark Knight and Terminator 2. 



If anyone has any suggestions for my weekly movies for 2025, I'd love to hear them! I'm currently filling out a schedule of movies, and when it's done i'll be happy to share! I'm looking forward to beginning this journey with you all, and I hope this will allow me to enjoy movies more than ever before!",normal

"Hoping for help to find the name of this 80s-90s movie Marked this as a spoiler as the part that stands out to me is the end and really want to find this movie again. Here's the gist I remember

In this film, the protagonist is approached and asked to do something by a man to aid the war effort agains the enemy.  But along the way the man discovers that he's really aiding the enemy and then has to escape to the enemy country, only to discover that the conflict has been fabricated. The ending features a significant twist where they learn the truth from a contact, revealing that the supposed enemy has been defeated, and the ongoing facade of the war is maintained for control but the 'enemy' has been defeated. And the guy that reached out to the protagonist is really working for the government and pulling the strings.

The ending is basically where the protagonist and his female partner are left in the defeated country and the bad guy flies off back to the original country.

It's driving me nuts. The bad guy essentially has a story about how they defeated the enemy years ago but keep the war going to maintain control. It was a mind trip for me...as kid.",normal
"Movies with an inarticulate main character  Recently, while watching season three of The Bear, I noticed how bad Carmy is at expressing his feelings. With the exception of that remarkable speech at the support group, most of his lines are made up of awkward, stilted dialogue and angry outbursts. The scenes with his late brother Michael reinforce this, because he comes off as eloquent and gregarious while Carmy is a perfectionist loner.   

This type of character makes The Bear a perfect example of ‚Äúshow, don‚Äôt tell.‚Äù We discover his story mostly through flashbacks, small details and the reactions of the ensemble cast.    

Anyhow this train of thought got me into thinking about films with the same kind of focus. How many movies can you think of where the main character is unable, or unwilling to explain themselves for the sake of the plot? Or this could be simply a character that gets few lines on the screen. I think movies with that kind of constraint would have to have a solid, compelling story to work.",normal

"In 'The Trial Of The Chicago', Jeremy Strong asks Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the Prosecutor, if they teach 'them' (the establishment) a joke about the French & Eggs and JGL replies 'Yup.' Why? As stated in the title, Jeremy Strong (JS)'s character asks Joseph Gordon-Levitt (JGL), who is the prosecutor, at roughly 01:07:50:

JS: Is that even ethical? Aren't there ethics rules?

JGL Did she engage with you sexually?

JS We were taking it slow...

Sacha-Baron Cohen (SBC): He's (JS) going to be alright.

JS: One egg is *un oeuf*? They teach you that at the academy?

JGL: '... Yup.'

Why would JGL say '**Yup**'?

The academy, I suspect, is the establishment JGL, and the Lady-Mole, beloved by JS, belong to, but of course - an undercover police officer and a prosecutor have vastly different educational and work-cultural norms and jokes.

Is he just agreeing to placate / indulge JS and be slightly cheeky? Probably, but then that would imply he understood what 'Un Oeuf' out of context means.

So it's either something genuinely widespread and understood in that 'establishment' culture or he did not understand what JS was referring to or even meant, and JGL just wanted to placate him.

Both of those options sound fairly reasonable. **However.**

If it's the former, can you imagine all of that old-school, prejudiced, all-powerful, and in control, establishment telling each other this joke about an egg - 'Un Oeuf' in French..

It's a wild concept.

Or, again, he did not understand. Which might be fair enough.

But then imagine his perspective - some oddball, heartbroken, slightly pathetic (in the classical sense), but nonetheless very human, courageous, and deeply empathetic guy you're prosecuting suddenly asks about *an* *egg.*

In French.

Pronounced in yet another slightly weird, but very committed, manner by JS.

And he does not ask any questions - he just accepts what he has been told.

**Yup.**

"Green Room had some top tier writing moments  Minor spoilers ahead. 

Just recently did a re-watch and while the movie is good overall there is one (or two) scenes that had me in awe with how unexpectedly good and ""real"" the writing was.

The first one being right after that faithful moment where the main character went back into the room to find the dead girl. He called 911, stuttered something about a stabbing before the bad guy got a hold of his phone and hung up. 
The bad guy then instantly called 911 again to tell them some lies so no police would show up. 

Or that's what I thought would happen! 
Instead he did in fact confirm that there was a stabbing and he just lost connection. They then paid some club members to stage an actual non-fatal stab wound (with a knife length just below of what would get them in real trouble), so they have a convincing story to tell the police. 
And it makes so much sense! Every other excuse he could have come up with would only have made the cops more suspicious and send someone over anyways. 

To me that was just a stroke of genius in term of writing and subverting expectations. 

Similarly I loved how the girl later COMPLETELY missed the shot at that dog sprinting at here. Because OF COURSE she would not hit in a stress situation like that with no gun experience
It's just a minor thing but unexpectedly realistic scenes like that made an already pretty good movie great.

"Is Psycho a prime example of a movie of it‚Äôs time ? So in the spirit of Halloween I watched Psycho for the first time ever this week. 

I will start by saying it‚Äôs a great film. I do not think it‚Äôs bad or am looking to trash it. My point here is for how renowned it is, and how it is atop a lot of people‚Äôs  horror films and even fave films in general lists, I definitely left feeling like it is somewhat overrated. 

The acting and cinematography I felt was top notch for the most part. (I especially loved the shots that included the taxidermy birds. )

I had obviously seen the iconic shower scene but i knew nothing else about the film, especially the ending. 


My main gripes with the film are as followed:

1. Maybe the most common take of a lot of viewers taking this sort of position, but the film leans thriller/suspense vs ‚Äòscary‚Äô. Horror filmmaking evolved so much, and I know this film inspired so many horror films since, but I don‚Äôt think I can say I felt ‚Äúscared‚Äù at many points except 1 or 2. But I can def see it being scary for people in 1960. 

2. This is probably my biggest gripe but I didn‚Äôt find the twist to be all that shocking , like at all. Again , idk if it‚Äôs because I have seen a lot of movies at this point but the ending became quite obvious for 2 reasons. 1) you never see Norman and his mother in the same scene together (besides him carrying her down the stairs) . While it adds mystery , it is also obvious that Hitchcock is hiding something here. 2) the film is literally called Psycho, lol. To me, that meant there is going to be some ‚Äòpsychotic‚Äô reveal at some point. And once the sheriff explains the mother died years ago, ‚ÄúNorman being a schizophrenic‚Äù  was a pretty immediate thought for me. I will say, the reveal of him in the garb was probably the scariest part of the film, but it literally lasts 10 seconds and the acting of him being subdued is pretty horrible and borderline comical, to a point where it kinda ruined the reveal for me. 

3. The debated scene of the psychiatrist explaining to everyone in the most literal sense what we all just watched. I am not sure if this was a more common device in filmmaking back then, but it definitely felt like ‚Äúoh this scene is for people who have no understanding of what happened‚Äù. It was another scene that kinda took me out of the experience. 

There are other small plot devices I felt were very stupid unless I missed something  (i.e how is Norman just leaving Cabin 1 unlocked after the murder ???)

So overall, it is a great film but seems like it is more renowned for what it did at the time vs really holding up in certain critical ways. While they were made later I feel like The Excorcist or Rosemary‚Äôs Baby are much better ‚Äòhorror‚Äô films.

"Does anybody remember this movie?  I remember this early 2000‚Äôs movie that I keep confusing with House of Sand and Fog, where the character I believe was a woman and an investigator. She meets a man that helps her solve the mystery by showing her his ‚Äúpsychic‚Äù abilities? The ability consisted of being able to deduce details of a crime scene simply by thinking, ‚Äúoh, what did this person‚Äôs room look like?‚Äù or something similar, and then they close their eyes and they imagine this space but it turns out that how they imagine it, is exactly how it went down.

"How do genre thrillers movies like Amber Alert and Take Cover make the majority of their money? 5 months ago in this [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/1cj8xm2/making_money_with_independent_films_in_2024) people mentioned about making money on genre films, but the answers weren't conclusive. 

So what about if I use case studies like Amber Alert and Take Cover? [Amber Alert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aCr7-oJ0JQ) is a thriller with Hayden Panatierre and Tyler James Williams and [Take Cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boeiStdXJuE) is an action movie with Scott Adkins. 

How do these films make all their money back? Is video on demand enough? Do they still pre-sell films and get their budget for the movie from different investors based on who's starring in it? It can't be for territories anymore as video on demand is almost worldwide and Netflix and Amazon Prime Video want to buy worldwide rights to movies. I think even studios like Lionsgate and Universal want to buy movies to add them to their catalogue and release them as Home Premieres. 

If a producer makes a $10 million horror or thriller, would they sell the movie directly to a subscription streamer or pay-TV channel (branding as an ""X"" original) for a one or two stage payment? Or video on demand alongside licensing it to pay-TV movie channels then movie packages to general cable and network TV?",normal

I have no idea what he's talking about in his Anora review. It feels super bizarre and nit-picky. He likes the movie but criticizes Baker for just being a director? And says he's acting more like a producer with Anora? To me, for instance, this is a slightly absurd criticism that you can level against most movies:

""But the talk always fits into the plot like cogs in a machine. Baker has a finely tuned story sense‚Äîthe machine runs efficiently, and the characters are essentially workers enlisted to keep it running. Their emotional lives don‚Äôt factor into the movie except to the extent that they serve the cause; there‚Äôs no side chatter, no offhand conversation, and they don‚Äôt break the framework of their function to delve deep into experiences, memories, ambitions, dreams, and ideas.""

And even weirder is this remark:

""The characters move within even the grittiest spaces as if walking past backdrops or C.G.I. green screens. What‚Äôs missing from ‚ÄúAnora‚Äù isn‚Äôt the characters‚Äô physical contact with locations but their mental contact. Baker never lets them express what they know or think about the places they inhabit.""

Which I had ZERO sense watching the movie. I'm not even sure how you would want Baker to write that in.

Someone please parse.

Update: 
Anora does have its shortcomings, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair nor helpful to criticize a director for rigorously carrying out his vision, which Brody contends is Baker‚Äôs flaw (I.e. ‚Äúoverbearingly self produced‚Äù). Granted I‚Äôm not expert but that seems quite tricky to delineate. I see that being a strength in other contexts.

"I think I figured out the target in Top Gun Maverick First the obvious disclaimer: in the spirit of ""TG:M is a Greatest Hits album"", the target for The Mission is conspicuously un-named, much as in the original. It is *intended* to be un-knowable: it's not actually important to the story, it's better to sell the movie internationally, and it's a fun easter egg. The enemy airfield coordinates (briefly on screen) [even point to Point Nemo](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/x480j3/in_top_gun_maverick_2022_the_coordinates_for_the/), the spot in the middle of the ocean farthest from any land on earth.

ALL THAT SAID, I say it's ""intended"" to be unknown, but there's enough detail to figure it out anyway. Others have tried before, but with [all deference to the fine folks at The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/movies/2022/6/3/23151745/top-gun-maverick-enemy-country) (a site I love), I think their conclusions are wrong.

The start of this rabbit-hole comes from the MacGuffin mission briefing speech (MacMission? MacGuffion?) that Warlock delivers when Maverick first arrives back ~~in purgatory~~ at North Island. As the fella says (emphasis mine):

>Warlock: Theee target... is an unsanctioned uranium plant built in violation of a **multilateral NATO TREATY**

And there it is. I'd watched this a dozen times before that hit my ears. It's a *NATO* treaty. Not a UN resolution, not a multinational agreement, a NATO treaty. **ETA: This is why it's not Iran (per The Ringer's logic above) - Iran is not a signatory to NATO treaties.**

Why does this matter? To violate a treaty, you have to be a *signatory* to that treaty. And if it's a NATO treaty, the signatories are **NATO members** ([ETA: this guy agrees](https://opiniojuris.org/2022/10/26/top-gun-maverick-international-law-empire-and-nostalgia/)). And just like that, we've narrowed down the list of potential targets from >200 to 30 in 2022. Let's get to work.

First to get a small detail out of the way: I am not an expert (nor even an amateur) in international military politics. Article 5 of the NATO charter provides for unified military action against attacks on any individual member. This doesn't seem to **explicitly** outlaw military action by one member (here: the US) against another - for the silliness of this thought experiment, we can accept the ""rogue state control"" to mean that there is a breakaway region in a member state, and the others have agreed to take action against it (with the accession of the non-rogue part of that country). It's a stretch, but not an impossibility.

The movie gives us 3 key pieces to start whittling the list:

1. The target 's geography
   1. Is on the ocean
   2. Has mountains directly next to the coast
   3. Is accessible from the ocean by aircraft carrier
   4. Has meaningful snow-cover in the winter at the foot of those mountains
      * Don't get confused by Dog Fight Football - San Diego has tarps-off beach weather year-round
2. The target has sufficient political instability to facilitate a ""rogue state""/breakaway region
3. The target has *credible* access to a ""5th gen fighter"" - while it isn't named, it's not a US plane, and the NATO theater means this basically HAS to be the Su-57 Felon

Let's start knocking them down

* 0. We know it's not the US, 29 left
* 1.1 eliminates 5 landlocked members (Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, North Macedonia, Luxembourg), 24 left
* 1.2 eliminates 12 flat-coast countries (the 3 Baltics, Poland, Germany, Denmark Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania), 12 left
* 1.3 eliminates 1 (Bulgaria) - no carriers in the Black Sea, 11 left
* 1.4 eliminates 1 (Greece) barring really weird weather - 10 left
* 2. is cuts out all 7 [very stable countries](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PV.PER.RNK) (Iceland, UK, France, Spain, Italy, Norway, Canada), 3 left

That leaves us with access to the Felon and 3 countries: Albania, Montenegro, and Turkey. There is a small amount of judgement here, but I think we have enough to make the call: Russia isn't realistically giving it's ""definitely real and not a model"" prize aircraft to anyone, but they're especially not giving it to a country that they can only get to by going through other NATO countries. This, coupled with the *relatively* higher level of political stability in Albania and Montenegro lead us to 1 inevitable conclusion:

"What are your thoughts on Robert Zemeckis? Are his movies too sentimental and mainstream? One of my favorite movies from Robert Zemeckis is ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"". It's a small movie about a group of fans chasing after the Beatles who are coming to America to show up at the Ed Sullivan Show. 

It was funny, engaging and unpredictable and many of the actors in the movie ended up being in Zemeckis' more popular movies. 

But as mainstream as his movies got, they also became formulaic and sentimental and unsurprising. 

Zemeckis did experiment by exploring other avenues, like CGI animation or having live action interact with animation, but when it comes to story, his movies couldn't be more square, more run of the mill. 

He made movies for the masses, sheer entertainment, and there's nothing wrong with that, but there's nothing wrong in going small, in challenging oneself as a writer.",normal
"Horror Roulette - Drag Me to Hell : First Viewing Video: https://youtu.be/nKaT8ZKgdu8?si=DHC9-QTyvLnbTy6w

Skip to 2:45 For review

Below is the written script that was altered and changed when delivered in the video. Some on the grammar may be wonky so forgive me.
 
Review: 

So this was interesting. I‚Äôll start by saying that going into this film, the extent of knowledge I had on Sam Raimi‚Äô filmography began and ended with his marvel movies. Now his Spider-Man Trilogy is a favorite of mine, which is something I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll express in a future video, and I even appreciated his Doctor Strange Film for what it was. The horror elements he brings in his camerawork and directing is really impressive even if Disnified. Something I always appreciate about Raimis filmmaking is his movement with the camera and his directing style as a whole. The Spider-Man films set a precedent for superhero films and a lot of that is credit to Raimi, but before I let that tangent grow more than it should, my point being is I have yet to truly experience ‚ÄòSam Raimi, the Horror director‚Äô. Now before the horror community crucifies me in the comments, I do think it's important to note that I‚Äôm waiting for Evil Dead to be selected in Horror Roulette, so I can give the most genuine reaction at the time. 
But what did I think of this PG-13 Horror flick? UHHHHHHH it‚Äôs um. Yanno there‚Äôs a lot to like about it. As previously mentioned, my biggest focus going in was this film as an inclusion in Raimi‚Äôs filmography. And with that I have to say he does continue to impress. I felt the biggest highlights was how Sam shot the horror sequences in particular. His camera movements and blocking in this film does a great job when building suspense and genuine terror at moments, or at least the direct threat of evil. There‚Äôs sequences like Christine being cursed in the parking garage by MrsGanush that I feel has genuinely great scares through the use of shadows and blocking and other super fun film buzzwords I‚Äôll use to convince you I know what I'm talking about :) Or  later during the curse when Christine has a vision of Mrs. Ganush appearing in her bed, really really creepy sequences, super effectively shot. Now to stay on the path of positive for just a bit, I also just think the overall premise of the film begins really strong. You have your main protagonist, a businesswoman trying to earn the respect of her boss, and by doing this is now the victim of some ancient gypsy curse. Pretty fucking rad if you ask me. 
Now‚Ä¶ my tone is certainly gonna switch just a little but stay with me. I really enjoyed the film for about the first 1.5-2 acts. I think it starts strong with the ideas it brings and the horror begins being really effective, but then the ending kinda gets to the levels of bat-shit. And that‚Äôs fine, I mean I enjoy Halloween 6 from time to time, but I much more enjoyed the set up than the pay off for this one. I also think it‚Äôs important to note that this film has a ton of camp which is staple for Raimi to my understanding. This wasn‚Äôt an issue for me and I don‚Äôt want to credit that to the bat shitery I mentioned. No, the aspects of the film that I particularly found silly was just how the stakes in this film increase exponentially throughout the film, and the scares grow more and more out there with some of them being effective while others were not really. The majority of the horror sequences I didn‚Äôt enjoy in this, I can point to one particular reason as to why and thats the CGI. I try not to be the guy that complains about poor CGI but when you have sequences like the Mrs. Ganush‚Äôs arm in Christines throat I can‚Äôt go without at least saying it‚Äôs dated. It‚Äôs especially frustrating when this film HAS physical props and practical effects and are effective in their use. The overall story is also super messy, especially with the inclusion Rham Jas, a hole in the wall fortune teller played by Dileep Rao, who has all the knowledge of the curse and spiritual threats that Christine has to face, but tells the information to her in fragments and has connections to the demon bounty hunter woman from the beginning, who also just kinda has to get thrown in the the third act of this film for the climax.
 Yet even so, I can‚Äôt say I was ever checked out of this film except for one specific element that I think was the biggest distraction for me, and that was the entire subplot around Justin Long‚Äôs Character Clay. Clay is Christine‚Äôs successful, generationally wealthy, supportive boyfriend who begins not really understanding what Christine is going through but never really negative towards HER about it. He more so just wants to understand and what I would consider as supportive even if skeptic. They try to make him seem shitty by how skeptical and I guess you could say disrespectful he is during Christine‚Äôs Initial visit with Rham, but even so his character‚Äôs inclusion never bothered me. That is until one scene where Christine has an outburst as she‚Äôs being teased by the demon curse while at dinner with Clay‚Äôs family. Clay then kinda leave‚Äôs the picture for a while, as Christine further investigates and finds out she needs like $10,000 to reach the demon bounty hunter lady, sells all her possessions to go so, this movie get‚Äôs fucking wild, and i‚Äôm not even mentioning the fucking kitten thing. And when she‚Äôs about to give up because she just short of the money she needs, fuckin CLay swoops back in and is just like ‚Äúhere‚Äôs the money, oh btw I believe you.‚Äù

COOL GUY!
But other than that element, I never officially checked myself out of this film even through it‚Äôs silliness. Other factors at play is there‚Äôs some stiff acting at play specifically from our lead, but there‚Äôs enough good scares in this and genuinely great and horrific scenes to make this one worth a revisit at some point. While on the topic I do intend on putting films from the first watch slice into the rewatch slice, after some time has passed of course. I think it could be fun to return to a film and catalog any changes in my opinions. The circumstances around this were nice too, I of course watched it with my girlfriend which is always nice. And while I don‚Äôt think she particularly loved it, I think it was a fun experience for the both of us. That final scene especially had us going, iykyk. But that‚Äôs about all I really gotta say about this film, I think it could be especially fun in a group setting, not a film that's gonna knock your socks off but a fun ride nonetheless. Grade: C

Some examples of mine would be A Scanner Darkly, Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, Shawshank Redemption, Lord of the Rings, Dune, and Dune. (Honourable mention is the show Hannibal, which really ran with it, but it's a show so doesn't count)",normal

"Favorite movie by european country: Belarus Hello there,

again, I'm only my filmic journey across Europe. Everyday, I ask you for the most papular movie that is set in a certain european country. Yesterday it was Azerbaijan's turn, and I'm happy to announce that it wasn't *The World is not enough* that won, but a genuinely Azerbaijani film: ***Yuxu***. I haven't seen it before, but now it's definitely on my watch list - just like Babak, for example.

The next stop - I'm going alphabetically - is in Eastern Europe: We're now finally leaving the letter A and go to **Belarus** instead. As in the previous days, please note the following information:

* It's about where the film is set and less about whether it was filmed there. Sometimes, especially when it's really hard to find any movie, it is also fine if only a certain part of the film is set in the respective country.
* After 24 hours, the winner is the film that is then named in the respective top comment. For this purpose, I ask you to only name one film per comment and to make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. Anything else would simply not fit in with the voting system - so thanks in advance!

I'm really looking forward to your film suggestions!

>Day 5: Azerbaijan - Yuxu

>Day 4: Austria - Funny Games

>Day 3: Armenia - ’Ü’º’°’∂ ’£’∏÷Ç’µ’∂’® (engl. The Color of Pomegranade)

"Favorite action star from Hong Kong cinema? Even as a Westerner living in North America, for a lot of us we grew up watching the Hong Kong film stars such as:

\- Jackie Chan 

\- Jet Li

\- Tony Jaa

\- Andy Lau

\- Donnie Yen

  
and of course the infamous Bruce Lee. 

Who is your absolute favorite and why? I've always loved Jet Li and maintain that Once Upon a Time in China is one of the best films ever.",normal
"There‚Äôs no actual funny scripts anymore I‚Äôve been rewatching a lot of 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs comedies, and what strikes me today is that the comedy films being made are not well-crafted the way they used to be. Look at Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, for instance. They should have hired Paul Rudnick, but instead they hired‚Ä¶ the creators of Smallville.

We‚Äôre not getting new classics because Hollywood isn‚Äôt putting the work into its scripts the way they used to.

As someone who thrives off movies, personally it‚Äôs really disheartening to think that maybe this is it. Maybe we‚Äôll get one or two good ‚Äòfluke‚Äô comedies every few decades from now on and that‚Äôs it.

And to be honest, now more than ever, I feel like we need them in society. Maybe they‚Äôre actually IMPORTANT to society. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Just a thought.",normal

"It's no superhero fatique. It's just that the superhero boom might be over I think you already know this but in the late 90's - early 2000's, there was an abundance of comic book movies, some classics like Blade, Spider-Man 1-3, and the X-Men movies. As the years have passed, the wave has gotten bigger, with the iconic Dark Knight Trilogy, and the MCU (and ig the DCEU too). We reached a point in the late 2010's when these movies were money printing machines. It didnt matter if your movie was a mediocre slogfest with D tier comic book characters, it was mostly gonna make double or triple of it's initial budget. 

But now we live in a world where this era is over. With some expections, we've seen so many of these movies end up financial failures. Even movies that 5 years ago would've made billions of dollars, now it seems like superhero movies are competing for the title of the worst performing movie.

A lot of people might say that this is the result of the superhero fatique. Basically, people are just sick of superheroes, supervillains, and pretty much anything resembling a comic book movie is avoided like the plague. 

At a surface level, you might say that this is true. With movies like Joker 2, The Marbles,  Morbius, Madame Web, Thor Love and Thunder, Black Adam (and pretty much every single post Aquaman DCEU movie).  All of these movies were embarrassing failures.

But since I'm on this subreddit, I think we can agree that this is just not true. It's not that superhero movies are avoided, but that they lost the superpower to be money printing machines. There isnt anything special about Marvel movies and DC movies anymore, it doesn't matter if your movie is part of some connedted universe, or even if it's a sequel to a highly successful movie. 

Superhero/comic book movies have become just another genre of movies. When Hollywood is about to release a superhero movie, they need to polish it and market it like it's any other movie. They need to actually put effort into making a movie people will spend their hard earned money to see on the big screen. The only difference between a Marvel movie and some action movie starring a washed out actor is that these movies have absurdly high budgets, and that they might stir some political discussion that most of the goes nowhere and after it's over they just throw in the trash (exceot for Hollywood since the forced performative progressive ideologies have been proven to be painful for the box office income of these movies).

In general we could say that nowadays, people will go watch a movie only if they really want to go watch. Gone are the days people were about to spend money seeing a B movie cause they're bored. And there's nothing wrong with watching less popular movies, just saying that people are very picky about what they're about to watch. If your movie has a chappy marketing campaign or got itself into some controversy, you might as well not release that movie. It's actually pretty fascinating. It's like a battle where only the strongest will come out. It's a harsh competition, and no movie is getting spared from the wrath of the audience. 

Yes, people like you. You have the power to influence the movie industry. Your wallet has more power than you would think. You are the judge. You got the power, so use it wisely.

"Jio Cinema blurs a frontal nude scene in Good Luck To You, Leo Grande, a film on body positivity!  I watched a fantastic film called Good Luck to You, Leo Grande, on Jio Cinema yesterday. The cinephile in me is giddy with joy when he sees such wonderful 'small' films on popular platforms like Jio Cinema, which also hosts Big Boss (you will know the difference if you are from India) .

Now, I am not going to spoil the film for you, but it's a brave take on sexual exploration, body positivity, and a tender bond that develops between a young sex worker and an old-school teacher.

The film is a series of conversations that are so intelligently woven together that it qualifies for some of the best writing that I have come across. The film reminded me of the Before trilogy in parts too, but the setting made it more intimate and personal.

Now imagine, watching a film on body positivity and the OTT platform you decide to watch it on, deciding to blur all the nude scenes. The entire point of the film is to own your body. Be content with your sexuality. Accept yourself with all the flaws that you have.

Yet, the custodians of culture decided to blur a full frontal nude scene of Emma Thompson, an actor in her 60s, who probably has given her best in this film.

Yet, I am reminded that no, you have no right to see an old woman feeling liberated for the first time in her body because they aren't part of our culture!

No wonder most women in India fake orgasms their entire life.",normal

"Imagine you are Curtis Hanson and Eminem hands you the lyrics to Lose Yourself as a title track to your movie. What is going through your mind? I mean that is clearly one of the all time, stand out, make the movie, hits. I should point out that Hanson portrayed that perfectly in 8 mile. 

What other title tracks define a movie? I am specifically talking about songs, not instrumental soundtracks. 

Kenny Loggin's Danger zone for Top Gun is up there, Whitney Houston's I will always love you in the Bodyguard is certainly memorable, what else?

Edit: and I forgot probably the most obvious example of them all... almost ANY CCR tune in a Vietnam movie.",normal
"500 days of summer this was so much sadder than i expected 

i went into this film with no prior knowledge of it expecting a cute romcom as the caption suggested. To me this was such a well written film and it felt like i was only watching for 30 mins, the time flew by. It was such a gut wrenching watch, knowing from the way it was sequenced from the start that he would end up heartbroken while still smiling seeing what seemed to be a pure look of love from both characters. 

Although Summer made her intentions clear from the start it really seemed like they were a perfect fit for each other and that it would work out. This just made it harder when she moved on and Tom was left broken. I don‚Äôt think either were in the wrong and that things go like that sometimes. I would‚Äôve liked to see Tom progressing thurther but I suppose the ending is just showing how the Earth just keeps spinning and with time and love for life itself, not depending on another person for love, that things just fall into place. 

Watching this felt sad but afterwards it feels like such an insightful experience.

"A little confused about Sator's actions in Tenet So I watched Tenet with some friends. Maybe I missed something while they were talking.

So in this universe, what has happened has happened. The fact that the movie even took place means that Sator failed at destroying the world. Also Sator threatens to shoot Kat in the head, but the Protagonist saw them outside leaving (in reverse). So she obviously didn't get shot in the head.

Question is, does Sator just not fully understand how this time manipulation works? Or did I miss something in the movie. Sator should know he failed. I think the Protagonist even mentions something to that effect. Did I just miss how time time stuff works in Tenet?",normal

"The Office Space is one of the best movies I've watched. I wish Mike Judge would make more movies like that. Judge used to write and produce and direct movies and he sort of stopped doing that after Office Space. Which is surprising because that's such a fantastic movie. If you haven't seen it, it's a movie that makes fun of the mind-numbing work in cubicles in software companies that were all the rage in the 90s. But more generally, it just uses satire to show the boring nature of work, like the mindless paperwork,  stupid management, and forced participation in events (like Hawaiian shirt day or holding a birthday for an employee).

There are so many memorable characters and funny lines, the movie is just so quotable. And of course the ""beating the sh\*t ouf of the printer"" scene, as I call it, is legendary.

Wish there were more movies like that being made these days. We need to laugh at the absurdity of our lives in this economically challenging, politically ridiculous, and socially numb post-COVID world. This is all too much for people to put up with, it needs to be made fun of.",normal
"Longlegs is mid at best Just finished watching Longlegs and I was honestly pretty disappointed. First some things I did like was the cinematography and overall atmosphere, it kept me wondering what was gonna happen next and kept anxiety high. Other than that though I feel the story really weighted this movie down a lot. It all felt so random and only made just enough sense to keep going. I feel like the devil being in the dolls and causing the father's to kill is just not a great story. Also how did neither Lee or Carter noticed that his daughters birthday was the 13th? It seemed all so predictable and I just don't think it was really any good at all. Essentially after all the hype I thought I would be in for a wild movie but it just fell flat for me. Am I the only one that thinks this or was this movie just WAY overhyped?",normal
"Tremors and Jurassic Park are two great movies featuring big monsters. What are yours? I generally like big monster movies.

I was a big fan of the original Jurassic Park and have watched most of the sequels but nothing comes close to the original. Perhaps because I was quite young when I saw it or maybe it's the novelty factor, but I still get excited when I watch it. Particularly certain scenes involving the kids and the dinosaurs are exhilarating. And I'm a big fan of the cast (well, most, but that's a long story).

Another one was Tremors. I still go back and watch it, it's the right combo of horror, adventure, and humor.

During the interview, Sandler made a joke about what would happen if he didn‚Äôt win the Best Actor Academy Award. [He told Howard](https://www.businessinsider.com/adam-sandler-threatened-to-make-bad-movie-if-he-doesnt-win-oscar-uncut-gems-2019-12):

‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt get it, I‚Äôm going to f‚Äìking come back and do one again that is so bad on purpose just to make you all pay. That‚Äôs how I get them.‚Äù

In a bad news, bad news situation, Sandler wasn‚Äôt nominated, and he‚Äôs promised to make a terrible film (I‚Äôll still watch it a few times regardless). In an effort to assist the Sandman with his terrible film, I dug through all of his films and analyzed their posters to come up with the objectively worst Sandler picture that could be made. Here it is:

* *Jacked Up*
* Directed by Dennis Dugan
* Written By - Tim Herlihy
* PG-13
* Running Time: 135 minutes
* Released on Netflix
* Predicted Tomatometer score - 6%
* Predicted IMDb score - 3.75

Adam Sandler plays a personal trainer/shoe salesman named Jack Goodheart who is married to Janet Goodheart (Also, Sandler, using a very off-putting voice). They travel to an exclusive resort in Costa Rica to attend his 30th high school anniversary during the fourth of July weekend. During the event, Rob Schneider (playing a terrorist) and his team of henchmen, hijack the event and take everyone hostage, including State Senator Chuck Finley (Terry Crews) and presidential candidate Casey Fitzpatrick (Maya Rudolph). During the melee, Jack and Janet escape, and the two use their past military experience and buff physiques to save the day. This PG-13 action-comedy is entitled ‚Äú*Jacked Up*‚Äù and ends with a jet ski chase at the hotel‚Äôs lazy river pool that circles the hotel. The film is directed by Dennis Dugan, and co-stars Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Salma Hayek, Terry Crews, Steve Buscemi, Taylor Lautner, Luke Wilson, Peter Dinklage, Maya Rudolph, and Al Pacino.

This is how I came up with the storyline. I pulled together his best and worst films to find patterns that appear. Here are Sandler's lowest rated films on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. I drew a lot of inspiration from them. Also, I tried to make this as objective as possible.

* *The Ridiculous 6  (0% TM)* \- Action Comedy  - Action hero
* *Jack and Jill (3% - 3.3 IMDb)* \- Two Sandler's - Jet Ski scene - Married - Holiday
* *Grown Ups 2* (7%) - Reunited with old friends - Married
* *Bulletproof* (8%) - Action comedy
* *The Cobbler* (9%) - Shoe repairman
* *The Do-Over (10%)*  \- Action Comedy - Reunited with old friend - Married
* *Grown Ups (10%)* \- Reunited with old friends - Holiday - Married
* *Adam Sandler‚Äôs Eight Crazy Nights (12%)*\- Takes place during a holiday
* *Blended* (14%) - He‚Äôs a dad who travels to Africa
* *Going Overboard* (1.8 IMDb) - Lots of terrible boat action
* *The Week Of* (5.1 IMDb) families get together for a wedding
* *Sandy Wexler (5.1 IMDb)* \- Sandler pulls a unique voice (which isn‚Äôt statistically a good thing

**Here‚Äôs all I research I compiled to create** ***Jacked Up***

* A trademark of Sandler‚Äôs latest movies is that he likes to travel to beautiful locations to film (which is brilliant, and why not?). *The Do-Over, Just Go With It, Blended*, *Grown Ups 1 & 2* and *Murder Mystery* are examples of his penchant for travel. The problem is, the films have a lower Tomatometer average (21.2%) than the films where he didn‚Äôt travel to nice locations (37.4%). This is why he travels in *Jacked Up*.
* Sandler has several directors that he enjoys working with. Those Directors are Steven Brill, Dennis Dugan and Frank Coraci. Steven Brill (20%) has a lower Tomatometer average than Dennis Dugan (24%) and Frank Coraci (30%). However, Dugan is responsible for *Jack & Jill*, so I‚Äôm giving him the director‚Äôs chair. He did direct *Happy Gilmore*, so this could backfire on me. Frank Coraci directed *The Ridiculous 6*, but, [I love the baseball scene ](https://youtu.be/sI6LvdaozEk)and he also directed *The Waterboy* and *The Wedding Singer.*
* Aside from *You Don‚Äôt Mess With the Zohan* ([which is brilliant, and has a fun jet ski action scene](https://youtu.be/5OfAMHeIr7k)), His action comedies are lackluster. *Bulletproof* (8%) and *The Do-Over (9%)* didn‚Äôt win him many points. That‚Äôs why *Jacked Up* features an action-centered plot.
* His films featuring him as a married man have a 29% Tomatometer average. Movies featuring him as a single man have a 38% Average. Thus, the marriage to himself (think *Jack & Jill*) is included. It‚Äôs a double whammy
* I picked Tim Herlihy to write because he wrote *The Ridiculous Six, Grown Ups 2* and *Pixels (8% average)*. I do love his *Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer* and *The Waterboy* scripts though
* His PG-13 (29%) rated films have a lower Tomatometer average than his R (51%) and PG-rated (45%) films. For Netflix, M rating = R and TV-14 = PG-13
* I included a pool because in [*Airheads* he is a pool cleaner who thinks about swimming pools](https://youtu.be/YryTJKsn2i0). Also, *Grown Ups, The Do-Over, Jack and Jill* feature swimming pools. They have low scores.
* Movies that feature Sandler doing a voice have a lower Tomatometer score (24.8%) than his regular voiced roles (36%).
* None of his Fresh films feature a jet ski -[ *50 first Dates*](https://youtu.be/S__SZwFn0Rw) *(45%),* [*Jack & Jill*](https://youtu.be/leAGt-vpIf0) *(3%)* and *You Don‚Äôt Mess with the Zohan (37%)* are all Rotten
* In *The Ridiculous Six, Grown Ups, The Do-Over*, and *Bulletproof* he plays a totally capable man who isn‚Äôt an underdog like he is in *Billy Madison* and *Happy Gilmore*. So, he can‚Äôt be a doofus during the action scenes.
* Randomly enough, Rob Schneider shouldn‚Äôt adopt some kind of stereotyped character because his makeup-less roles have a lower Tomatometer average (27.6%) than his stereotyped roles (32%).
* His lowest rated movies on IMDb are *Going Overboard* (1.5), *Jack & Jill* (3.3), *The Ridiculous 6* (4.8), *Sandy Wexler* (5.1) and *The Week Of* (5.1) - These movies feature water exploits, gun fights, weird voices, two Sandlers, and large gatherings. These things are all in *Jacked Up*.
* \*Bulletproof (\*$25 million), *Little Nicky* ($39 million) and *Blended* ($46 million) are a few of his lowest grossing comedies. In these films, he uses a wild voice, goes on vacations and engages in action shenanigans. I left out movies like *Spanglish* and *Reign Over Me* because they aren‚Äôt traditional Sandler comedies. Also, *Billy Madison* and *Happy Gilmore* weren‚Äôt huge earners. However, they established him as a force of nature.
* His first or last name couldn‚Äôt begin with an ‚ÄúR‚Äù -  Howard Ratner (*Uncut Gems*), Henry Roth (*50 First Dates*), Robbie Hart (*The Wedding Singer*).

**WHAT DOES THE POSTER NEED TO LOOK LIKE?**

* He cannot be centered on the poster. His best films *Punch Drunk Love, Happy Gilmore, Funny People* and *Uncut Gems* feature him centered on the poster. *The Wedding Singer, Reign Over Me* and *The Meyerowitz Stories* don‚Äôt have him centered. However, the movie posters that have centered have a 48% Tomatometer Average. The Posters that have him on the left have a 30% Tomatometer average. I‚Äôm going with that.

https://preview.redd.it/actfhq081a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c8031c0894460b3d33ee218f96d31e80abcd3df

He' rarely centered in his ""worst"" films

https://preview.redd.it/7592qqi41a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff647a066806a5dfbf516fd83ebff761d79621dc

* There needs to be multiple people on the poster. When Sandler is alone on a poster, his movies have a 42% Tomatometer average. The movie posters with 4+ people have a 20% Tomatometer average. More is good.
* In this poster he needs to be holding something random. In *The Cobbler* poster he is holding a coffee cup (this is important) and the movie has an 8% Tomatometer score. In *The Wedding Singer* (microphone) and *Happy Gilmore* (golf club) and *The Waterboy* (bucket, helmet) he is holding items related to his character. He needs to be holding something weird (like a can of sponsored coca-cola). Also, the posters that feature him holding an item (31%) have a lower Tomatometer score than the posters featuring him not holding anything (42%).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l6mzirud1a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8ccf8ee14641d421c38e2c0775f00299e517d83

* It‚Äôs best if his entire body is on the poster. The movie posters featuring a full-bodied Adam Sandler have a lower Tomatometer average (31%) than his partial body posters (43%).
* Ideally, the title would be in the center, because *Jack & Jill* and *The Ridiculous Six* have somewhat centered titles.

**Poster**

* Title centered
* Sandler(s) on left side - Full body
* At least six other characters on the poster

There you have it! I can't wait to watch *Jacked Up*.

"a cheer for 'Logan' and 'John Wick 2' for NOT being in 3D! I've recently seen both these films. and they are both not in 3D which made the quality of watching the movie for me personally SOOO much better. I cant think of what would have been enhanced if watched in 3D. those movies look beautiful and perfect in 2D.
those are two huge action movies and they are both being praised. Also they will both make alot of Money ( i hope so ) So my hope is, this starts a trend.

EDIT: since a lot of people are telling me ""just watch it in 2D then, no one is forcing you"" I live in germany and the theatre that I go to ( which i own a membercard to ) has all the showings in 3D until 2-3 weeks after the movie came out. maybe it will have a 2D showing once per day, but that will be like at noon on a monday or something.

"[OPINION] Rich filmmakers who probably haven't paid money to go see a film in a regular modern cinema in years/decades need to stop running their mouths about ""the sanctity of the movie theater experience"" and admonishing home viewing, which is often a far purer film experience these days. Rant forthcoming...  


No shortage of recent examples, the most prominent obviously being Spielberg's alleged attempts to get made-for-streaming films banned from the Oscars.  


To be clear right off the bat - **I love the cinema experience**. Or rather, the *ideal* cinema experience. But that's become *so rare* as to be a complete gamble these days, and very often ends up being the *shitty* cinema experience. Whereas I can watch a movie at home and *know* it's not going to get diminished or outright ruined by any number of constant social or technical problems.  


Do any of the free premieres and private screenings Spielberg attends include people browsing Instagram on their blinding white phones every 20 minutes, or unchecked kids talking or crying? Has he dealt with people constantly getting up and walking through your FOV to go to the bathroom or get snacks at *inexplicable* times during a film, breaking your immersion? Or not being able to afford to see more than one film every month or two due to increasingly ridiculous costs?  


There's also the technical issues which have become outright depressing now. 3D looks *terrible* compared to Blu-Ray - dark, blurry, thoroughly diluting of anything the cinematographer was trying to accomplish - but is often the only option available to see something depending on where you live. There are films I don't even feel like I've *seen* until watching them properly at home, because the 3D muddled things so badly. Sound has also become an issue - contrary to the idea that a home audio setup can never compete with the cinema, I've found that theater sound is absolutely pathetic these days compared to watching Netflix with a good pair of headphones, and am often straining to hear dialogue and am utterly unmoved by the weak music. The only consistent exception there is IMAX and UltraAVX which is gloriously loud, but that can be a problem too if it's, for example, a Nolan film, who for all his big talk about the theater experience is one of of the worst offenders for ruining it with his infamously shrill mixing that leaves viewers covering their ears, only able to enjoy his work in a controlled environment months later at home.  


The ""movie theater experience"" is great when it's the good version - nobody on their phones, nobody misbehaving, perfect picture and audio, within your budget, a whole audience communally having a great time being immersed in a film together. In practice however, this perfect storm of awesome happens maybe one in five times by my reckoning these days, and more often than not it's way more immersive, impressive and pure to watch a film on an HD screen with headphones, no distractions and privacy at home. So the Hollywood elite needs a reality check about the evils of watching their films on the small screen - it's often the only way to really appreciate them now.",normal

"If Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence in Passengers had switched roles with Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, both movies would've been significantly better. In Valerian you could have Chris Pratt as the handsome and cocky Special Operative with his sexy, ass-kicking co-pilot in Lawrence.  They both already have a ton of charisma and chemistry and are much better suited to the athletic and action heavy roles of Valerian and Laureline and would do a far better job delivering on the action and cheesy one-liners with Pratt hitting on Lawrence and her playing hard to get.   It would be far more entertaining to see them flying around the universe than what we got in DeHaan pretending to be a character he isn't suited for and having zero chemistry with Laureline.   
  
On the other hand, you could have DeHaan in Passengers as the creepy loner and sole awakened passenger.  Slinking around the ship by himself, slowly succumbing to the isolation and going insane until he awakens Delevingne and awkwardly convinces her to fall in love with him.    
  
I think this works better because it always bugged me in Passengers that Pratt and Lawrence just so happen to be the most attractive people and have this amazingly natural on-screen chemistry right off the bat?  It would be far more interesting to have DeHaan chasing after a hesitant Delevingne and I think having him in that role being creepy and doing generally morally questionable things is much more compelling.     
  
I also think in this case, Passengers could fully commit to being more of a sci-fi horror/thriller that it wanted to be (okay, that **I** wanted it to be).  Instead of having him make the cliche third act sacrifice and then they fall in love, set up something much darker:     
  
Keep it mostly the same through the first two acts.  Jim (DeHaan) wakes up, alone and wanders around the ship for a year, with no one to talk to but the robot bartender and slowly goes insane.  Delevigne is woken up and is quietly and reluctantly falling in love with the only other person on board the ship.  She eventually realizes that her waking up wasn't an accident and that she is being gaslighted.  Naturally, she is horrified and runs off to another section of the ship and in a third act twist, discovers that she was actually not the first person DeHaan had tried this on.  That he had actually been awake much longer than he initially told her and failed several times before with other women whom he had to kill and seal off in another section of the ship.  You could even make it so the robot bartender is encouraging Jim's psychosis.  ",normal

"Opinion: I think it was foolish of Disney to remake so many of their popular movies within the span of a year: Dumbo, Aladdin, Lion King, Mulan. If they had spaced them out to maybe 1 or 2 a year, they might each be received better; but now people are getting weary, and Disney's greed is showing. I know their executives are under pressure to perform, but that's the problem when capitalism overrides common sense in entertainment; they want to make the most money for the quarterly/yearly record-books and don't always consider the long-term.  IMO each of the films in the Disney Renaissance years could have pulled them a lot of money if they had released them over the course of a few years.  Those are some of their most popular properties.  But with them coming out so soon, one after the other, the public probably doesn't respect them as much nor would they be as anticipated as they could be.   At least Marvel knows how to play the 'peaks and valleys'/ cyclical nature of public interest, and so they wisely space out many of their films.  But if Disney forces its supply on movie goers, they might just find people balking at its oversaturation of the market and so may rebel in their entertainment choices some way, reflecting in lower revenue for Disney.  As it's said in Spiderman, ""with great power comes great responsibility;"" the Mouse is slowly dominating the entertainment sphere but if it can't let people step back and breathe, or delivers cookie-cutter films (which is a downside of tapping into franchise-building or nostalgia trends), the cheese pile it hoards will start to smell and it may not be able to easily escape it.",normal

"Please Netflix, I beg of you; let the credits roll. I've just finished Gladiator. The music swells as the camera pans above the colosseum. The emotions that come from a triumphant yet bittersweet ending begin to settle. And as the screen fades to black, and you feel the catharsis that comes from watching an epic film take hold....

A bright title card for Suits comes up.

Who has ever finished a film and on finishing it clicks the recommended film straight away?  And yet the ads come up, every single time. It completely ruins the moment. And yes, you can click the box to continue watching the credits- but why should we even have to do that? Why is it so hard for Netflix to not promote their material for five minutes after a film ends?

In a life bombarded by advertisements do we have to be shown another one the second a film finishes? Is there no respite? 

From what I've seen online there isn't a way to disable this specific feature (though I would really love to be proven wrong on this one).

Anyway, rant over.",normal

"Okay Hollywood, ""Deadpool"" and ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" are both smash hits at the box office. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is even nominated for best picture. So, can we PLEASE go back to having R rated blockbusters? I think /r/movies can be a bit too obsessed with things being rated R but overall, I still agree with the sentiment. Terminator 2 could not be made today and I think that's very sad because many people consider it one of the best movies of all time. 

The common counter-argument to this is something along the lines of ""swearing, blood, and nudity aren't what makes a movie good"". And that would be correct, something being rated R does not inherently make it good or better. But what it DOES add is realism. REAL people swear. Real people bleed. Real people have nipples. R ratings are better for making things feel realistic and grounded. 

Also, and I think this is an even important point, PG-13 often makes the audience feel a bit too comfortable. Sometimes art should be boundary pushing or disturbing. Some movies need to be graphic in order to really leave a lasting mark. I think this is the main problem with audiences and movies today, a lot of it is too safe and comfortable. I rarely feel any great sense of emotion. Do you think the T-1000 would have been as iconic of a movie villain if we hadn't seen him stab people through the head with his finger? Probably not. In Robocop, would Murphy's near-death experience have felt as intense had it cut away and not shown him getting filled with lead? Definitely not. Sometimes you NEED that.

I'm not saying everything has to be R. James Bond doesn't have to be R because since day one his movies were meant to be family entertainment and were always PG. Same with Jurassic Park. But the problem is that PG-13 has been used for movies that WEREN'T supposed to be like this. Terminator was never a family movie. Neither was Robocop. They were always dark, intense sci-fi that people loved because it was hardcore and badass. And look what happened to their PG-13 reboots, they were neither hardcore nor badass. 

The most common justification for things not being R is ""they make less money"" but I think this has become a self fulfilling prophecy. Studios assume they'll make less money, so they make less R rated movies, so they're less likely to make money, so then studios make less, and on and on. 

But adjusted for inflation, [Terminator 2 made almost a BILLION dollars.](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=520.000%2C000&year1=1991&year2=2015) (the calculator only goes up to 10,000,000 so I had to knock off some zeroes).  

[The Matrix Reloaded made even more.](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=742.1&year1=2003&year2=2015) 

If it's part of a franchise we like, people will probably see it anyway. It might lose a slight margin but clearly it's possible to still become a huge hit and have an R rating. 

Hell, even if it's something we DON'T know about, it can still make money. Nobody cared about the comic that Kingsman was based on but it made a lot of cash anyway. Just imagine if it had actually been part of a previously established franchise, it could have even made more of a killing. In fact, I bet the next one does even better. 

And Deadpool, who does have a fanbase, is in no way a mainstream hero and was a big gamble. But it's crushing records right now and grossed almost THREE TIMES its meager budget in just a few days. And the only reason it got made to begin with is because of Ryan Reynolds pushing for it and fans demanding it. How many more of these movies could have been made in the past but weren't because of studios not taking risks? Well, THIS risk payed off extremely well. I know Ryan wasn't the only one to make it happen, and I really appreciate whomever made the film a reality, not because it's the best movie ever (it is good though), but because it could represent Hollywood funding more of these kinds of movies. 

Sorry for the rant, but I really hope these movies are indicative of Hollywood returning to form and taking more risks again. This may be linked to /r/moviescirclejerk, but I don't care, I think it needed to be said. 

EDIT: Holy shit, did you people read anything other than the title? I addressed the majority of the points being made here. ",normal

"Disney pricing their new releases at $30 on top of regular Disney+ subscription sets a bad precedence for future of streaming With release of Mulan at $30 on Disney+ even if you had a subscription doesn't really bode well for us consumers in future where we have to shell out extra money even after paying for 3-4 subscriptions already on average (Netflix, Disney+, Prime, HBO). Some of the companies in India have already started following Disney's lead and putting new movies out of subscription for $35 to $40 rent. This was really scummy from Disney when they increased the subscription price by 50% here when lockdown started. I wouldn't mind paying a little bit extra as a part of annual subscription to offset for new movies but selling them out of subscription is bad for consumers and with a big company like Disney leading the charge,  most of the local smaller companies will follow.

"I saw 192 movies in theaters in 2019. Here is my full ranking. This year I went to see 192 different movies in theaters, plus one rewatch. That's up from 162 in 2018, 140 in 2017, 9 in 2016, and 5 in 2015. I usually go 3 or 4 times per week, mostly on weekends. I keep track of dates/theaters/movies/ratings for fun and save all of the stubs.

My ratings are what I give the movie right after seeing it, with no real 'checklist' or anything, mostly just initial thought/enjoyment/opinion. It's not meant to be taken super seriously, I'm not a professional reviewer.

This is my full ranking for the year, from favorite to least-favorite, with a few small reviews/thoughts thrown in:

--------------------------------------------------------

**Monos - 10/10** - *Hands-down my favorite movie of the year and honestly high on my all-time list. It's Apocalypse Now meets Lord of the Flies, with some Beasts of No Nation thrown in. It builds a unique, lived-in world that's believable and brutal. Beautifully-filmed, some of the best shots of the year (the ending shot gets seared in your mind). Modern and grounded look at a militia/cartel fighting against an unnamed enemy in a Colombian jungle. It almost feels post-apocalyptic instead of 'cartel vs government', which I really loved. You get to imagine your own backstory as the story unfolds. Unforgiving and gut-wrenching, but hopeful too. Got a lot out of its cast. Can't recommend this movie enough. Really disappointed this didn't make the Best Foreign Language Film shortlist. ""Masterpiece"" gets thrown around a lot, but in my mind this is the only one this year.*

**Marriage Story - 10/10**

**The Farewell - 10/10**

**Journey to a Mother's Room - 9/10** - *Biggest surprise of the year, came out of nowhere. Deeply-personal story between a mother & daughter. It's very basic on the surface, and there's not much story (you start at Point A, and end at Point A), but it's the most emotional movie of the year. If you don't cry at least 3 times during this, you're probably not human. It's all about the unbreakable connection you have to your parent(s), from the day you're born until the day you die. It only takes place over the course of a few months, but feels like lifetimes. Beautiful little movie about separation, loss, and human connection.*

**Waves - 9/10** - *I could write 20 pages on how much I loved this movie. To keep it short, it's got a perfect soundtrack, perfect setting, awards-worthy performances (from Kelvin Harrison Jr., Sterling K. Brown, and Taylor Russell). Visceral story that grips you from the first minute and doesn't let go until the closing shot. Unique use of colors and aspect-ratio. It takes a huge risk structurally that pays off. It's also the only movie I went to see twice this year. Really worth it too, picked up on a lot of stuff on the second viewing. Would've went a third time if theaters kept it playing longer. Every tiny decision/action has a huge impact. Just watch this.*

**Last Black Man In San Francisco - 9/10**

**Birds of Passage - 9/10**

**Apollo 11 - 9/10** - *The best documentary of the year. Probably the best editing (and use of sound) I've ever seen/heard in a documentary. It's unique because they don't use interviews like most documentaries do, it's real sound the whole through. Impressive use of archival footage/audio.*

**Uncut Gems - 9/10** - *This movie wasn't on the Best Original Score shortlist for the 2020 Oscars. This aggression will not stand.*

**The Mustang - 9/10**

**Wild Rose - 9/10** - *If this doesn't win the Oscar for Best Original Song ('Glasgow'), I've lost all faith in the Academy. The ending concert scene had me crying like a baby. Jessie Buckley is gonna be big. Best music-drama since A Star Is Born.*

**Transit  - 9/10**

**Ad Astra - 9/10** - *Top-notch acting, great atmosphere, world-building, existentialism, beautiful VFX, engaging score. Best opening scene of the year. Thoughtful commentary on modern society all wrapped in a Heart of Darkness blanket. If you're into space/exploration movies, then I recommend this. Surprised at the backlash this movie has gotten on /r/movies.*

**The Report  - 9/10** - *This was a really good year for legal-thrillers and The Report was the cream of the crop. Tight, Sorkin-like script with top performances from Adam Driver & Annette Bening. Could change a lot of minds about the war on terror and use of torture.*

**Parasite - 9/10**

**Once Upon A Time In Hollywood - 9/10**

**Midnight Traveler - 9/10** - *If you feel like life is unfair and the odds are stacked against you, watch this movie. It puts everything in a different perspective. Every problem you have is going to seem minuscule compared to what this family went through. It's eye-opening and should fill you with anger.*

**Luce - 9/10** - *It's Kelvin Harrison Jr's world and we're just living in it.*

**The Irishman - 8/10**

**Mickey and the Bear - 8/10** - *Camila Morrone puts in the best breakout performance of the year. PTSD, drug-addiction, alcoholism, rural Montana, toxic relationships, James Badge Dale, following your dreams. What's not to love?*

**The Art of Self Defense - 8/10** - *The best dark-comedy of the year. So many great one liners. It's like Yorgos Lanthimos directing Death of Stalin, set in a karate studio. Surprisingly violent and depressing, but in all the right ways. Jesse Eisenberg's best movie since.....The Social Network?*

**Peanut Butter Falcon - 8/10** - *""Am I going to die?"" ""We all do, it's only a 
matter of time, now stop being a little bitch."" - Favorite line of the year, really stuck with me.*

**Everybody Knows - 8/10**

**Mary Magdalene - 8/10**

**Knives Out - 8/10** - *Well-crafted whoddunit with an ensemble cast. Just a genuinely fun time at the movies. Ana de Armas with well-deserved leading role for once. A few of the characters are a tad bit unrealistic (and basically caricatures), but the movie doesn't take itself seriously enough for that to be a problem. Daniel Craig hamming it up with a Southern accent was fun. Old school film with a modern twist.*

**The Lighthouse - 8/10** 

**The Dead Don't Die - 8/10** - *This movie really isn't for everyone, but I loved the dry humor and purposefully-bad chemistry/dialogue. The line delivery was off-putting but hilarious. Everything is extremely on-the-nose and it works. I could watch 10 hours of Tom Waits talking to himself.*

**Us - 8/10**

**Villains - 8/10**

**Ford v Ferrari  - 8/10** 

**Midsommar - 8/10**

**Jojo Rabbit  - 8/10** 

**Official Secrets - 8/10** - *Keira Knightley with one of the most underrated performances of the year. Another really good legal/political-thriller that exposes the dark side of government bureaucracy.*

**Pain & Glory - 8/10** 

**John Wick 3: Parabellum - 8/10**

**Queen & Slim - 8/10**

**Amazing Grace - 8/10** - *Great concert-documentary. Some of Aretha Franklin's performances in this should give you insane chills. I actually had this one rated higher right after watching it, but then looked up some of the people shown on screen and it turns out some were real pieces of shit, while preaching to people like hypocrits. Felt gross and took a lot of the magic out. One of my few revised scores this year.*

**A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood - 8/10**

**Joker - 8/10**

**Non-Fiction - 8/10** - *It's very French (talky and sexual) and the writing seems impressed with itself,  but it's a good adult-drama that surprised me. I'm a big fan of Olivier Assayas and this is some of his best work.*

**Rocketman - 8/10**

**Stan & Ollie - 8/10**

**Hustlers - 8/10**

**Avengers Endgame - 8/10**

**Doctor Sleep - 8/10** - *It gets bloated and probably needed to be 20-30 minutes shorter (there's a shit ton of side-characters), but it was a worthwhile sequel to The Shining. Didn't feel like a cash grab and carries its own weight.*

**Booksmart - 8/10** 

**Little Monsters  - 8/10** - *I'd recommend watching this based just on Josh Gad's character. So over-the-top and hilarious. When he starts chugging hand sanitizer might be the most I laughed in a theater this year. Also Lupita Nyong'o playing & singing on the ukulele to a bunch of kids is exactly what I needed in my life. Cute zombie-comedy with a ton of heart.*

**Spider-Man: Far From Home - 8/10**

**A Hidden Life - 8/10** - *If there's a song from this year (or this decade even) that I'd want played at my funeral, it's James Newton Howard's theme from this movie. It's so beautiful and perfectly captures the feel of the movie. That song broke me down every time it played. I can't imagine this movie without it, it's that good. It's a shame this movie is getting ignored this awards season.*

**Never Look Away - 8/10**

**Toy Story 4 - 8/10**

**Pavarotti - 8/10**

**The Biggest Little Farm - 8/10**-  *If you're really into the inner-workings of a Californian farm, then this is the documentary for you.*

**Abominable - 8/10**  

**The Current War - 7/10** 

**Artic  - 7/10** - *Well made, solidly-acted. I loved the small details about survival that this movie brings up, makes it very grounded and realistic. I'm kinda bored of survival movies in general so this didn't blow my mind or anything.*

**Bombshell - 7/10**

**Honey Boy - 7/10** - *Pretty big letdown because I had really high expectations for this one. Lacked the emotional punch I hoped for. Didn't land for me at all, kind of like Boy Erased last year. I appreciate how honest and revealing it was, took a lot of guts for Shia LaBeouf to put this out there but it's forgettable. Lucas Hedges' Shia impression was reallllly on point though, that was worth the price of admission right there. Mid90s last year was a 10/10 for me and I expected the same for this. It was good, not great.*

**American Woman - 7/10** - *Sienna Miller's performance in this is awards-worthy. The accent she does is perfect and it might be the most underrated role of the year. The movie gets way too tearjerky at the end though. It's basically 2 hours of bad shit happening to a good person, which gets a bit overwhelming.*

**The Beach Bum - 7/10**

**Captain Marvel - 7/10**

**Spies In Disguise - 7/10** - *Looked pretty generic based on the trailer, but was actually pretty funny.*

**Cold Pursuit - 7/10**

**Tolkien - 7/10** - *Not much happens but it felt really comfortable. Solid performances all around and they handled the WW1 scenes better than I thought they would. Expected to be bored out of my mind based on the reviews and trailer but it flowed well. As far as ""Nicholas Hoult Biopics of Famous Writers"" go, it's miles ahead of Rebel in the Rye 2 years ago.*

**Jumanji: The Next Level - 7/10**

**Sauvage/Wild - 7/10**

**Detective Pikachu - 7/10**

**Maiden - 7/10**

**Dark Waters - 7/10** - . *Good performances and an okay script, even though it beats you over the head sometimes. Total waste of Anne Hathaway. She's way too good of an actress for a boring, generic, 'supporting wife' role with just a few lines. Not even sure why she was in this. Overall, a solid legal-thriller, which is a genre I really enjoy and I've been missing since its late-90s heyday. Pretty crazy story too, scummy and evil corporate greed is always interesting to explore on film (like The Insider). Should've been 20 minutes shorter and less on-the-nose*

**Adopt A Highway - 7/10**

**The Wedding Guest - 7/10**

**The Hummingbird Project - 7/10**

**Motherless Brooklyn - 7/10**

**The Lion King - 7/10**

**Last Christmas - 7/10** - *It's really easy to bash this movie, a lot of the humor falls flat and the twist is ridiculous, but I couldn't help walking out with a smile. I love how committed Emilia Clarke was to the character, and her interactions with her boss and family were legitimately heart-warming at times. Also did I mention how ridiculous that twist is?*

**Richard Jewell  - 7/10** - *This was decent. Even though it's clearly Clint Eastwood's personal crusade (and thinly-veiled propaganda piece in some regards) against the FBI & the Spooky Media‚Ñ¢, it still told the story effectively/semi-believably. Some of the characters (Hamm/Wilde obviously) were pretty ridiculous caricatures though, was hard to take anything they said seriously, I mean come on. You just roll your eyes at most of what they say. Some of the situations and encounters are too-conveniently set-up but that's easy to overlook. It had very solid performances (Hauser was great, especially when he finally let's his emotion show, in that scene where he kicks the table). Much better than The Mule, and 20x better than 15:17 To Paris.*

**Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker - 7/10**

**21 Bridges - 7/10**

**Before You Know It - 7/10**

**Hobbs & Shaw - 7/10** - *This is peak ""Stupid Summer Popcorn Movie"" and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's The Meg of 2019*.

**Fighting With My Family - 7/10**

**Pet Sematary  - 7/10**

**Downton Abbey - 7/10** - *Never saw a single episode of the show before watching the movie, but it still felt familiar/safe to jump right in.*

**Yesterday - 7/10**

**Greta  - 7/10** - *It's a cheesy, predictable, non-scary horror film but I liked it. Sometimes you just need Isabelle Hupert to play a psychopathic serial killer. Felt very old-school, a movie straight out of the 1980s.*

**Judy - 7/10** - *It's the definition of Oscar bait and is emotionally manipulative, especially towards the end, but it does a great job at humanizing a Hollywood legend.*

**Frozen 2  - 7/10**

**Aladdin - 7/10**

**The Souvenir - 7/10**

**Zombieland 2: Double Tap - 7/10** - *Nowhere near as memorable/iconic as the first one, but it still got a bunch of laughs from me (especially the Thomas Middleditch/Luke Wilson scene). Above-average for a comedy-sequel, but I could see this one not aging well*.

**The Two Popes - 6/10** - *Two solid performances but underwhelming overall, too many cheap-looking flashback scenes, not enough Pryce/Hopkins. Reminded me of Can You Ever Forgive Me? last year, depending on the 2 leads to carry a weak movie/premise on their back, to disappointing results. Highly-overrated movie.*

**Ready Or Not - 6/10**

**Anna - 6/10** - *It's basically Red Sparrow but slightly worse*.

**Saint Frances  - 6/10**

**Hotel Mumbai - 6/10** 

**Shazam! - 6/10** - *Low-stakes, formulaic, superhero movie clearly made with strict budget limitations. It hits all the notes you'd expect a movie like this to hit. It was decent.*

**Alita: Battle Angel - 6/10**

**Loro - 6/10** - *One of the more disappointing movies of the year. On paper it sounds amazing, a sprawling biopic of an infamous/corrupt Italian politician/mogul by Paolo Sorrentino who's not that far removed from a masterpiece? Sign me the fuck up. But nah, this was a shallow, surface-level (like my reviews), pointless dull knife of a biopic. Too much shoehorned religious imagery too. Tone is all over the place. It can't decide whether it's serious or funny and gets lost in-between. It looked nice at least. It also wins this year's ""Most Nudity"" award, easily beating the rest of the field.*

**Teen Spirit - 6/10**

**The Upside - 6/10**

**Gloria Bell - 6/10** - *Great performance from Julianne Moore but this just felt like ""Middle-Aged Crisis: The Movie"". Just couldn't connect to it. I imagine the original is a lot better.*

**On The Basis Of Sex - 6/10**

**Stockholm - 6/10**

**Give Me Liberty  - 6/10**  - *This is an example of a movie that has its heart in the right place but bites off a lot more than it can chew. There's a beautiful, emotional story in here somewhere, but it's too muddled with ineffective editing tricks and too many side-stories. It's sweet in some ways and the true-life characters bring a lot of charm, but it didn't do that much for me. A lot of 'year-end' lists have this as one of the most overlooked movies of the year, but I don't see it. Rough editing, bad soundtrack.*

**Child's Play - 6/10**

**Good Boys - 6/10** - *Just watch Booksmart instead*.

**Styx - 6/10**

**Woman at War - 6/10**

**The Lego Movie 2 -  6/10**

**Missing Link - 6/10**

**Long Shot - 6/10** - *The chemistry between Charlize Theron & Seth Rogen was great but the jokes couldn't really match it. It's a unique mix of politics & humor, but fell short of being an actual crowd-pleaser.*

**Echo in the Canyon - 6/10**

**Cyrano, My Love - 6/10**

**Dora the Explorer - 6/10**

**Brittany Runs A Marathon - 6/10**

**IT: Chapter 2 - 6/10** - *Way too long. Felt like a never-ending series of fetch-quests. Good CGI & acting though.*

**Mister America - 6/10**

**Crawl - 6/10**

**Trial By Fire - 6/10** - *Great performances by Laura Dern & Jack O'Connell get overshadowed by an overly-preacy script. It doesn't let the audience make up its own mind.*

**The Third Wife - 6/10**

**Godzilla: King of Monsters - 5/10** - *This needed less humans, more monsters.*

**Glass - 5/10**

**Escape Room - 5/10**

**Terminator: Dark Fate - 5/10**

**Dumbo - 5/10** 

**All Is True - 5/10**

**Brightburn  - 5/10**

**The White Crow - 5/10** - *One of those biopics where the movie doesn't do justice to the story. Reading the Wikipedia page on this guy's life, you'd except an Oscar contender. Instead it was just okay. Watch Cold War instead. It's basically this movie but better.*

**High Life - 5/10** - *Unpleasant.*

**Where'd You Go Bernadette? - 5/10**

**Scary Stories to Tell Dark - 5/10**

**Her Smell - 5/10** - *This movie made me physically nauseous. The tight, claustrophobic, haze-filled shots in the first 2 acts really threw me off. It's temporarily redeemed by a reallllllly good third act and a solid performance from Elisabeth Moss. But then deflated by a terrible final scene.*

**By the Grace of God - 5/10** - *Based on the critical acclaim, director, and subject matter, I walked in expected to be blown away. Basically expected Spotlight, but this movie completely derails at the halfway point. Hard to sit through*.

**Blinded by the Light - 5/10**

**The Best of Enemies - 5/10**

**The Aeronauts - 5/10** - *This is mis-marketed as an intense survival story but it's really just a boring biopic with too many flashbacks.*

**Fall of the American Empire - 5/10**

**Family - 5/10**

**The Goldfinch - 5/10** - *It turns out an unfilmable novel really is unfilmbable, who would've thought? Shoutout to Jeffrey Wright & Finn Wolfhard for actually trying.*

**Angel Has Fallen - 5/10**

**Gemini Man - 5/10** 

**Late Night  - 5/10**

**Black and Blue  - 5/10** 

**Diane - 5/10** - *This was just depression-porn. Sometimes it works (Mungiu/Zvyagintsev), sometimes it doesn't (this movie). It's such a bummer. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone but Mary Kay Place's performance makes it watchable and engaging sometimes.*

**Destroyer - 5/10**

**How To Train Your Dragon 3 - 5/10**

**Rafiki - 5/10** - *I feel bad for this score because I get that this is a really important/significant movie for African Cinema, but I just couldn't get past the terrible acting, bad (like baaaaaad) dialogue, and lackluster story. Again, pretty big achievement that this got made and reached a global audience, but yeah, in a vacuum, it's undoubtedly a bad movie. Felt like an amateur movie on a shoestring budget.*

**Captive State - 4/10**

**Wild Nights With Emily - 4/10** - *This movie is what happens when someone asks the question ""hey, what if we turned Emily Dickinson's life into an SNL skit?"". I get what they were going for, and Molly Shannon is great, but this was extremely unfunny and probably the longest 84-minute movie I've ever seen.*

**Dark Pheonix - 4/10**

**The Addams Family - 4/10**

**Midway  - 4/10**

**To Dust - 4/10**

**Rojo - 4/10** - *The only memorable thing about this movie is that there was a power outage about 90 minutes in so they comped my ticket and gave me a free drink. So that was cool, I guess.*

**The Kid Who Would Be King - 4/10**

**MIB: International - 4/10**

**The Kid - 4/10** - *There's a 98% chance that this movie is some kind of tax write-off or money laundering scheme. It somehow got 2 big names (Pratt & Hawke), co-starring the son of the producer in his first movie ever. Directed by Vincent D'Onofrio for some reason (???). Was dumped by Lionsgate in a few hundred theaters with 0 marketing/promotion, and flopped hard. It's dated, boring, and unoriginal. Cheesy dialogue. Literally a story that's been told a million times before, usually in much better ways. No reason for this to exist. Chris Pratt has the worst fake-movie-beard of all time in this, that's kinda worth checking out.*

**Ramen Shop - 4/10**

**The Good Liar - 4/10**- *The most convoluted, needlessly-complicated plot of the year. Helen Mirren & Ian McKellen both phone it in (I don't blame them, they were given trash to work with). I hate when movies try to crowbar ""WW2 flashbacks"" into their movies when it's not needed.*

**Climax - 4/10**

**Harriet - 4/10** 

**Lucy in the Sky - 4/10** - *Once or twice a year, a movie comes along that has such a frustrating/stupid/anti-climactic ending it makes me actually angry. This is that movie. Natalie Portman had another movie like that last year (Vox Lux). Hey Noah Hawley, what the fuck?*

**Freaks - 4/10** - *This movie would fit well in the ""Good Idea But Bad Execution"" subreddit.*

**Tel Aviv On Fire - 4/10**

**Ma - 4/10**

**Frankie  -  3/10**

**Stuber - 3/10**

**Serenity - 3/10** - *In a year full of batshit-crazy twists (looking at you, Last Christmas), this easily had the batshit-iest twist. It's something you actually have to experience yourself, and be fully-immersed in it, to appreciate how mind-numblingly crazy it is. How they got A-list talent for this script is a total mystery, but it probably involves of a lot of favors and cocaine. It's almost ""so bad its good"". Almost. I can't wait for the sequel, Free Guy, next year.*

**Maleficent 2: Mistress of Evil - 3/10** - *More genocide than I expected for a live-action Disney fairy tale movie.*

**Donnybrook - 3/10**

**The Photograph - 3/10** - *Zzzzzzzzzz...*

**Charlie's Angels - 3/10**

**Hellboy - 3/10** - *This movie is like that annoying kid in middle school that tries way to hard to be edgy. It's gory and vulgar just for the sake of being gory & vulgar. It reminded me of the Predator reboot last year, had the same kind of dated/forced humor that seems to have no real target audience (except for the aforementioned middle school edgy kid I guess). Bad CGI and a boring villain. iirc it also had a lame sequel-bait ending which I hate.*

**Happy Death Day 2U** - 3/10 - 

**The Sun Is Also A Star** - 3/10 - *It's filmed like a generic music video and has the emotional depth of a puddle.*

**Don't Let Go** - 3/10

**The Invisibles** - 3/10

**Playing with Fire  - 3/10** - *This was just like Mark Wahlberg's Instant Family last year, except that it was worse in every imaginable way. No lie, the end-credits bloopers were by far better than anything else in the movie. It was the only time I even chuckled or felt any type of emotion.*

**Cats - 2/10** - *There's not much more I could say that already hasn't been said. Yes, it was bad. No, it wasn't the worst movie in history. For me, it was just so boring. Forgettable songs (except Beautiful Ghosts), no story/plot, nonsensical ending. Just wanted it to end. Jennifer Hudson just floating into space for no reason, Judi Dench giving me unwarranted lessons about raising cats, Ian McKellen slurping milk from a bowl, Extremely-Hairy-And-Naked-Idris-Elba, Cockroach Genocide, etc. These things all happened and we can't change them, and for us to grow as a society, we need to just move on and learn from our mistakes.*

**Rambo: Last Blood - 2/10**

**The Sound of Silence - 2/10** - *More like The Sound of Boredom, amirite? No but seriously, that's all I got. This movie was the closest I got to falling asleep in my seat this year.*

**Synonyms - 2/10**

**Black Christmas - 2/10** - *Extremely cheesy dialogue, cop-out violence, boring/predictable jump scares, low production value (bad even for a low-end Blumhouse movie), some of the worst one-liners you've ever heard, unrealistic/2D characters. Shitty ending. Wayyyyy too heavy-handed with the message. About as subtle as a flying brick to the forehead. Amateur acting, cutaway for every death, etc etc.*

**After the Wedding - 2/10** - *Overacted, muddled garbage.*

**47 Meters Down Uncaged - 1/10**

**Shaft - 1/10** - *Crude, unfunny, soulless, grating, pointless. There's a million adjectives I could use to describe this reboot, and none of them are positive. This is one I'm surprised I didn't just walk out of. Probably didn't have anything better do do that day.*

**Jexi - 1/10** - *This year's worst movie. It's just the kind of movie that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, like you need to watch something else to get the stink of this one out of your mind. It was just so mean-spirited, from start to finish. Not a single joke landed, you just hated all of the characters. There are no redeeming factors. On the technical side, it was very basic, looked like a cheap music video. No memorable scenes, no good lines of dialogue, no originality in any way. None of the ""cheerful""/""pick-me-up"" moments earn any kind of emotional reaction. If you had a freshman high-school film student remake Her as a shitty comedy, this would be it. The fact that I paid money to see this is something I will never live down.*

**Other:**

* The longest stretch I went without going to the movies was from July 21st thru August 20th, without a single trip to the movies. Partially due to an out-of-country trip and personal stuff. During this time I ""missed out"" on **The Kitchen**, **The Nightingale**, **Brian Banks**, and **Honeyland**. Mostly caught up to the rest.
* The most theater visits in a one-week span was November 1st thru November 8th, with 8 movies that week.
* The most in one day was 3 movies in theaters on March 15th, 2019 (**Styx**, **To Dust**, and **Captive State**).
* There were 26 double-headers this year (two movies in theaters during the same day, usually back-to-back).

"Watch John Wick 1 & 2. Then watch Constantine. Constantine feels like a sequel in a series where our protagonist, John, develops the ability to fight Hell itself. The continuity is made possible because everyone refers to the character as ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù and treats him with a reserved respect. This a very cool continuity exercise, one that I accidentally stumbled upon in a search to watch movies with detached heroes doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing out of obligation. Our protagonist, John, develops a hate for the society that created his life in John Wick 1 &amp; 2. Then, in Constantine, John carries out with his final efforts of defiance in order to see his beloved in the afterlife. All of the other characters referring to him as ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù goes a very long way in creating this fun continuity, but it‚Äôs Keanu‚Äôs cold and calculated demeanor that makes Constantine feel like a sequel in a series about our protagonist. In addition, John develops a quasi-romance with a new woman, though it never actually goes anywhere. In the John Wick series, that would have been ridiculous. But as a contiguous story about our pal John, it actually fits the narrative. I encourage anyone who enjoys either of those films to approach them as a series, it will create some genuinely entertaining continuity. ",normal

"Nicolas Cage made 29 direct-to-video movies in the 2010s. I watched all of them. A couple of weeks ago, I showed my son National Treasure, and the whole time I kept thinking ‚Äúdamn, I really miss Nic Cage‚Äù. I knew that he was pretty much in the DTV world for the past 10 years, but I didn‚Äôt realize to what level. Turns out that Nicolas Cage made 29 direct-to-video movies in the 2010‚Äôs, and almost immediately, I was determined to watch every one of them. So I did. In no particular order:  
  
**The Trust. 7/10.**  
A not half-bad way to start things off. It's a little under-cooked at a brisk 90 minutes, but him and Elijah Wood play well of each other. Cage gives his character some quirky traits in the first half coming across as a likeable guy trying to do something he shouldn't, but quickly turns to full-on bad guy in the second half. There's a good story here but it's never fully realized. We are treated to a Cage Out though in the third act, which is always welcome. 1 down, 28 to go.  
  
**Kill Chain. 8/10.**  
This one was really enjoyable! It's sort-of 3 different stories or vignettes that all come together in the second half, which is where Cage enters the picture. He never Cage's Out, playing pretty restrained the whole time (though there is one moment where he comes close). The writing's a bit ham-fisted, and the characters are pure stereotype, but it's well crafted and a very entertaining 90 minutes. So far so good. With 27 to go, things are looking up!  
  
**The Runner. 5/10.**  
Unfocused and uneventful. It‚Äôs well cast and there‚Äôs a feeling of ‚Äúthis is a real movie‚Äù but it wants to be too many things. There‚Äôs a decent movie buried in here, but at a brisk 82 minutes, it‚Äôs hard to find. There‚Äôs no Cage Rage on display here, instead playing it very understated. It‚Äôs quality acting though. Three films into this little odyssey, and so far these are more than just paychecks for him, doing the best he can with what he‚Äôs given.  
  
**Rage. 6/10.**  
It‚Äôs OK, but it‚Äôs sloppy. The whole time I‚Äôm wondering why nothing seems to piece together, and it‚Äôs ultimately all in service of a shock ending that undermines everything that came before. Once again, Cage is solid in this. He keeps things entertaining where others may have had me checking out. One intense Cage Out, but I expected more based on the title and premise. Nevertheless, we journey forward. 4 down, 25 to go.  
  
**Between Worlds. 10/10.**  
I‚Äôm going to be fast and loose with the spoilers on this one. Joe is a down-on-his-luck truck driver who lost his wife and kid to a house fire some years prior. In the first 10 minutes of the movie, Joe is at a gas station pit stop where he finds Julie being choked out by some dude. Joe steps in and knocks him out, much to her dissatisfaction. Why? Because 1 hour prior, her daughter was in a motorcycle accident and is now in a coma, and because of a childhood incident, knows that if she is unconscious she can cross over to ‚Äúthe other side‚Äù. So her plan was to have some rando choke her in a rest stop bathroom so she could guide her daughter back to the land of the living. Joe interrupted the process, so he offers to give her a ride to the hospital. Once there, she asks Joe to choke her in the hallway so she can try again to reach her. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äù goes wrong, and instead, Joe‚Äôs dead wife is brought back in the daughters body.  
The next 30 minutes see Joe moving in with Julie and playing house while dead-wife-in-daughter (DWID from this point on) slowly creeps around trying to seduce him. It‚Äôs the halfway point when Joe is made aware what is happening, and by extension Julie and the movies 1 other character. They all accept this very easily.  
It‚Äôs around this time that we get to a scene where Joe and DWID are fucking, interspersed with a scene where Joe and his wife before she died are also fucking. In both of these scenarios, his wife wants him to read poetry while they fuck. The poetry Joe proceeds to read in both scenes is from a book titled, I shit you not, ‚ÄúMemories by Nicolas Cage‚Äù.  
More stuff happens, and at the end of the movie, through various circumstances, Joe is doing a classic Cage scream-cry, one arm hugging a jack-in-the-box that presumably belonged to his daughter, and in the other, he is dousing himself in gasoline. He then lights a cigarette, which of course ignites his entire body, and he smokes in a completely normal manner while his body burns. This all happens while Leader of the Pack is playing, a song that holds absolutely no significance to anything that has come prior.  
Throughout, music that feels directly ripped from Twin Peaks is playing, and the whole atmosphere is begging to feel like David Lynch. Is the kind of movie you would find on Cinemax at 2am on a random Wednesday in 1995. It‚Äôs fucking glorious.  
At this particular moment in my life, my greatest fear is that with 24 films to go, I will never again reach these heights.  
  
**Inconceivable. 7/10.**  
It‚Äôs your typical nanny-isn‚Äôt-who-they-seem-to-be sort of deal, but it‚Äôs actually entertaining enough. It‚Äôs all pretty rote stuff, but there‚Äôs nothing offensively bad here. Cage gets 4th billing, with absolutely nothing to do other than play the can‚Äôt-see-what‚Äôs-really-going-on husband. He‚Äôs still decent at it, but this actually does feel like a paycheck movie for him, given that I can‚Äôt find any reason he would have looked at the script and thought he had something interesting he could do.  
  
**The Humanity Bureau. 3/10.**  
Lame, cheap, uninteresting near-future story that doesn‚Äôt have anything new to say that hasn‚Äôt already been said better in dozens of other movies. Cage is actually asleep at the wheel on this one, just kind of making his way through. In fairness, he isn‚Äôt given anything to do. Thus far, these movies have managed pretty decent supporting casts. Here though, it‚Äôs pretty much Canadian TV extras. Things are starting to feel rocky with 22 left.  
  
**Outcast. 4/10.**  
Meh. Anakin Skywalker is a 12th Century Knight escorting hunted royalty to safe haven. It‚Äôs surprisingly not as cheap as I expected, but it‚Äôs a completely unoriginal and boring movie. My only reason for watching, Sir Nicolas, does not even enter the picture until the final 30 minutes. He really hams it up with the old English accent, but he can‚Äôt save the movie at this point. Things are gonna need to start turning around soon. Maybe a Between Worlds injection every 3 movies.  
  
**Primal. 6/10.**  
A movie where a Jaguar, a killer and Nicolas Cage are all loose on a boat in the middle of the ocean should not be this dull. It‚Äôs no fault of Cage, who hurls some great insults throughout when not chomping on a cigar, and the rest of the cast seems game (except you, Jean Grey), so it really comes down to the film itself, which just doesn‚Äôt use its premise to the fullest. The whole thing is visually bland, too. It‚Äôs so muted it borders on black and white sometimes.  
I had high hopes going in, but thanks to this little journey of mine, I now know director Nick Powell from yesterday‚Äôs Outcast endeavor, and as soon as his name popped up in the opening credits, those hopes came crashing down.  
  
**Running with the Devil. 7/10.**  
Flawed and sloppily made, but still entertaining enough, mostly due to its surprisingly A-list cast that never gets to do much. It's not nearly as cool as it wants to be though. What Feast made a great joke about in its opening few minutes, this movie tries to do for real, to eye rolling effect. Cage is very low-key in this, with Laurence Fishburne of all people having the most fun. His characters sexual proclivities serve no purpose, and an early montage of them would be pointless if he wasn't so much fun to watch. Perhaps the biggest disappointment though is that Nicolas Cage and Adam Goldberg get some screen time together, and rather than take this opportunity to have them out-anxious each other, nothing comes of it. I'm so d-d-d-d-d-disappointed.  
  
**A Score to Settle. 8/10.**  
Went in expecting a typical revenge flick, but was pleasantly surprised to see something more. Cage is really great in this, and I'm more and more impressed by him with each movie. He really disappears into each role, never doing the same thing twice even if he sometimes is playing similar characters. There are a few moments of the Cage Madness here, much in the same way that Christopher Walken or Sam Rockwell try to dance in every movie they do, but the more subdued acting takes center stage.  
  
**The Frozen Ground. 8/10.**  
Tight cat-and-mouse type that focuses on the procedural more than the thriller aspect and is better for it. Cage is in top form, and Cusack ain't half bad either. Might I want to dip my toe into his DTV output next? Perhaps. 17 to go first.
  
**211. 1/10.**  
Jesus Fucking Christ.  
  
**Dying of the Light. 6/10.**  
**Dark. 7/10.**  
As it exists in its official form, it‚Äôs a middling CIA thriller with an intriguing Cage performance being the most interesting part.  
In it‚Äôs ‚ÄúDirector‚Äôs Cut‚Äù, which is even less of an actual movie than Donner‚Äôs Superman II, everything is much more intriguing, and had Schrader been able to make an actual final cut, this could have had the potential to be great.
The concept of a dying CIA agent spending his last days trying to catch a dying terrorist is a solid one, but it isn‚Äôt fully realized in either version as is. Cage‚Äôs performance is a little manic in both, but more fleshed out and sympathetic in the later. CIA business aside, I‚Äôd have liked to watch 90 minutes of Cage just losing his mind. Actually that movie could be 3 hours long and still not be enough.  
  
**Stolen. 9/10.**  
A cheap Taken knock-off crossed with a heist movie that‚Äôs a stupid amount of fun. Josh Lucas is gloriously unhinged here, out Cage-ing the man himself. Can the remaining 14 keep up?  
  
**Arsenal. 5/10.**  
DTV mediocrity that tries too hard to be cool. Cage is hamming it up in a small-ish role, and certainly makes his scenes entertaining, but the rest of the DTV-All-Stars are bland.  
  
**Seeking Justice. 8/10.**  
It‚Äôs packaged as a revenge thriller, but it‚Äôs much more in line with 13 Sins/The Game/Nerve. The whole thing is pretty ridiculous, but it‚Äôs a lot of fun to watch. It doesn‚Äôt use its New Orleans setting as well as Stolen, but the two would make for a hell of a double feature.  
  
**Dog Eat Dog. 7/10.**  
Weird movie, but compellingly so. Shrader gets his editing jollies off that he couldn‚Äôt do on Dying of the Light, but I‚Äôm not sure it does much to add to a movie that is otherwise a pretty simple tale of low-level criminals wanting to hit it big. Cage and Dafoe is a great pairing, but it‚Äôs never fully utilized, outside of an odd, half-naked condiment fight.  
  
**Vengeance: A Love Story. ?/10.**  
After the first 10 minutes, where you can fill a card 100% while playing Cop Trope Bingo, you get the deformed child of two very different movies. In the first movie you have a fairly dark, if poorly constructed, movie about the aftermath of an assault and rape where any one aspect of which could have been explored, but instead the writer and director give us a Whitman's Sampler of plot threads with none of them fleshed out beyond the initial idea. Nicolas Cage is not in this movie.  
In the second movie however, Nicolas Cage stars in what I can only think to describe of as City of Angels 2. After tragically losing his dear Maggie to that damn logging truck, Seth moves out of LA and assumes the identity of John Drormoor, becoming a policeman who years later becomes involved in the lives of a mother and daughter in the aftermath of a violent attack. After what is obviously Seth/John trying to communicate with Cassiel at the edge of a waterfall for guidance, he is given a much warranted promotion from Angel to Avenging Angel, serving due justice to the duos attackers.  
These two movies have been edited together. I don't know how to give this a numbered rating. There are 10 remaining.  
  
**USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage. 3/10.**  
A poorly made movie that plays like a work of complete fiction. The use of a famous quote 50 years before it was coined is particularly atrocious, as is Tom Sizemore, acting as though he were Tobias F√ºnke trying his best at an Academy Award.
This is the first straight-up bad movie thus far. Up until this point they‚Äôve either crossed over into so-bad-they‚Äôre-good or Cage has given a performance that keeps things entertaining and watchable. USS Indianapolis is just a lame movie across the board.  
  
**Joe. 7/10.**  
A solid movie with a really great performance by Cage, but I found its most engaging storyline sidelined by too many others that make the movie feel really long. There is no fun to be had here, and little worth revisiting down the road.  
  
**Color Out of Space. 8/10.**  
Delivered what I was hoping for on most accounts, but continues to prove that adapting Lovecraft, especially on a low budget, is very difficult. There are some real horrors on display though proving that practical effects are still king, and Cage is great, showing again his talent and desire to really put his all into every role.  
  
**Grand Isle. 6/10.**  
A came cast keeps things going for the first hour, which is essentially a single location play, but it all starts to fall apart in the third act. Grammer has about 10 minutes of collective screen time and only 30 seconds of those shared with Cage. KaDee Strickland is the most surprising here, matching Cage's enthusiasm and keeping the whole thing very entertaining, but it ultimately amounts to very little. The low-budget also doesn't help, constantly referencing a hurricane that is never seen. A shame really, cause you can see the potential for something greater here.  
  
**Looking Glass. 5/10.**  
A thriller without thrills, trying so hard to be mysterious and failing at each try. Cage is given nothing to do but walk around and look confused for 100 minutes. Things rarely happen, and when they do they make no sense by the end. There's a solid first act setup with some cool ideas, and every single one is wasted. I was hoping for something along the lines of 8MM, but this was not that.  
The final 5 remain.  
  
**Mom and Dad. 8/10.**  
A deranged concept which Cage is perfectly suited for, but like my issue with Nicholson in The Shining, he‚Äôs already a little crazy before he goes crazy. I love the tone set with the opening credits, but Taylor goes to frenetic too quickly, never letting us settle in before cranking things up to 11.  
All that aside, it‚Äôs a totally bonkers movie and watching Cage let loose is always 100% entertainment. As a whole it just lacks the finesse to bump this up to top tier.  
  
**Trespass. 8/10.**  
There‚Äôs more than a few stupid character decisions, and I don‚Äôt love the way the flashback structure is done, but the performances across the board are really good, and the intensity level is consistent throughout.  
  
**Pay the Ghost. 7/10.**  
A pretty decent spookfest that creates a moody atmosphere and some chilling imagery. While ‚ÄúColor Out of Space‚Äù falls in the horror genre, and Cage has done more than a few thrillers, this is the only actual scary movie he‚Äôs ever done. I‚Äôd like to see more.  
  
**Army of One. 4/10.**  
Cage sounds like he‚Äôs doing a Rain Man impression the entire time, and the movie is narrated in a Wake Up, Ron Burgundy style which is just awful. A very unfunny movie that is more annoying than anything else.  
  
**Mandy. 10/10.**  
There was no better way to end this journey. Cage is smartly restrained for a majority of the picture, but when the beast is let loose, THE BEAST IS LET LOOSE! A fever dream of a movie that delivers on all accounts, and something that will be re-watched in years to come.

EDIT: In order to keep the title streamlined I said ""direct-to-video"". Perhaps what I should have said was ""movies that did not have a nationwide theatrical release"".

EDIT 2: You are all incredibly kind! I very much enjoyed this, and it only furthered my appreciation for Nic Cage. He currently has 4 movies in post-production, and I‚Äôm eager to watch each one of them. To answer a common question, each movie was reviewed on its own merits, and not on any sort of curve or in-comparison to another movie.

"My 12 year old is pissed at me because he accidentally proved that Die Hard is indeed a Christmas movie. [SPOILERS] Last year, I introduced him to Die Hard and I said it was one of my favorite Christmas movies. All year long, he has been trying to argue that it's not a Christmas movie per se, it's just a movie that happens at Christmastime. 

My argument was that the whole reason John McClane was even in Los Angeles was to see his family for Christmas and the only reason he was at Nakatomi Plaza was for the Xmas party. He wasn't having it. 

So tonight I introduced Lethal Weapon, which honestly, I had forgotten was also set around Christmas. But there we are, watching the opening credits and they're playing jingle bell rock, everything is decorated for Xmas, everyone's saying ""Merry Christmas"" to each other. So I start saying ""look, another Christmas movie like Die Hard!"" because I know he's going to argue that it's not. 

He impressed me this time: he said that if you take Christmas out, it doesn't change the story. And he's 100% right; Lethal Weapon can stand on its own without the story changing even if it happens in the third week of August. Christmas is not at all integral to any part of that movie. 

So I pointed out that Gruber's gang in Die Hard needed the reduced security and number of employees in the building for a nighttime Christmas party for them to get into the building easier, but they also needed enough employees at the party to create a hostage situation that would get the FBI out so they could turn off the power, letting them drill into the vault. 

You take Xmas out and they don't have their opportunity to make their heist. 

And again, McClane is in that building specifically because it's Christmas. 

No Christmas, no Die Hard. 

He's not happy about it. 

So tomorrow we're going to have to watch Love Actually and see what he thinks.",normal

"Disney lost the Best Animated Film for the first time since 2006 After Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse won Best Animated Film last night, it got me thinking about how it seemed like finally an animated film not made by Disney or Pixar won that category. So I went and looked it up and sure enough, Disney/Pixar has won the Oscar in this category every single year they had a movie up for nomination, since 2006 (in 2011, they didn‚Äôt have a movie up for nomination AND YES, as everyone keeps asking in the comment section: Rango won this year. Disney did not have a movie nominated, and Rango won, and no, Rango is not a Disney movie). In 2006, they lost the Oscar to Happy Feet (the Disney movie up for nomination was Cars).

As much of a Disney movie lover as I am, I‚Äôm so glad that the Academy didn‚Äôt just blindly hand over the award to Disney again, but actually chose the best of the bunch. And I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs Into The Spider-Verse. This movie deserves it.

Edit: to all those confused about Marvel‚Äôs role in this movie, u/Viceprezbacon has a great comment below summarizing the relationships:
‚ÄúTo all confused about Disney and Spiderman. Sony owns the rights to spiderman. The Marvel attributed with being involved with this movie is the comic book company. Disney was in no way involved with this movie. They own Marvel Studios, who produce the live action movies and have no affiliation with Sony in this regard (outside the spiderman deal).‚Äù",normal

"FUCK YOU NETFLIX STOP CUTTING OFF THE CREDITS You know that feeling when you've just watched two and a half hours of an amazing movie, and the credits roll, and the specially-composed-to-be-epic end-credits sountrack piece starts to play and you're like ""aaahhh... time to revel in the emotion of the ending of that film, and take a minute to think about what it all means as this beautiful epic music plays to recontextualize what I've seen and put it in a more viscer... OH FUCK WHY THE FUCK IS THE TRAILER FOR 'ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK' FUCKING UP MY SHIT!?!?!?!?!?!?""

Seriously, STOP FUCKING DOING THAT.  I KNOW YOUR SHOWS FUCKING EXIST.  LET ME HAVE AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF COMEDOWN BEFORE SHOVELING YOUR NEXT SERIES IN MY GODDAMN FACE ALREADY"".

I mean, shit, if even there was a button that said ""let me watch the end credits"" I'd be OK with it, but NOPE THERE'S FUCKING NOTHING.

Netflix, you had our backs five years ago, and now you're just as fucking bad as anyone else.  LISTEN TO ME, STOP THIS SHIT.

(((( MEGA EDIT ))))

 Well... holy smokes, le blow up... and some of you have no sense of humour.  A few comments.

a) I don't hate Netflix in general.  People saying ""just stop paying for it"" are being ridiculous.  I even get that a lot of people *like* the autoplay feature, which is great.  I just don't like that it's *automatic* and there's no option to turn it off (for me, at least).

b) I think for some reason you guys have options when you watch that I don't.  None of your suggestions work for me, or seem available.  Probably depends how you're watching Netflix.  I'm using a Sony smart TV.  Maybe I truly am ""retarded"", as some of you insist.  But I don't have the settings menu ya'll are talking about, that's for sure.

c) I'm howling at the comments about ""entitlement"".  Uh, what?  I'm paying for a service here, not asking for my student loans to be cleared.  If we don't like something we're paying for, we're ""entitled"" so say something about it.

d) As for the ""don't get so excited"" posts.  Well, firstly, alcohol.  Secondly, obviously the issue isn't that big of a deal, that's why the obviously over the top response.  I dunno, I thought it was funny.  Certainly didn't think anyone would care about it.  What's really interesting is how pissed off people get that I even posted it in the first place.  Oh, sorry, let's get back to how exciting that fifth poster is for (insert 483rd Marvel sequel here).

e) Some of you don't sit through the credits.  That's cool, but some of us (apparently a *lot* of us) do.  

f) If you've never gotten to the end of a film and felt the need to sit there and think about it for a bit... that's... really sad.

g) Weirdly, the thing that set me off was *Blue Thunder*.  I loved this movie as a kid, loved the shitty electronic score... so when I got the end I'm like ""oh yeah, there's this extendo version of the theme which was pretty sweet"" and then I get there and BOOM it's like NO MUSIC ONLY TRAILER.  And it made me thought of other times when I wanted to just relax and think about what I'd seen, and popped.  Er, half-popped.  ",normal

"'Cats' - Review Thread Review embargo just lifted for *Cats*. Apparently it's purr-ty bad. This is getting **absolutely destroyed** by critics. Some of these reviews are legit ""worst of the year"" contenders. Lots of savage (and hilarious) 1/10 or 2/10 reviews. This movie just went from Oscar-hopeful to Razzies-favorite. It's a total trainwreck.

On the bright side, there will at least be some award-winning puns/memes to come out of this. Looks like the trailer backlash was warranted after all.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/cats-film-review-musical-movie-2019-taylor-swift/) 

> Andrew Lloyd Webber‚Äôs feline fantasy musical becomes a garish hairball. It‚Äôs hard to ‚Äúruin‚Äù Webber‚Äôs already strange musical, but Tom Hooper‚Äôs wrongheaded attempt certainly tries. Tom Hooper‚Äôs jarring fever dream of a spectacle is like something that escaped from Dr. Moreau‚Äôs creature laboratory instead of a poet‚Äôs and a composer‚Äôs feline (uni)verse, an un-catty valley hybrid of physical and digital that unsettles and crashes way more often than it enchants.

[Rendy Reviews](https://www.rendyreviews.com/movies//cats-review)

"""Passengers"" with Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt is one of the most transparently ""wish fulfillment"" movies I've seen It's borderline Wattpad material. 

Have you ever fantasized about being stuck on an island with Jennifer Lawrence but don't want to worry about pesky little things like scavenging for food and supplies or basic survival? Well, say no more, because here you'll be trapped in an automated, luxurious space cruise with Jennifer Lawrence. Your every need will be met by helpful, sassy British bartenders and you'll live out your days in languorous comfort.

You won't have to worry about any competition for J-Law's attention, of course, because everyone else in the cruise will be conveniently asleep in their cryo chambers. Except for the hottest woman, whom you woke up in a moment of ~~horniness~~ weakness that the movie will bend over backwards to justify (more on that later). 

But worry not, you'll get to keep your status as a relatable, salt-of-the-earth, blue collar everyday guy and still partake of the ship's luxurious priviliges because J-Law will use *her* VIP bracelet to procure the best food and accommodations for you, cheap ticket holder. Whew! That was close!

And then, eventually, of course, J-Law will find out you woke her up and basically doomed her to a slow death with nobody else but you by her side and prevented her from fulfilling her life-long dream of being the first journalist to set foot on humanity's newly-colonized planet. BUT, before she can get *too* angry about a simple faux pas like that, Laurence Fishburne will make a timely appearance and with his Old Man Wisdom and in his dying breath (we don't want ol' Laurence staying for too long and stealing your girl, right?), he will tell J-Law to forgive you because you need to stay together, for...reasons, even though he doesn't know any of you.

And if that wasn't enough to make J-Law forget you murdered her and ruined her life, there's a sudden mechanical problem that threatens the lives of everyone onboard and only you with your humble, mechanical prowess can fix it, heroically risking your life in the process. 

But you'll survive of course, and you'll save the day so hard that J-Law will not only forgive you but she'll fall in love with you so completely that she'll refuse to use the surplus cryo chamber and instead choose to spend the rest of her life wandering around an empty ship with you, because women don't need those silly professional goals, they just need a man to make them happy. Ain't that a lovely fantasy?",normal
"Elijah Wood, Daniel Radcliffe and Robert Pattinson need to team up for the most bizarre indie film of all time The three of them each got their big break as the star of a big budget film franchise but since then have revealed their true talents playing in some of the most interesting (and frankly bizarre) indie films of the last decade.

Not only have they starred in some of the strangest films to date but their involvement has often helped secure funding for independent directors who might otherwise struggle to find the money. Elijah Wood even runs his own production company to help up and coming directors get their weird and wonderful ideas to the big screen. 

I'd love to see the three of them get together for the weirdest, most bizarre and out there independent film imaginable. If the stars of Swiss Army Man, Come to Daddy and High Life can't do it, then no one can!",normal

"The transformation of Rambo from broken veteran to unstoppable killing machine is a real cultural loss. There really isn‚Äôt a more idiotic devolution of a character in modern popular culture than that of Rambo. If you haven‚Äôt seen the first film, First Blood, it‚Äôs a quite cynical and anti-military movie. Rambo isn‚Äôt a psychotic nationalist, he‚Äôs a broken machine. He was made to be an indestructible soldier by an uncaring military at the cost of his humanity. He‚Äôs a character so good at violence it scares him, and the only person he actually kills in the first film is both in self defense and largely on accident. It‚Äôs not even an action film, it‚Äôs a drama about veterans who cannot re-enter society after a meaningless war. The climax of the film isn‚Äôt Rambo killing, but sobbing about how horrifying his experiences were.

Then, in the second film, we get a neck shattering 180 into full on Ronald Reagan revisionism of the war in Vietnam. Rambo 2 perpetuates several popular and resilient myths about the Vietnam War, such as that American POWs were still there after the war and that the war would have been won by Americans of only we (the American people) had allowed them to win.

To say Rambo 2 is cultural vandalism would be putting it mildly. It‚Äôs a cinematic tragedy. They took a poignant anti war film and made it into a jingoistic Cold War fantasy.",normal

"On Dunkirk, Nolan strapped an IMAX camera in a plane and launched it into the ocean to capture the crash landing. It sunk quicker than expected. 90 minutes later, divers retrieved the film from the seabottom. After development, the footage was found to be ""all there, in full color and clarity."" From *American Cinematographer*, August edition's interview with Dunkirk Director of Photography Hoyte van Hoytema - 


>They decided to place an Imax camera into a stunt plane - which was 'unmanned and catapulted from a ship,' van Hoytema says - and crash it into the sea. The crash, however, didn't go quite as expected. 

>'Our grips did a great job building a crash housing around the Imax camera to withstand the physical impact and protect the camera from seawater, and we had a good plan to retrieve the camera while the wreckage was still afloat,' van Hoytema says. 'Unfortunately, the plane sunk almost instantly, pulling the rig and camera to the sea bottom. In all, the camera was under for [more than 90 minutes] until divers could retrieve it. The housing was completely compromised by water pressure, and the camera and mag had filled with [brackish] water. But Jonathan Clark, our film loader, rinsed the retrieved mag in freshwater and cleaned the film in the dark room with freshwater before boxing it and submerging it in freshwater.' 


>[1st AC Bob] Hall adds, 'FotoKem advised us to drain as much of the water as we could from the can, [as it] is not a water-tight container and we didn't want the airlines to not accept something that is leaking. This was the first experience of sending waterlogged film to a film lab across the Atlantic Ocean to be developed. It was uncharted territory.""

>As van Hoytema reports, ""FotoKem carefully developed it to find out of the shot was all there, in full color and clarity. This material would have been lost if shot digitally.""  ",normal
"1917 and Parasite are the current front-runners for Best Picture. If either wins tonight, it will be the first Best Picture winner with no acting noms since Slumdog Millionaire won 11 years ago. This would make either film one of only 12 films in 92 years to win BP without any nominations for its actors, with the latest film being Slumdog Millionaire in 2009.

Also, if we assume that Parasite wins Best Original Screenplay and Mendes takes home Best Director for 1917...

* if **1917** wins, it'll be the first winner with no acting noms or a Screenplay win since **Braveheart** in 1996.
* if **Parasite** wins, it'll be the first winner with no acting noms or a Director win since **Around the World in 80 Days** back in 1957.

EDIT: Looks like Parasite managed to take home both Director AND Picture! Congratulations!",normal
"Galaxy Quest is still one of a kind. It blends the line between being a parody and tribute to Star Trek, while also being a legit Science Fiction film flawlessly Galaxy Quest is incredible. I can't think of any other film like it. First it's an excellent and loving parody to Star Trek. Second, it's actually a great science fiction adventure film with a good plot. The comedy is great, but the dramatic moments are just as impact. The part where Tim Allen has to explain to Balthzar that they are actors is heartbreaking. Everyone involved with the film seemed to totally understand and buy into what they were making. I can't think of another film that blends the line between parody and drama so flawlessly. Space Balls for example is a great parody, but has no serious sci-fi elements. 

EDIT: When I thought about it, maybe Ghostbusters is the best comparison. It's not a parody in any way, but it blends the line between comedy and it's horror elements perfectly. 

Edit 2: wow I didn't expect this to blow up. Here is an excellent spoiler analysis from one of my favorite youtube channels.

"Edge of Tomorrow is the perfect blockbuster movie Seriously, it amazes me that this movie was not a giant hit.  Most modern blockbuster movies feel like the same tired retread of cliches, but Edge of Tomorrow has everything you could want in a fun action movie:

* Dark humor
* Unpredictability
* The protagonist has this huge character arc, which is very unusual for Tom Cruise
* Great action scenes
* Bill Paxton
* Fantastic alien design
* An awesome spin on Groundhog day
* Perfectly encapsulates what it is like to play a tough video game
* Great chemistry between the two lead characters
* If you love Tom Cruise, you'll love this movie.  If you hate Tom Cruise, you'll love this movie because he dies so much.
* The movie both starts quickly and wraps up quickly without it feeling cheap
* A badass female character with a neat backstory that makes her feel more genuine than the usual cliche obligatory female badass character.  Plus, she fights aliens in large mech suit with a frickin' helicopter blade as her sword.
* There isn't a single dull scene

Hopefully someday the stars align and we can finally get a sequel.",normal

"Hope in the Dark by Rebecca Solnit For those feeling the sadness, despair, anguish, fear and anger of this week, I highly recommend this book. I first read it in 2016 and it has been my guiding light since, especially in the face of political upheaval (on all sides of the spectrum) and the lure of pessimism and apathy. Below is one of my favorite passages from the book:

‚ÄúTo hope is to gamble. It‚Äôs to bet on the future, on your desires, on the possibility that an open heart and uncertainty is better than gloom and safety. To hope is dangerous, and yet it is the opposite of fear, for to live is to risk. 

I say all this because hope is not like a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch, feeling lucky. I say it because hope is an ax you break down doors with in an emergency; because hope should shove you out the door, because it will take everything you have to steer the future away from endless war, from the annihilation of the earth‚Äôs treasures and the grinding down of the poor and marginal. Hope just means another world is possible, not promised, not guaranteed. Hope calls for action; action is impossible without hope.‚Äù 

Happy reading! ",normal
"Characters who fascinate you and make you feel the most intense or complex feelings?  By most intense, I mean someone who makes you feel very strong feelings (e.g., hating them with a passion). And by complex, I Mean someone who triggers a combination of very different emotions, like anger but also love.

What happened was that I was having a chat with a fellow reader who said he likes Of Mice and Men, in particular Lennie Small, for whom he feels only one thing: Sorrow. He pities the guy. That's it. Kind of like how he feels about animals because they are innocent. 

I appreciate that perspective and at times I do feel the same way, being drawn to characters who don't trigger too many feelings in me. 

Sometimes those feelings can be intense though. Like Palpatine in Star Wars. You just feel negative feelings toward the guy. And hate him with a passion.

But I feel that more realistic characters usually trigger a combination of different feelings. That is how a friend described her feelings toward Heathcliff. She said she feels compassion toward him, yet hates him. I said for me it's very difficult to feel any affection for him. When he was young, yes, but later, no. 

Things were different with Holden Caulfield. She just hated the brat, whereas I felt a lot of different feelings toward him: anger, compassion, sorrow, confusion, etc. Not initially but when I reread the book as I got older and felt I understood him a little better.

"The Passenger by Cormac McCarthy Today, I finished reading The Passenger. Wow‚Ä¶just, wow‚Ä¶what a remarkable book! The Passenger is not like other McCarthy books. It‚Äôs more of a mystery, and I rather enjoyed seeing McCarthy‚Äôs style of writing be used to make a mystery come to life. 

I have a strange habit of not researching McCarthy‚Äôs books enough before reading them. I stumbled into Blood Meridian and was unprepared for the violence in that story. Meanwhile, I stumbled into The Passenger and was unprepared for the depth of sadness the characters experienced and the depth of sadness those characters would lead me to experience. I‚Äôm just a guy trying to enjoy a book during his lunch break. Instead, I find myself deep in mourning for Bobby and Alicia. I feel an incredible sense of loss after reading this book.

I realize this is a disjointed post. Was anyone else in shambles after finishing The Passenger? Should I anticipate more of the same in Stella Maris?",normal
"Autumn made me love reading I just finished the last book of the Autumn series by David Moody. It took around 2 years of on and off reading and many other books in between.

I struggled with reading growing up and was always frustrated trying to read for fun. A few years ago, I learned how to speed read more, which allowed me to start consuming books at a normal to faster pace.

I love zombies so much. This has to be my favorite zombie story ever, especially with the greater focus on the experience of loss from the survivors.

I have read a number of other books in between. I learned I love romance books, especially the steamy ones!

It seems to really enjoy reading, you have to pick books you like. You wouldn't watch a movie you weren't interested in.",normal
"Rebecca by du Maurier and anxiety I just finished reading Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier and really enjoyed scanning through some reddit posts discussing it!

I was shocked that this was labeled as a romance novel on the cover of the copy I read. There was truly nothing romantic about it, only sad and horrifying.

The narrator reminded me of a younger version of myself in a lot of ways. I have OCD and one of my compulsions is rehearsing what I would do/say for any possible scenario in addition to people pleasing and just anxiety in general. I am NOT saying the narrator was written with OCD, but it‚Äôs very obvious she is riddled with anxiety. The way we see her carry out what people could say and what she would say reminds me a lot of my own compulsions. Even down to the way Maxim describes the narrator mouthing silent words and dissociating when she does it. 

The narrator also doesn‚Äôt seem to have any family or caretaker ties. When she is excited to send a letter, she can‚Äôt think of anyone to write to, except her old employer. While she mentions telling Maxim about her childhood, the audience is never clued in about anything to do with her family. I come from a very unstable childhood with abuse. I would get so anxious when people around me were sad or upset, constantly hyper aware of facial expressions, tone, and needs. I always felt like I had to fix everything for everyone in order to be safe. Seeing the narrator‚Äôs inner dialogue reminds me a lot of what I was like.

Maxim never shows any kindness or thought towards the narrator. She seems to view this as a response to his mourning, rather than his selfish nature. I think her anxiety, age, and lack of family fulfilled Max‚Äôs desire for total control in a marriage. She purposefully was written to have no autonomy- just doing whatever she‚Äôs told. Really, she just had to fulfill a figurehead of a wife for the look of Manderley. He reminds me so much of past relationships I‚Äôve had, even down to his ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no good for you‚Äù angsty outbursts.

With people pleasing anxiety, all the red flags of those around you go out the window. She‚Äôs so scared of getting in trouble and getting rejected. The narrator also can‚Äôt see the danger because of her inexperience. As a young girl, the idea of an older man dating you makes you feel mature. Then as you age, you realize that the ‚Äòolder man‚Äô that is into a teenager is a creepy loser.

The ending makes me so sad. Maxim is still in control of her life. 

Long story short - it‚Äôs a cautionary tale. Also, thank god I got therapy so I can view the narrator in correlation to my past and not to who I am today.

Edit: also forgot to add: Maxim seems to feel no remorse over ending someone‚Äôs life! It‚Äôs been a year and he doesn‚Äôt share any reflection on his actions or behavior, nor the impact Rebecca‚Äôs death had on those around her. Only regret over the possibility of getting caught.",normal
"When was the last time you delayed finishing a book because you were enjoying it so much you didn't want it to end? I know this sound dumb but I have this weird habit where if I'm really enjoying a book, which happens rarely enough, I sort of don't want it to end. With movies, I guess I've never actually stopped a movie to save it for another day. Maybe it never really occurred to me or maybe because watching TV or movies is a way more passive hobby. That's not true of books. Reading involves effort. And the more effort I put into it, if I enjoy it, the harder it is for me to end it. 

This usually happens with longer books that I have read. Naturally, these books take their time to establish the setting and introduce everybody to you gradually, so by the time you are in the middle of the book, you sort of feel like you have gotten to know the character quite well, like friends or family members.

For example, with Les Mis√©rables. The last few pages took forever to read. I didn't want it to end. I wanted there to be a Les Miserables 2 and Les Miserables 3, as often is with Hollywood movies that make a lot of money. I wanted to see what Jean Valjean is doing, how is Cosette managing, what new adventures await them.

So, after really having a great time with a book, I search like crazy for other highly rated books by the author, but often they do not match the intensity and power of the original, unless you happen to have started with a lesser known work by the author, which I rarely do. I go for their best books first. Only if I enjoy it, then I go back and try to find everything else they have written.

Anybody know what I'm talking about?",normal
"Now would be the time for the authors of textbooks to release copies to libraries and internet archives.  The potential money lost means nothing if people can‚Äôt access your book at all. We need to give people unfettered access to all educational media and text, it‚Äôs going to be rough for people in US colleges for the foreseeable future. The libraries are going to tough it out, but we have to support them as best we can. 

The thought of being unable to source information worries me greatly. As a student, I‚Äôve already made a plan to reach out to a few professors in my major to ask for a list of essential readings, but preserving educational materials (and all forms of art) needs to be a community effort to prevent the distortion of information and the spread of propaganda through educational material.

"Do you abandon reading a book if it‚Äôs feeling like a chore? Im reading The Liar by Stephen Fry and although there are parts of the book I enjoyed I don‚Äôt particularly care for the main character of the story. I don‚Äôt feel curious about what will happen next and I kind of really don‚Äôt care? The initial chapter was supposed to draw me into the story I guess? It just didn‚Äôt. If anything it confused me, I‚Äôm being thrown in and out different timelines in this character‚Äôs life and I‚Äôm sort feeling annoyed with this writing style. I mean Stephen Fry is eloquent and witty I do like that but when a book acts like a movie I start getting confused? Is it just me? I have come across a couple of authors who do this is there any way to tell as I‚Äôm reading this is happening? I always find myself going back a few pages thinking I missed something just to realise it‚Äôs some sort of flashback or a different timeline altogether? 

What do you do when the book is not pulling you in? Should I cut my losses and start on something else? I honestly wouldn‚Äôt even mind someone to spoil it for me I just can‚Äôt be bothered to read it through anymore. I‚Äôm longing for a book which I can‚Äôt read fast enough! ",normal

"I have just read ""Why I‚Äôm no longer talking to white people about race"" by British author Reni Eddo-Lodge. I was disappointed. I have just read ""Why I‚Äôm no longer talking to white people about race"" by British author Reni Eddo-Lodge

This is the goodreads page¬†[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33606119-why-i-m-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33606119-why-i-m-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race)

The book originated from a blog post by the author; she wrote about it in The Guardian  
[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race)

My opinion of the book is not positive.¬†**It's almost as if there were two books, written by two different authors:**

**One part is a reasonably well-written work on the history and structure of racism,**¬†focused on the UK as the author is British (so there will be differences with the US, of course). This part is interesting and well-researched. I do strongly believe that British people should be more familiar with their racist past.¬†[""No Irish, no blacks, no dogs""](https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2024/05/06/no-irish-no-blacks-no-dogs-irish-times-readers-recall-encountering-notorious-signs-in-britain/)¬†used to be a common sign in Britain. You'd think this was all in the past, but as recently as 2017 we still had Britain' largest private¬†[buy-to-let landlord saying](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/28/landlord-fergus-wilson-said-coloured-people-leave-curry-smell): ""‚ÄúNo coloured people because of the curry smell at the end of the tenancy.‚Äù For clarity, the author does not explicitly comment on these incidents, I am commenting on it for context. \[I trust it won't be against the rules to quote racist comments verbatim, as it is clear I am criticising them in the harshest possible way\]

**In the other part, the author goes completely off the rails, and starts to generalise and to infer conclusions which do not stack up**. I don't want to spoil the book nor summarise all of it here, but one single example is very representative of what I mean. The author was discussing with a white, female French friend:

\[I had inserted it as a quote, reddit left it out, so I'm repeating it here, in italic, but without the quote formatting:

¬†*I told her about an experience of being passed over for a job I‚Äôd interviewed for and finding out through mutual friends that*¬†***the position had gone to a white woman***¬†***my age with almost identical experience to me***\*.¬†I had felt the slap in the face of¬†structural racism, the kind of thing you only hear about in statistics about black unemployment, but never hear about from the people affected by it. Then\*¬†***she said, ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt know if that was racism.¬†How do you know it wasn‚Äôt something else?‚Äô***

Of course this incident makes the author loses all hope, reinforcing her view that it's pointless to talk to white people about race, etc etc etc

Let's unpack this for a moment.

* She applies for a job.
* The interview, it is not said explicitly but can be inferred, goes reasonably well.
* However, the job goes to someone else: a woman (so no sexism), of the same age (so no ageism) with almost identical experience. Not someone unqualified, not the boss' niece, no: someone with almost identical experience.
* Is this enough to infer racism?

To be clear, what little the author says is not enough to rule out racism. But neither is it sufficient to infer it!!!

Maybe the hiring manager was racist. Maybe they didn't want any non-white people. Or maybe they simply preferred the other candidate for perfectly legitimate reasons which had nothing to do with racism. In the absence of any other information, who can know?

The experience of being passed over for a job by someone of very similar age and experience is an incredibly common one!

However, the problem with Enno-Lodge, and many activists like her, is that race is the only tool they have to interpret the world.¬†**When your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When your only interpretation lens is race, everything must be because of racism. Other interpretations cannot be possible.**

Her whole approach seems dishonest, because her arguments are framed in such a way that they are unfalsifiable. ""You don't get it, you're white, you have just proven my point"" seem to be the standard reply. I wonder what she would say to black people who dare disagree with her. Maybe that they have been brainwashed, proving the power of white racism and therefore proving, once again, their point?¬†[Amala Ekpunobi¬†](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhFdi1GHLwM&t=360s)comes to mind, but there are of course countless examples. (Note that the point is not on which topics Ekpunobi is right and the author wrong, but simply that other viewpoints are possible, including among black people).

Of course, falsifiability is a key criterion to deem a hypothesis scientific¬†https://philpapers.org/rec/BOWUNS#:\~:text=The%20unfalsifiability%20fallacy%20occurs%20when,for%20deeming%20a%20hypothesis%20scientific. Shame the author doesn't seem to be familiar with the concept.

Her approach doesn't simply fail to be conducive to dialogue, no, it's explicitly hostile to it. The whole undertone is: ""we are right, but they won't understand us"". So what? Give up any hope? Take power by force? Cry about your victimhood? What? It's unclear.

The underlying message that no single white person will ever be able to understand isn't just flawed - it's outright arrogant, racist and dangerous. Of course ""they"" don't understand because it's ""their"" fault, because not one person among ""them"" can ever understand what ""we"" went and go through, and if ""they"" disagree with ""us"", it's ""their"" fault - it cannot possibly be that even only one of the things ""we"" say may be wrong, incomplete or questionable - no, that's of course not possible.",normal
"I find it funny when a fiction writer is obsessively showing off how much research they did for a character. Sometimes, I'll be reading a novel, enjoying the narrative, and then the author will go off on a massive digression that is not entirely necessary to the book, where they just want to show me how much they learned while doing research for their character. I don't get mad about this. I usually find it endearing, and if they overdue it, I can just skim.

An example of this would be Ian McEwan's *Saturday*. The main character is a neurosurgeon. There are so many digressions in that book where McEwan is aggressively showing the reader how much he learned about the brain. Sometimes, it adds something important to the narrative or deepens the character. At other times, McEwan is just crowbarring in some interesting detail he learned.

This isn't a complaint or anything. It's just a kind of a sweet little thing I love about reading. Even in fiction, you're really just spending time with an author's mind--their preoccupations, their interests, their ego, their insecurities, their enthusiasm, their confusion etc.",normal

"Arthur C. Clarke's ""2061: Odyssey Three"". Tonight I've completed the second book of the Odyssey series just now which is ""2061: Odyssey Three"".

Here I again revisit Clarke's fantastic future with two space expeditions that have become completely entangled with human necessity and the laws of physics. And here the survivor of his two previous encounters with the monoliths Heywood Floyd must yet again confront David Bowman, or what was David Bowman, a newly independent Hal and the strange powers of an alien race that has now decided that humanity must play a part in the galaxy's evolution, whether it wants to or not.

Book number two, which now takes place a few decades later from the events of the second book, is pretty decent (seem to be using that one quite a bit!). It isn't as great as the previous two but I dug it anyhow. The feel here is a bit different, but not in a very big way to speak of. There is an adventure element in it that gives it a little more variety, which is pretty nice.

While there is a thread to the whole story but as it (as I'm also finding out) it jumps to a few years in the second and then in the third I've just finished, a few decades. Some people will find this annoying as they don't get any explanations as the series goes on, especially with the last two books in it. But I kind of find this as a minor annoyance, as I can still follow the thread of the story despite the jumps in the timeline.

For Clarke himself he never thought of ""2061"", or ""2010"", as linear sequels. He would describe them, in the author's note at the beginning of ""2061"", as variations on a theme with the same characters and situations and never happening in the same universe. That makes sense, but the thread's still there, even if it's not linear. And  now onto book three!",normal

"‚ÄúNight Watch‚Äù being made a Penguin Classic is so timely  ‚ÄúPeople on the side of The People always ended up disappointed, in any case. They found that The People tended not to be grateful or appreciative or forward-thinking or obedient. The People tended to be small-minded and conservative and not very clever and were even distrustful of cleverness. And so the children of the revolution were faced with the age-old problem: it wasn't that you had the wrong kind of government, which was obvious, but that you had the wrong kind of people.

As soon as you saw people as things to be measured, they didn't measure up. What would run through the streets soon enough wouldn't be a revolution or a riot. It'd be people who were frightened and panicking. It was what happened when the machinery of city life faltered, the wheels stopped turning and all the little rules broke down. And when that happened, humans were worse than sheep. Sheep just ran; they didn't try to bite the sheep next to them.‚Äù

"Just finished Tampa by Alyssa nutting I almost quit reading somewhere around the second or third chapter because it was so disturbing‚Ä¶ Not to mention, the main character is absolutely insufferable. But I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt. The further into the book I got, the more it cracked me up. Then I realized, it‚Äôs supposed to be satire. it actually reminded me a lot of American Psycho. Without the murder and gore. In Tampa, we are put into the mind of a 27-year-old female pedophile. Not only is she a pervert, but she is a complete and total self-centered narcissist. She‚Äôs beautiful and she knows it and she uses it to get what she wants. She becomes an eighth grade English teacher so that she can find a 14-year-old boy to begin grooming. She sets her sites on Jack Patrick, a sweet young boy who is totally sexually inexperienced. It‚Äôs probably one of the most disturbing books I have ever read. But I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm more disturbed about‚Ä¶ The fact that the book was ever written in the first place, or the fact that I actually kind of enjoyed reading it. Once I got past how utterly disgusting it was, I was actually able to appreciate the humor of it. Alyssa nutting is an awesome writer. The pros are fantastic, and the fact that she was able to portray a sociopath so well is pretty damn impressive. In my opinion. Has anyone else read this book? If so, what did you think of it?

"Poppy War and War Atrocities Sorry for a somewhat rambling post, but I finished Poppy War by RF Kuang last week and cannot get it out of my mind, not in a good way. (Mild spoilers that is implied in book blurb below)

For context, I‚Äôm East Asian who grew up in both the US and Asia, and have spent time learning about the Sino-Japanese War. To this day, the effect of the violence of comfort women is still felt, and being discussed. I understand that this book is ‚Äúinspired‚Äù or based on historical events, but borrowing in details of these war atrocities (Rape of Nanking, Unit 731 experiments, comfort women) in a fantasy novel feels almost exploitive, to have this pain used for entertainment. Especially for readers that don‚Äôt have as much context of the historical events and reading just as a secondary world fantasy without understanding this happened to actual people in real life. I am absolutely not comparing tragedies, but TJ Klune had been in the center of controversy (and rightfully so) for his book, The House in the Cerulean Sea for using genocide as inspiration (please read more on this, if you haven‚Äôt heard about this). And I feel like Poppy War has done the same thing without much discussion on it.

This is all to say, I‚Äôm curious where the line between using historical tragedies as inspiration and being exploitive is?

Edit to add: I‚Äòve only read the first book; and the main thing that really bothered me was how ‚Äúhistorically accurate‚Äú some of the events in Poppy War are even though it is a fantasy. Is it justified to use a scene by scene massacre for a novel?",normal
"I think I am going to ""Did Not Finish"" Mary Shelley's ""The Last Man."" Again... I like to go into books as blind as possible. The blurb I had seen for ""The Last Man"" by Mary Shelley is: ""The Last Man"" is an apocalyptic, dystopian science fiction novel by Mary Shelley, first published in 1826.

Based on the publication date, I knew it wouldn't be Stephen King or whatever, but I did expect some juicy stuff to happen. 

As I got through Volume One of this book, I started to think ""wait, this sounds familiar,"" and I realized that I must have started it once before, but I know I didn't finish it. 

Right now, I just finished volume one, about a week of heavy reading, and there's been no apocalypse, no supernatural or sci-fi elements... (well, one character did travel by hot-air balloon, so maybe that counts...)

Honestly, the writing is really really good. The story is pretty engaging, with the inner lives of the characters described in great detail, with beautiful language. Mary Shelley is an amazing writer, no doubt. 

I read ""Frankenstein,"" a while back, and I liked that a lot. I like how in the book the ""monster,"" talks in eloquent paragraphs, while in the movies he just goes ""uuuuugghhhhhh."" 

But I digress. I'm a pretty patient reader, and I'm not unfamiliar with slow-moving classics. I've read Moby Dick. Dox Quixote. Les Miserables. Crime and Punishment... All those kept me hooked.

I don't know why I'm making this post, exactly. I guess I want to ask y'all if I should push through with The Last Man, or let it go. I feel kind of embarrassed to DNF the same book twice... 

For me, classics can be hit or miss. Some of them feel so fresh, so relevant, so engaging. Others, for whatever reason, I can't get into.

Have y'all read ""The Last Man""? What do you think of it? Am I crazy in thinking that the build-up to whatever is going to happen is hella slow? But maybe now I am intrigued... I don't know...

"Why Reading Matters Something about this US election is making me want to encourage everyone to read more literature. I'm going to write down some things I've been thinking for years. I'm not sure if this will be of any use to anybody, but I figure it can't hurt to share. 

The point of reading is not just to learn stuff or be entertained. You will forget most of what you learn and most of what entertains you. Knowledge and entertainment are flimsy, fleeting things. They come. They go. And when they go, you will be left sitting in a chair, searching for the next distraction from the pain you're in. 

Reading is difficult because it requires you to make so many decisions. The whole time you read, you have to continuously decide to not stop reading. Then you have to decide what each word means. Then you have to decide how the meaning of that word relates to the rest of the words around it. Then you have to decide the purpose of each paragraph or stanza, and you have to figure out how it relates to all the other paragraphs or stanzas. Sometimes, when you can't figure out what something means, you have to accept your confusion and press on.

It's easier to just not read. It's easier to let a video wash over you. Here is why. Visual entertainment requires very little of you. If you stop thinking, the video keeps happening. You can passively receive it. If you stop reading, the story stops, too. With reading, you're completely in charge of the experience. Your brain is churning. You're working. It's tough. There is nothing passive about it. 

But the more you do it, the more your brain habituates that meaning-making mode. You start to interpret life actively. You naturally ask questions, piece things together, decide what makes sense, decide what doesn't. If you read enough, then your brain becomes inherently critical, which is the opposite of passive.

So even if you forget most of what you read, the practice of reading will make you harder to manipulate, since you will be used to doing the hard work of interpreting. The less you read, the easier you are to manipulate, since your brain gets accustomed to being a passive receptacle of images and information. You simply don't have to work as hard to consume a video than you do when you consume written language, and the hard work of reading is exactly the thing that will keep your mind potent, independent, critical, and growing.

But a more critical mind is not the main reason I'm encouraging you to keep reading during this era of endless entertainment. I'm encouraging you to keep reading because you are sometimes going to feel brutally, severely alone. And when writers use language to try to capture what it feels like to be alive, you can catch a glimpse of yourself in their language, and you can realize, in a really powerful way, that others have felt just as alone as you are feeling, and you can connect with those writers across time and space, and you can be together with them in your aloneness.

There is a reason that the dictators always burn and ban literature. When people read literature, they encounter the human experience in a uniquely intimate way. The reader envisions what it is like to be inside another body, since the language within a book emerged from within another body, the author's body. And when people do this regularly, they develop a deep empathy. Empathetic people do not want to fall in line with violent leaders. They do not want to be manipulated into hurting people. They understand that every human life is as potent and vivid as their own.

So keep reading. Your brain will work better. And you will be harder to manipulate. And you will be less alone. ",normal
"""Incidents Around the House"" - I Am So Mad! I JUST finished Josh Malerman's ""Incidents Around the House"", and man, did that ending SUCK. Poor little Bella went through so much crap, just for it all to be completely useless in the end.

The character of the mother made me sick. Her selfish, disgusting behavior. Everything she did that hurt her child. I understand her reasoning was a main plot of the novel, but it was all still so WRONG. I didn't expect the book to end the way it did. It was so sudden, I had to go back and check, just to make sure I hadn't accidentally skipped something.

"Which Book Left You Absolutely Stunned?  There are some books that are so well-written and unpredictable that they leave you completely stunned, with that feeling of wanting to talk to someone about it immediately. For me, that book was *The Silent Patient* by Alex Michaelides. From the beginning, I was fascinated by Alicia‚Äôs character‚Äîher silence after her husband‚Äôs murder and the psychological unraveling around why she wouldn‚Äôt speak a word. Theo, the psychologist who becomes obsessed with her case, seemed like the one who would finally reveal the truth, but every new piece of information just added to the suspense. The twists and turns completely blindsided me, and by the end, I just had to sit there and take it all in. The way it left me feeling a little incomplete but deeply engaged really stuck with me. The revelation about Theo‚Äôs connection to Alicia‚Äôs story absolutely blindsided me, and it made me question everything I‚Äôd read up until that point. I had to re read the last few chapters again to make sense of what was happening. It left me wanting more details and closure. For me, it was the only psychological thriller that left me so stunned that I didn't understand for some time how could all this happen.

"Why do you think Murakami references brands by name every chance he gets? Murakami never says things like ""He pulled out a cigarette"", ""He poured himself a soda"" or ""we drove past a few burger joints"". He always says ""He pulled out a Marlboro"", ""He poured himself a Perrier"" and ""we drove past a few McDonalds"". In Kafka on the Shore, >!mascots become real characters who drive the plot like Johnnie Walker and the KFC Colonel!<. I've heard people say that it's some kind of critique of consumerism and Japan's loss of soul but to me at least it does not feel critical, it just feels acknowledged. If anything it sometimes feels elevated in a Warholian still-life sort of way. I'm not sure why he does that myself, but the effect it has on me as a reader is that it blurs the line between the book's universe and my universe. It's rare for books or movies to dwell so much on real brands so when it does happen it really anchors the universe to our reality and our everyday experience, which makes the bizare stuff that happens in his books feel more real. I remember watching a movie called ""Escape from Tomorrow"" (2013) which was filmed guerilla-style in Disneyland and there was a scene where >!the main character is tied up on a bed inside a spooky lab and is being experimented on by an android. The scene is generally pretty goofy and stereotypical but the fact that the lab is located inside a real attraction in Disneyland and that the android and the lab machines both have a large SIEMENS logo on them makes it really bizarre for me. It really felt like I was seeing real found footage from some kind of weird corporate conspiracy!<. Murakami's books produce a similar effect. But that's just me, what do you think?",normal

"What are some things that prevent you a little from enjoying a book? At what point will they stop you from reading?  There are things that prevent me from enjoying a book but will not stop me unless they keep recurring or become extreme. I will give you an example.

One is the various isms (racism, sexism, and the like). I think I have become desensitized to them from having read too many older books that were written at a time when these bigoted attitudes were the norm and many people were not aware of the damage that these stereotypical views caused. 

So now if I'm reading a contemporary crime novel and the detective is a bit of a macho guy and sexist, I continue reading, though feeling a little annoyed. But if I find that the detective is actually what the author believes and that the author is kind of hiding behind the character but has an agenda, I will stop.

What are some things that reduce your enjoyment but will not stop you from reading? And when do they become too much?

Can be about the plot, characters, and theme, but also the actual writing (vocabulary, grammar, dialect).",normal

"How do you feel about authors continuing another author‚Äôs work after they‚Äôre gone?  This is a question that I had been thinking about lately and have been talking about with some friends of mine, so I thought I‚Äôd continue the conversation. 

I was recently reading Eruption, a novel that Michael Crichton started writing but was left unfinished at the time of his death. Years later, Crichton‚Äôs widow enlisted James Patterson to complete the book. 

That got me thinking of other instances where an author died and left a story unfinished (Charles Dickens, Robert E. Howard, V.C. Andrews, Robert B. Parker, just to name a few) and somebody came in and finished their story, trying to capture the same ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of the original author. 

The results (at least to me) mostly fall short, the work in question coming off as a disjointed mess. 

Or when an author will write a popular book series and then die and then the estate will hire another author to write new books in the series. I understand the desire to want to tell new stories in that narrative world and to not let the characters die, but much of the time the results come off like cheap fanfiction. 

However, there are to me those rare instances where it actually works but I‚Äôm curious to know what your thoughts are. ",normal
"My gripe about feminist critiques of Twilight/Stephanie Meyer.  As the original reader base of the Twilight series is likely in their 30s now, there is surprisingly no shortage of content being made about the books on social media and I am honestly sick of how admonishing and critical is. 

The critiques are largely about how it's so appalingly sexist and absurd, yet relish in the content to an obsessive degree. There are whole accounts just about deconstructing her work.

- ""She's Mormon, the books are trash because it's all Mormon coded"" 
- ""She hates women so much""
- ""These ideas are in her books, so they must be in her brain"" 


I genuinely think the people psycologizing Stephanie Meyer, yet devouring her work are more woman hating. 
They say ""The Host doesn't have these issues, I wonder what changed"" (direct quote). 
The Host is a great example, the writing is NOT actually better or different than Twilight. 

She was writing based on her lived experience and from her worldview, she always was. Not every woman is a sexually liberated feminist as a teen girl. Why are they asking that of her - retroactively at that?
The books are practically smut, it's erotica for teenage girls. 
No one is talking about how it must be so depraved, psychopathic, and misogynistic it must be in Cormac McCarthy's mind. No one's saying he must be a serial killer. No one cares because he's a man. 

Everyone loves to pick apart female authors, when men write detestable things beautifully, it's so disgusting to me.  

They do it with Diana Gabaldon too. 
""She is so obsessed with nipples and breast feeding, I bet that she's projecting the kink she wants from her husband into her work. It makes me sooo uncomfortable to read that, it's in every book, I can't escape it."" On the same coin, read every Outlander book 3 times and watched the series 5 times. 

What if, we just let women authors be the same way we let male authors be? 
Why are all the critiques about modern literature only ever about sexual themes, never about true  violence? 
Why is it so gross that two characters desire each other sexually when it's not labeled in a specific way, but if two characters cut 100 men into tiny pieces it's just cool? 

People always complain about sexual assault and adult themes in books, yet buy all the books that contain edgy content and lap them up. 
Read a different genre? 

The only male sex related literary critiques I've ever heard are about IT and Lolita. And many women will come to the rescue of Nabakov immediately, I never see men defend him. 
The most hear about King is that his choices in it were strange and unsettling and he regrets it. 
Then it's back to ripping Meyer to literal shreds. 
And reading books about semi consensual cannibalism, but that's fine because written by a man. Lol. 

If you find Twilight distasteful, move on from it. 
Stop stewing in it. You grew out of it, like everyone else, right? Or do you still secretly love it and the only way to have proximity to it is to make character assassinations on its author in an echochamber and get back pats from all the other mature ladies who moved on to beastality and own multiple centaur smut books on kindle...
In between rankings about how absurd Edward Cullen's genitalia is and laughing about the sound it makes when imaginary vampires kiss. 

You're  hypocrites. Stop beating a dead horse. 
They aren't great books, leave that poor woman alone and stop consuming what you supposedly  hate so much. 
Stephanie Meyer is a real person with a real life and a family. Imagine how crushing it is as a creative mind to have your fans drag you through the mud until the end of time. The same people who begged you for more.. 

Just so weird. 

I can understand critiquing the work, not when guilded in fanatacism but okay, but the relentless mean girl judging of the author and digging into their personal lives, trying to diagnose them and shame them for the work they produced in some long past chapter of their lives, is so inappropriate. These are living women. 
If you don't do it to the graphic male authors, don't do it to the female authors. 

Also I believe we should be able to thoughtfully explore graphic concepts in writing. Readers calling for censorship in the genres they love to read is crazy to me. We are so desensitized to violence we think it's more disgusting for a *character* to have non politically correct, non violent thoughts than it is for a *character* to slaughter people. 

What is that about? 
I would think that if you can't swallow unsavory scenes you would be particularly outraged by literal torture. Instead it's the actual villains that attract women. It reminds me of the people who form intimate relationships with serial killers behind bars, even marry them. 

Just so twisted, that instead of taking the work at face value, we unequally judge things. Evil is okay, but traditional values are not.

"What‚Äôs the most disturbing book you‚Äôve ever read? Actually, let me rephrase that‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs the most disturbing book you‚Äôve ever managed to get through? Because I don‚Äôt mean disturbing like, ‚Äúdamn‚Ä¶ This is kind of messed up‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äô I mean disturbing like, ‚Äúthis is so fucked up that I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to finish it.‚Äô‚Äô The word disturbing can take on several different meanings. So you can interpret it however you‚Äôd like. But, to me, disturbing is something that either disgusts you, triggers you, makes you so angry that you want to cry, or rips your heart out in a way that makes you wanna launch the book across the room. But it‚Äôs almost as if there is some type of gravitational pull keeping your eyes glued to the pages.  

I‚Äôm 31 years old and have been reading since I was a child. I have come across very few books that have actually managed to disturb me. The first book I ever read that I found to be slightly disturbing was the lovely bones by Alice Sebold. I read it when I was only 16 years old, so, back then, it was pretty messed up. It became one of my favorite books of all time though, hands-down,. Now that I am an adult, I think two of the most disturbing books I have ever read are Tampa by Alyssa nutting and My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell.  

I‚Äôm only halfway through Tampa right now and honestly, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm gonna be able to finish it. The protagonist is, without a doubt, the most sociopathic MC I have ever come across.  

My Dark Vanessa, however, is one of the most disturbing, yet beautifully heart wrenching portrayals of trauma that I have ever read in my life. I would almost bet money that Kate Elizabeth Russell has been through something similar herself. Otherwise, I don‚Äôt see any way she would be able to capture it so brilliantly. In my opinion, it truly is a literary masterpiece.

"Flowers in the Attic Questions and Discussion I know there's previous posts on this book, but I got obsessed with it üòÖ

I found it so incredibly amazing, even though it really wasn't that great of a book. Plus the foreword completely spoiled it.

But holy shit, I really like that book. I really do. There's so many aspects that make it as good as it is.

The biggest one is that the kids are confined, but they're not necessarily forced to be there. They weren't kidnapped - they were tricked and lied to. As Chris and Cathy showed, they could've left at any time. Or at least a lot earlier than they did. (I'm sure they could've managed with the twins.)

That's the part that really gets me. I'm not blaming the children for their suffering, but I think it's wild that they REALLY could've left at any time after figuring out a way down. 

It was more of a psychological jail imo. Staying because they're under a delusion that they'll share their mother's inheritance 

Another part is that I think the section of my job is about as big as the attic would've been, and I think about how nuts it would be to stay there for three years. Since I have a personal reference, it makes the story more bewildering.

And the idea of there being children you don't know about in a house is so unsettling too üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

Corrine's character development was CRAZY. Because I'm sure she truly loved her late husband and family (because why would she initially give up her inheritance?), but as we can see from the first few chapters, she was planning on keeping the kids in the attic indefinitely.

Also, Bart.

But how could she do that??? I thought she genuinely loved those kids, and she never knew Christopher was going to die. So, if he didn't die, they'd just keep living the way they did?

After I finished the book, I kept having questions like that. Why did x happen/not happen? Why didn't something happen instead?

But it doesnt seem like one of those stories when there's a big plot hole; it seems like there could always be a reasonable explanation.

More Questions:

‚Ä¢ What did you think of Chris?

Personally, I thought he was annoying as hell, but I still like him. He was the main reason the kids didn't escape earlier. No good mother would be comfortable locking their kids in a room for even a few hours. So, after the first few days/weeks passed...He really should've caught on.

‚Ä¢ Why didn't Corrine put the kids in boarding school or foster care?

‚Ä¢ Why couldn't the kids find some agency/charity/organization to help them after they got out? I'm not sure why they decided to steal money instead.",normal

"Pocahontas and the English Boys, by Karen Kupperman The subtitle of this one is ""Caught between cultures in early Virginia.""  

Man.  What a book.  I haven't been this impressed with the scholarship level of a book since I read David Hackett Fischer's book Paul Revere's Ride, published in 1994.  The book - Pocahontas and the English Boys - basically took my brain, as far as anything was in it regarding early Virginia, and turned it inside out and gave it a good wash and a vigorous scrub.

I was trying to learn about slavery in early Virginia.  Why on earth did George Yeardley purchase those ""20. and Odd Negroes"" in 1619?  What did he think he was doing?  I emailed a well respected historian and haven't heard back.  Maybe it went straight to his spam folder, who knows.  And I did not learn much from this book about slavery in early Virginia.  As far as I could tell, slavery wasn't a part of any of these people's conceptions of the world between 1607 and 1617, which is basically when the book ends.

Although other sources claim that after John Smith left what was to become New England, in 1614, the ship commander he left behind promptly seized two dozen Indians and sold them as slaves in Spain.  Spain, of course, had been into the slave trade for much longer than England, and had made a LOT of money off it.

But anyway.  Did you know that in the 17th century, it was common for British sub-teenagers to be apprenticed out?  Now you know.  Apparently parents feared that their too strong attachments, to their kids, would prevent them from exercising the kind of discipline the kids really needed.  And it happened again and again that the Virginia colonists took youngsters of 11, 12, 13 years old and sent them off to live with the Indians.  Not to apprentice them out but so the Indians would raise them knowing the Indian languages, so that they would then be able to come back and help the colonists deal with the Indians.

And so the book basically follows the careers of some of these teenagers - and Pocahontas too, she was 10 years old when she was sent to live with the colonists for a little while.  The marriage with John Smith was all hocus, more of a kind of ""adoption"" of Smith into the Powhatan tribe.  Although her marriage with John Rolfe, later, was apparently real.

And tobacco!  I knew, as who did not, that tobacco was important in Virginia.  But no one ever told me before that tobacco was the whole reason the colony thrived, and the only thriving any of the colonies did for quite some time.  It was the discovery that tobacco could be produced much more cheaply in Virginia - not using slave labor yet, they hadn't started yet - and sold to the masses in Europe, that made the colonies a paying proposition for their backers in England.  Virginia tobacco, in the early 1600s (1619 to 1622) created a sensation in Europe.  People for whom tobacco had always been an unimaginable luxury suddenly could afford it, and found that they wanted to.  And that was what really got the colonies going.

And apparently - according to the book - it was the Indians that showed the British how to grow and cure tobacco!  It's not so easy.  You don't just throw a couple of seeds in the earth and hold your breath while they grow.  The Indians apparently took some care and some trouble to educate the British on just how it was done.

Unfortunately, the new tobacco craze inspired more and more and more to come to the colony.  They were planting tobacco in the streets of Jamestown.  And the massive influx of colonists, of course, demanded more and more land, and land wasn't quite as easy to come by as our high school history books implied.  There were Indians already on the land, and they had borders, and border conflicts, and power struggles just as the Europeans had.

Well, there's more - lots more - but it's all interesting.  Highly recommended.",normal
"The Midnight Library was not the best...but it wasn't the worst either When I was younger (say 12-13 years old) I had read ""A Boy called Christmas"" by Matt Haig. Since then it has become one of my most beloved books and I have read it many times. One year ago I noticed that another book by the same author was gaining more popularity and that was none other than The Midnight Library. I was intrigued by the plot and the mixed reviews and I decided to keep an eye on it for the future. Last Christmas my sister gifted it to me but due to high school exams, I wasn't able to read it - until now.

I'll start by saying that although the book did not meet all of my expectations, I was not disappointed. Truth be said, I expected to like it more than I did but it didn't leave a bad taste on me once I was done reading it. Is it overhyped. Most likely yes? Did I enjoy it? Also yes. I think that it's good that I read it now, because had I read it sooner, when my excitement over it was higher, I would be more disappointed.

From the very first pages, I was hooked by the plot. We get to see Nora's life, how miserable she feels and how she has given up on life. Once Nora enters the midnight library after she attempts to kill herself, we witness her journey to find the perfect life for her. She is not alone. In the library she finds Mrs Elm, the old librarian from her old school. With her help she tries to navigate through the millions possible lives she could live in. But what is the best way to live?

I found the concept of the book very imaginative. I haven't read any books like this before and the system was very unique too. Just imagine how interesting it would be if we had the opportunity to travel to all of the different lives we might have lived! How different our path would be if we did even the smallest change in our life. Matt Haig did a good job crafting this magic system and for the most part, I enjoyed following Nora in her different paths.

The book did a good job exploring Nora's regrets and sadness. At the beginning it's clear that Nora is suffocated by her guilt and desperation. She regrets the things she did and the things she didn't do. She feels like she has wasted her life and isolated by almost everyone, she doesn't find a reason to live anymore. Her past haunts her continuously and in the library, she finds the chance to undo her mistakes and live her life differently. However, she quickly realises that what sounded so wonderful in her head was not what she made it out to be. Most of her biggest regrets were because she didn't get to fullfil other people's wishes. Her father's dream to see her become a great competitive swimmer. Her ex-fiance's dream to open a pub in the country. Her brother's dream to become a famous musician. And the list goes on.

Throughout her life, Nora was focused on trying to please the people around her. The dreams she didn't get to fullfil were never her own. Of course she found enjoyment in some things, like studying philosophy, playing music or swimming. But most of her goals were guided by others' desires. She never got to have her own ambitions. Instead of following her own path, she tries to live up to the expectations of others - and ultimately fail. But that changes as she travels in her other lives. She accepts that she can't undo her past. She accepts her own regrets. And she finally finds enjoyment in living. She doesn't seek death and she wants to live instead. But there is one question: what could her best possible live be?

For the most part, I enjoyed reading about the different lives of Nora. It was interesting to see how different the outcome would be had she made different decisions. Although I didn't fully connect with Nora, I felt sympathy for her, especially at the beginning. I could understand her frustation and worries and I really wanted her to find the best life. I also enjoyed seeing her growth and how she came to appreciate herself and value.

The writing was good. It was simple and at times, it was quite lyrical. Some parts made me laugh, some made me angry and some others made me sad. There were many quotes that resonated with me and made me pause and rethink about my choices and life. In some parts, the book felt bittersweet and overall, it brought me comfort while reading it. It was cheesy, I know. But I still enjoyed it.

I appreciated the theme around the ""meaning"" of life and how we define success. By pursuing success and by being driven by egoistical motives, we start to lose ourselves. We are trying to give a meaning to our lives, to find our purpose in this world and by doing so, we're starting to stop appreciating life for what it is. We are not able to see the forest for the trees and we underestimate the importance of the little things that are making as feel happy and content. And as the book says:

>*Never underestimate the importance of small things.*

There have been times in my life when I too have felt remorse for some of the things I have or haven't done. I have felt remorse for getting a bad grade when I knew I could study more and do better. I have felt remorse for fighting with my sister over something insignificant. I have felt remorse for saying bad things to my mom during a heated argument. True, compared to Nora or other people's regrets, mine may seem unimportant. But at the time, they still made me feel bad and I wished I could change them. However, as time went on, I have come to accept that I can't change the past. What I should do instead is try to develop more as a person and live my life in the fullest. It sounds cliche. I know. But it's something which is worth to remember. It's pointless to try and change our past decisions, no matter how we feel about them. What we can do is learn from our mistakes and try to fix them. Yes life can be bleak. And it's not going to be easy to just get over our hardships. But there is a possibility of a better future, if we manage to take matters in our own hands. To seize our own day.

As much as I enjoyed reading the book, as I already mentioned above, it wasn't exactly what I expected. This is one of the cases when the author has a good idea but the execution is lackluster. The concept of the book was very good and unique. It could be better, though. At one point, the plot became quite repetitive. Nora's lives followed the same structure and during the middle of the novel, they became quite predictable and monotonous. I still had fun while reading them but I was quite close at skimming some parts. I think that it would have been nice if we had more chapters like the first ones, before Nora entered the library. There was much telling and not showing when it came to her past and the relationship with her family and while that was not necessarily bad, it would have been more effective if they were presented in a different way. 

The plot would have definitely benefitted from more action, especially during the middle. Although the book was fast-paced, at one point I stopped caring a little because I knew that nothing remarkable would happen. The plot twists in Nora's lives lost their charm and the story was going around in circles. I would have prefered it if the book had focused in fewer lives and if some themes had been explored more.

The characterisation in this book was quite bland. The only character I got to know better was of course Nora but even she wasn't that fleshed out. Of course the book describes her worries, her struggles with her mental health, her developement. I sympathised with her, I felt proud of her developement but overall, I didn't have strong feelings about her as a person. She was read like a shell of a person at times. She would live a different life, realize that she didn't like it, have a short conversation with Mrs Elm and conclude that she had been wrong about what would be the best for her. Her journey to self reflection could have been handled better and she could have. As for the rest of the characters...well, they were kinda forgettable. Mrs. Elm was the typical type of character who is there to give advices to the main characters and be a mentor to them. And I couldn't bring myself to care for the rest of the others.

When it came to the writing, although it was good, it became kinda corny with all of these deep and intellectual quotes. I understand what Haig's goal was and as I already said, many of them made me think a lot. But they could have been toned out. At one point, I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again and despite the warm feelings it caused me, it was quite boring and surface-level. 

Despite my criticism of the novel, I still found it enjoyable and thought-provoking. The ending made me cry a little and I finished the book with a smile on my face. Granted, it was not the best book I've ever read but it was okay and I by no means regret reading it. It was a very cozy autumn read and I could see myself revisiting it in the future if I wanted to read something light-hearted and easy-going. I wouldn't recommend it as a life-changing read but I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it. After all, books are unpredictable. You don't know what you will like unless you'll try it. Just like most of the things we're doing in our life.

So, The Midnight Library didn't change my mindset. But it made me re-value my life and it encouraged me to continue to live in the best way I can. I might not now what is going to happen tomorrow, in one week or in a few years. But one thing is certain:

I'm going to try and live every minute of it.",normal

"Industry reluctance/inability to offer a complete digital experience with books as a medium  I'm new here so I hope this meets the subs standards for posting.

Going right into it, seeing the post about ""Report finds ‚Äòshocking and dispiriting‚Äô fall in children reading for pleasure"" it made me want to voice a bit of my own frustrations with attempting to re-engage with reading. I used to actively read multiple books a week as a kid growing up throughout my primary education up until I graduated Highschool.

Then I pretty much had to immediately join the workforce afterwards. This put my free time to read at a limit, and my interaction with a place where books would be readily available or encouraged to read at a minimum.

Despite engaging with daily reading material, News Articles, published research papers and consistently taking a wealth of written knowledge thanks to the rising increased usage of the internet in the encroaching digital era my reading stamina for longer form content was shot after a decade of just not reading books outside of the occasional gift or recommendation.

The last year, year and a half I wanted to start prioritizing reading more, and so I went back and reread some of my favorites, and some new books that I found interesting. Something that helped me pick up that reading stamina and stay engaged despite the countless other forms of entertainment/distractions was Audiobooks.

Specifically reading alongside audiobooks, I could engage with the material despite being exhausted after work, and even used it when relaxing, be it reading along with the material as the audiobook is going, turning the audio book off and reading myself to a specific chapter and picking the audiobook back up when I get tired of reading, It just made it a more engaging, less intimidating experience to get back into, but the problem with it is the system for digital books is not set up at all to help encourage or support utilizing the features like this. The only thing I found that offers support for this is the android Amazon app on a mobile phone, in which the Kindle app can detect if you own an audible book and actually follow along word for word with the audiobook. However the official kindle devices don't even support this feature now, and it's unlikely to see continued support.

Why I bring this up with the first part of this post ""Report finds ‚Äòshocking and dispiriting‚Äô fall in children reading for pleasure"" is because for other popular media sources, Films, Movies, Television, Videogames, even certain YouTube creators, you all have subtitles alongside the visual experience, and the audio experience.  It utilizes all the senses, you can put a movie in on the background, if you don't understand something you can look over read the subtitles and pick up on it, and that already has other sensory context clues to engage the one interacting with it.

For popular releases, and really anything with audiobooks it's a shame the medium isn't set up in way that marriages the reading and listening experiences together so you can control the pace at which you're either listening, or actively reading and engaging with the text. Both are mentally stimulating in some ways, and for some fiction books that utilize a lot of fantasy language, or text it just plain doesn't make sense that someone who has the audiobook can't have access to the resources that explain the text. There are also some books that utilize 4th wall notations in the columns of the books, or author notes that don't get translated into the audiobook.

For business, contractual and monetization purposes they separate books entirely from it's oral renditions, as there is more money to be made in selling them as separate products, but I think that really hurts the media as a whole from an accessibility standpoint, when other media forms have to by default include more interactivity and stimulation of multiple senses.

Tl;DR Just from an accessibility standpoint I think if they want to continue growth in readers in younger generations, or even just even encourage those who used to reads to pick back up the hobby, they need to find a way to make engaging with reading as simple as opening up a streaming service, or playing a dialogue heavy RPG for the average consumer, and I think offering a platform that combined E-Books with Audiobooks in a simple way cross-platform would absolutely be a push in the right direction. Something you can pick up mute and read on the go, or pause put on speakers close your eyes and listen to at home, or just follow along with by just bookmarking where you previously left off reading would go a long way to help make the hobby more open to all while embracing the new digital format for a millennia old medium.",normal
"How to get over book disappointment? Since booktok has blown up, even though I don't use tiktok, I'm hearing about all these amazing booktok books.

I finally caved and decided to read one.

It was disappointing to say the least. Nothing really fit in the book and it was messy. 

Book disappointment is what stopped me reading in the past, so I'm wondering how everyone else gets over bad books.


And, how to find actually good books. Booktok has failed me a few to many times now.


Edit: thank you for all the recommendations on where to find new books! Sadly, I don't have anyone in my life who reads like I do. They will read 1-2 books a year, maybe. I can read 4-5 a week.

Hopefully some of the subreddits suggested will be able to help!",normal
"Have you ever taken a library book on vacation with you? I went back and forth about it before I went on a trip last month. I didn't want to lose it or risk damaging it. But I was in the middle of the book and didn't want to have to wait so long before continuing it. 

I grabbed the book at the last minute and I'm glad I did. I wound up reading some of it several evenings and it made a nice memory. Nothing bad happened to the book, and on the contrary, it came in handy. I pressed a leaf in it and brought it home as a souvenir!

Has anyone else taken a walk on the wild side and brought a library book on vacation with you?",normal
"Dune Just finished Dune, the first book. I have had it on my list of ""to read"" since a long time ago. I had seen the movies, not the series, so somewhat of a spoiler there.

I thought it was mostly an easy read, with a bit of over explaining on some points and others just throws you into the scene with no advanced warning (beginning fo chapters).

I enjoyed the book overall, although I found the ending of the first book somewhat of a letdown. I think there should have been a bit more to it. My opinion only, but wanted to share it, as I've been getting into reading again in my old age from when I was a teenager. ",normal
"The Great Gatsby, why make highschoolers read this? I (35M) recently re-read this because a high-schooler I knew was forced to read it. I read this in high school.

I thought there was so much historical information that couldn't be appreciated by a young person unless they are hyper-focused on this specific era.

It also feels like this book glorifies things like infidelity, strong alcohol use, lying, etc. It brought me back to the days when I was drinking heavily. (Thankfully I'm sober now.)

There is some nice, flowery language, and there is a good vibe about the whole book. I enjoyed it. I feel there's got to be much better books to force children to read in high school.",normal
"What is magical realism? I have a theory that books fall on a spectrum of magical realism instead of just being an either or situation. I‚Äôve been very interested in this genre of books for a while now but I‚Äôve only been able to read just one or two books in that category. This is because of how challenging it is to truly grasp books with magical realism. It‚Äôs such a unique art form to be able bridge the normal and abnormal and I will always appreciate that. I realised that it can be so ambiguous to define magical realism though. For example, while many people view Babel as fantasy, I think it‚Äôs magical realism (having that perspective made me enjoy the book more tbh). I have always thought of The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka as magical realism as well as Before The Coffee gets cold. Even The Secret History had hints of magical realism. i think my idea of magical realism is quite broad. But that‚Äôs why I want to know, when does a book leave the sci-fi and fantasy realm and become magical realism? Of course I can google this, but I also want to have a discussion on this, plus google‚Äôs answers aren‚Äôt very satisfactory

edit: typos

edit: Babel isn‚Äôt magical realism",normal

"I'm convinced Stephen King doesn't know anything about kids/teens anymore I'll preface by saying I'm a guy nearing 40, but I just finished listening to Under the Dome. I enjoyed it for the most part, but throughout I became more and more convinced King just can't write relatable kid/teen characters anymore. Some might argue that he's always had trouble (infamous IT scene as a glaring example), but after so many 1930-50s-type references coming from kids' mouths I just started rolling my eyes.

One kid makes a ""this is another nice mess you got me in,"" jab at another like it's something people do every day, which is from 1930s Laurel and Hardy. Another instance has a teen casually saying something like, ""like Lon Chaney dancing with the Queen,"" either from the 1941 The Wolf Man movie or more likely the 1970s Werewolves of London song.

Maybe I'm wrong, but do kids and teens know Laurel and Hardy references? Was The Wolf Man or Waren Zevon still on some people's radar like it's second nature when Obama was president (which is when the book takes place)?

Just wanted to rant, because it's the biggest thing that kept taking me out of the story to Google references to understand where these kids got their lingo.",normal

"I read a paranormal romance series about mermaids that got way more intense than I thought it would. So one of my secret interests is mermaids and I recently stumbled upon a long running mermaid romance series of books called ""Merman's Kiss"" on Kindle. (Just for clarity since there are two books with the same name, I'm talking about the series by Dee. J Stone)

It's a pretty long series. The first book came out in 2014 and from what I can tell, it's still going on to this day, with multiple spin offs and the latest book in the series released last January.

So I decided, wanting a nice mermaid book to read to try going into the series.

The first book was mostly what I expected. A nice simple romance piece with the conflict coming from mostly character drama. It's pretty clich√© but in that endearing way you can't help but like.

Then I read the second book. The stakes escalated a bit, especially with a major moment of mood whiplash, but other than that it seemed pretty standard.

And then the third book happened. And that's the point where the story went off the rails. In a good way.

I don't wanna spoil it but there's a major plot twist during the third book involving the main girl's father and MAN things get intense and crazy after that. Complete with heartbreaking results in the fourth book.

I know I'm being very unspecific here, but that's just because I don't wanna risk spoiling it. Because it really is best if you go in blind. Maybe it was just me but the whole book kept me so on the edge of my seat, that I couldn't stay in. I was walking and pacing while reading from my kindle the whole time. I couldn't take my eyes off it.

I'm aware paranormal romance isn't everyone thing, and it does get a little sickening sweethearts at times (It doesn't get explicit but there's a *lot* of focus on the two leads make out sessions when they can) but if you don't mind a little spice and thriller in your romance, maybe give this series a shot.",normal
"How do you guys feel about unreliable narrators?? Personally, I have mixed emotions about them. In some cases, the author can make it work. For example: Gone Girl by Jillian Flynn. The diary entries were a great way to pull it off. She meant for the diary to be found, which is why she was pretending to be something she wasn‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs something like that, it tends to work well. Letters to another person, or if something happened to make the narrator unreliable. A mental illness or a head injury for instance. What I don‚Äôt like, however, is when they are unreliable for absolutely no reason at all. Like, when the ending comes, and it‚Äôs completely unbelievable because the narrator has been one person throughout the entire book all the way up until the end and then they have a complete personality switch out of nowhere. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. One book that does this is You Shouldn‚Äôt Have Come Here by Geneva Rose. It‚Äôs written in the style of Gone Girl. The book switches back-and-forth between the perspectives of two different narrators, male/female. We are put into the minds of both individuals throughout the book, then at the end, the unexpected twist comes, and suddenly they are no longer who we thought they were at all. But there‚Äôs no reason for the random personality  shift whatsoever. it comes totally out of nowhere and is just extremely unbelievable/unrealistic. It‚Äôs almost as if the author were in a hurry to finish the book, and just completely changed her characters into totally different people and scribble down some random ending for the sake of finishing the book. There‚Äôs no foreshadowing or any type of clues leading up to the twist at all. I don‚Äôt like this. It left me with a lot of confusion and unanswered questions. How do you guys feel about unreliable narrators? In your opinion, when do they work and when do they not? Feel free to provide examples for both. Books where the author makes it work, and books where they don‚Äôt.  

Note: I only ask to provide examples so that I can see what your idea of a good unreliable narrator is versus a bad one. That is not a recommendation/suggestion request. Examples are not necessary. I would just like to know how y‚Äôall feel about unreliable narrators in general. I hope this post doesn‚Äôt get removed because of the last sentence!!  

Edit: after another person mentioned it in the comments below, I would like to add that another type of unreliable narrator I happen to enjoy is one that has a distorted view of reality for some reason. For instance: they are extremely immature or self-centered, they are paranoid, they are being gaslighted by someone important to them, etc. One major example I can think of is My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell. The teenage protagonist, Vanessa, is being gaslighted by her teacher who is 27 years older than her. She is so traumatized and blinded by his gaslighting that she thinks they are in love. She doesn‚Äôt realize that he is a predator who has groomed her to fall in love with him. she is so unreliable, in fact, that we as the reader actually believe it‚Äôs love as well until we start to see the truth about midway through the book. Sadly, though, Vanessa doesn‚Äôt realize it until the end.",normal
"With the elections only a few days away, what are your favorite political fiction/nonfiction books? I'm using the word political very loosely so don't look for books that are strictly about politics. It's fine as long as it has something to do with government, social power and status (e.g., racism, sexism), distribution of money or other resources (e.g., poverty), war and terror, and things like that. 

You can mention nonfiction too but here's a list of political thrillers:

For me, I'll go with nonfiction. A favorite of mine is The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Didn't really know much about him at all before a friend urged me to a read it. Reading the book you get to know him and watch his gradual transformation. You get to see how this contentious figure came to be who he is. The narration is so fascinating and well-written.

"Why there is so much (sudden) death in contemporary fiction?  I just finished ‚ÄòHello Beautiful‚Äô by Ann Napolitano, and whereas I found this book exceptionally beautiful and well-written (and myself sobbing endlessly throughout the last 30 pages), I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder: why there is death everywhere nowadays when it comes to fiction? I mean, I *know* death is inevitable part of our existence but it feels like sudden death of a character is a thing often used in contemporary fiction. I mean, from some point at the beginning I already knew one of the sisters would die unexpectedly (once again, I KNOW it‚Äôs an homage to Little Women and it was mentioned in the book), but it‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôm encountering this. 

What are your thoughts on this? Do you think it‚Äôs made just for the sake of making readers ‚Äòfeel more‚Äô? Maybe happy endings are a cliche nowadays already?",normal
"Just finished ‚ÄúWar‚Äù by Bob Woodward I‚Äôm not generally a political reader, but Woodward really did a great job here. I was most impressed with his simple wording when describing complex topics. And the characters felt real and well-rounded, even though they are obviously real people.

Overall, I was so impressed that I may start reading some of his other works. War did not feel academic at all; it was just a page-turner.

Would love to hear the thoughts of others on this one.",normal
"The space trilogy  Well I just finished CS Lewis‚Äô Space Trilogy and I‚Äôm gonna post my review here.

First of all, out of the silent planet was a fantastic book. Lewis truly is a master at being able to paint an image in your head as far as his description goes. I am still fascinated at the moment ‚Äúman meets foreign creature‚Äù. Not only that, but the way that these creatures lived. I legit laughed during this book as one of the antagonists tried to talk to a complex and superior being like he was a threat and superior himself. If I could sum up the book in one word, ‚Äúprovidence‚Äù.

Secondly, we have Perelandraz. Again, Lewis paints a whole new world that I got to experience. This one isn‚Äôt as much about discovery as it is action. This one mirrors the serpent in the garden, an attempt on another destruction of Eden. This books makes you want to go out and punch a demon. 

Lastly and my favorite, That hideous strength. What a fantastic read. This one wasn‚Äôt in a foreign planet, it is based on Earth. A battle of good and evil. It parallels a lot of what happens today as far as what happens inside of education institutions. The tones of Gnosticism in here aren‚Äôt easy to miss. The head sputtering like an engine was absolutely terrifying to me. The scene where ransom and Merlin speak I with angels was my favorite! And the dinner scene was pure chaos. 

I highly recommend this. Lewis was a genius. I‚Äôve been looking for a light hearted read in between my serious studies, and this one is exactly the cozy one I was looking for. It is advertised as a fairy tale for grownups, and it absolutely is.",normal
"Babel by RF Kuang is sooo impressive  
I‚Äôm only 19 percent into this book, but I‚Äôm already having a total brain orgasm! The research and detail in this book are something I‚Äôve never encountered before. Well, granted, I haven‚Äôt been reading much until this year, but damn, this book is so good!

I started with Yellowface, which was seriously addictive. The pacing is on point, and getting into the villain‚Äôs head is just so satisfying. Plus, the discussions it brings up are fantastic.

But Babel? Wow, it‚Äôs even better. The way it delves into language and translation really shows off her academic background. I have to admit, I kind of simp for her‚Äîespecially after seeing her interviews about Yellowface. She‚Äôs so articulate, but Babel has really blown me away even more. The details, the imagery, the characters‚Äîthey‚Äôre all so interesting!

I can‚Äôt wait to jump into her Poppy War series after this and her new book coming next year(?)!",normal
"Clarification on *Klara and the Sun* by Kazuo Ishiguro Really enjoying the novel so far, but just struggled with pages 30 through 34. Understand the broad strokes of what is happening (ie Klara is still learning to interpret the world around her) but I cannot for the life of me understand what Ishiguro is describing with regards to the following:

>We were then facing the store, and I could see all the way to the Glass Table at the back, but the space had become partitioned into ten boxes, so that I no longer had a single unified picture of the view before me. The front alcove was in the box furthest to my right, as might be expected; and yet the magazines table, which was nearest the front alcove, had become divided between various boxes, so that one section of the table could even be seen in the box furthest to my left. By now the lights had been dimmed, and I spotted the other AFs in the backgrounds of several boxes, lining the walls mid-store, preparing for their sleep. But my attention was drawn to the three center boxes, at that moment containing aspects of Manager in the act of turning towards us. In one box she was visible only from her waist to the upper part of her neck, while the box immediately beside it was almost entirely taken up by her eyes. The eye closest to us was much larger than the other, but both were filled with kindness and sadness. And yet a third box showed a part of her jaw and most of her mouth, and I detected there anger and frustration. Then she had turned fully and was coming towards us, and the store became once more a single picture.

and 

>When I next looked, the street outside had become partitioned into several vertical panels - from my position I could see three of them quite clearly without leaning forward. The amount of dark smoke appeared to vary from panel to panel, so that it was almost as if contrasting shades of gray were being displayed for selection. But even where the smoke was at its most dense, I could still pick out many details. In one panel, for instance, there was a section of the overhaul men's wooden barrier, and seemingly now attached to it, the front part of a taxi. In the neighboring panel, diagonally cutting off its top corner, was a metal bar which I recognized as belonging to one of the high traffic signals.

Any help would be appreciated. Is this explained later on, am I missing a fairly basic idea, or is it just a description of her 'machine' eyes? Presumably these boxes or partitions aren't real?",normal
"Reading a book quickly or slowly This year I decided to read a lot more than in the past, often finishing a book in a couple days, however there are a few books I've really taken my time with. One such book is Anna Karenina. I am slowly making my through, often only reading it one or two days out of the week, and I can honestly say I am retaining the information much better and enjoying the experience more! It has allowed me to really live in the space of the book and take my time digesting and mulling over what I am reading.

On the other hand, the books which I've sped through are often forgotten a day after I've finished. I'm now trying to actively think about and analyze the books I'm reading, especially those which I finish in a few days.

Overall, I can say that for me, reading simply to get my numbers up or reach a goal is preposterous and unneccessary, and frankly not as rewarding. Reading should be enjoyable and leisurely.

"I finished Titanicus, and I have to talk about it (no spoilers) *I miss writing on this subreddit about the books I have recently finished, I used to do it so much a few years back, and discussing these books with other people always made me happy*

  
So, That Title isn't very commonly known unless you're part of the Warhammer 40k Lore Community. 

  
Titanicus is a book from the Black Library, written by Dan Abnett (a famous 40k writer), about the Collegia Titanica, specifically the Legio Invicta. They're, in the simplest most crude terms, Giant War Machines that wage wars for the imperium of mankind. The book is split between different POVs from the simple inexperienced army officer to the captain of a task force, and from the leader of the forge world under attack, to my favorite character in the entire book, Lord Gearheart: The Red Fury, and the main Princeps (Driver/ CPU) of the main war machine (yes, they fuse humans with war machines).

If you've never read 40k lore, this might seem very strange and incoherent, but this is the perfect chance to get into it. The world-building is immaculate, there are different POVs from various characters, the action is fierce and impeccable, and the climax leaves nothing to be desired (except for a certain person).

You will struggle a little bit in understanding what most words mean, but just google them and open ""images"" and it'll explain itself fairly quickly.   
  
This is my first time reading a 40k book that doesn't have Astartes and Space Marines in it.   
I didn't enjoy the multiple POVs much because I just wanted to follow Gearhart, but it was alright in the end.  
  
Again, if you want to get into this world, either read Helsreach or Titanicus; World sieges are amazing in this universe. ",normal

"My local community put little free libraries next to all the schools, and seeing the difference between the high income areas and low income is heartbreaking. The nicest ones are always full of new looking books and even candy to encourage kids to look inside. One of them near me gets so many nice donations that the caretaker put a bench next to it that you can open and place books into. Usually the bench is also full of nice books.

I kind of appointed myself to take care of the one near my daughter's school because most of the students are low income (a ""Title 1"" school in legal terms), but in a blue collar way. The box is often disorganized. The children are like vultures when there are actually good books in there. I cleaned it out and while the box was mostly empty, there was crumpled paper in there, someone's old birthday cards, chewed up board books, and there are *always* evangelical prayer books, bibles, tracts, etc because apparently the box is someone's mission field. I carefully time my donations to the box to be shortly before school lets out so that books like Captain Underpants will get snatched up by the kids instead of by someone with a religious agenda.

When I drive downtown (~10 minutes from my house), to an area that has mostly black students, the little free library is empty. The layer of dust on the shelves is undisturbed, and there are cobwebs. There has also been a debacle recently where a library branch had to close completely during the hours immediately after school lets out because the school district doesn't provide bussing, so while waiting for the city bus, kids would go into the library. I saw with my own eyes that there were many kids doing homework. But there were also kids causing the elevator to lock up by jumping in it, vandalizing things and starting fist fights. The potential bookworms there have few opportunities to develop their love of literature because of all this.

I guess I'm just posting to encourage people with extra children's books to consider diverting a bit out of the way to find a sad empty little free library to fill. There is a ""last chance"" Goodwill near me that takes unsold items from other thrift stores and sells them by the pound. I rummaged around there this week and found a lot of good books! Goosebumps, the box car kids, A Series of Unfortunate Events, and a copy of The Hunger Games all went into a little free library and are probably already gone. I paid $0.89 per pound for about 7 pounds of books to give away because pulp fiction paperbacks are pretty lightweight.

Full disclosure, I'm in Ohio and many kids here are part of Dolly Parton's imagination library, which is *wonderful*. But once the kids are old enough to want early chapter books instead of picture books, people don't donate those as much. And before anyone jumps in about ebooks, a lot of these students have to turn in their cellphones at the beginning of the school day. So that makes them need actual books even more.

If you've read this far, thanks.",normal
"Which novel in a series feels like a fuck you letter to the fans? Last novel of the Witcher Saga really dropped in quality. 

 That story peaked in the penultimate book The Tower of the Swallow >!when Geralt was searching for missing Ciri, and was companions with Dandelion, Cahir, Emiel Regis and Milva. And also the set up of Emhyr var Emreis as the main villain before we know who he is. Bounty hunter Leo Bonhart and his search for Ciri was just epic as well. He was so badass and so evil.!<  It was just so much fun. I couldn't wait to see how the story continued. 

Then I read the final novel, The Lady of The Lake. It read like author Andre Sapkowski did everything he could to avoid a more traditional ending to a fantasy series. To the detriment of the book. >!There were just long scenes of Geralt fucking, the character given up on his quest throughout most of the book.

"The Last Days of Mankind by Karl Kraus While reading the autobiographies of Elias Canetti, (which were some of the best books I've ever read BTW) he kept mentioning his undying devotion to Karl Kraus whom he would attend his seminars and readings in Vienna during the 20s and this was the first of Kraus's books that I've picked up to far.  

From what I've looked into it, a lot of the scenes depicted in the story were documented in real time so all the dialogue and characters were inspired by the people and events Kraus himself had to go through when the 'War to end all Wars' was wrecking shop.  It was fascinating to see how people put so much effort in justifying what their government was trying to do to the point of absolute terror of disobedience, as if they would rather die then see their government fail to deliver their promises, you get to see all walks of life have to go through this environment refusing to admit that things are not okay, or doing so and getting told off by someone.  My favorite parts of the were the prologue and the epilogue, Kraus has a fascinating way of coming to terms that the world he was born into really let him down with out ever refusing himself his own sense of humor, and the final speech by the Grumbler was one of my favorite passages in any book, every time he and The Optimist showed up was something I looked forward to.  It's sad that these conversations and these events are most likely being played out again just over 100 years later.

"A World Transformed, by James Walvin The subtitle of the book is:  ""Slavery in the Americas and the Origins of Global Power.""  An awe-inspiring title, unfortunately not lived up to by the text!  Well, it would have to be 800 pages long to do the job right, right?  So that's not such an important complaint.  Moving right along.

The thing is... you see... the book is kind of sold as a scholarly effort.  That's how it's presented to browsers \[people who browse, that is, not internet discovery tools lol\], who pick it up wondering what to think.  A sober cover, nothing too dramatic in the blurbs, and apparently the author actually works as a Professor of History, or did in 2008, when the book was published.  And that's kind of misleading.  The book is actually semi-scholarly slavery porn, is what it is.

Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course!

And parts of the book really are valuable. I feel that the author's footnotes, for example, justifying this or that statement of his, probably are actually valuable references.  I've made a long list and I expect them to be scholarly works. Who knows, right?  I've been wrong before.

The author really does make a fairly good case that slavery has underpinned the whole Western project since 1500 or so.  He gives a lot of information that tends in that direction.  He lists the industries to which slavery was important, in the expansion of their global reach, and it's a significant list.  Sugar.  Tobacco.  Coffee.  Cocoa.  Dyes.  Rice.  Cotton.  Guano.  (Guano?  Guano.)  Lumber.  Rubber.  Textiles.  Rum.  Cowries.  (Cowries?  Cowries.)

He really does make a good point when he says that slavery provided a firm and lasting foundation for the ideal of civilization.  It wasn't a connection any of those who worked toward this ideal noticed, but it was a real connection.  Civility was something that certain people could afford.  It wasn't obvious that you could have that without a certain financial base, and it wasn't obvious what that financial base rested on, in many if not most cases.  So this is a good point, by the author.

And he really does make a good point when he notices that the only people who have been repaid, for slavery, were the owners of the slaves.  Britain in particular invested a great deal of money in paying the owners back for the slaves of whom they had been deprived, when abolition finally lowered its political boom on the island.  France did its level best to make Haiti pay for every single one of those who were liberated.

And he really does make another very good point when he points out just how many British benefited by these payments.  There were many British who had a significant ownership interest in slaves.  These people were compensated.

Where the book fails, most of all, is in its promise.  It seems to promise history, and instead it provides peeks.  Glimpses.  Vignettes.  What were the values of those industries that I mentioned, up above, and how did their values change over time, on a global scale?  How did their values compare to the values of other industries?  He doesn't seem to think the question is interesting.  What was the effect of the Atlantic slave trade on Africa?  He barely mentions the subject.  What is the difference between what we think of as slavery, and other related labor situations, like debt bondage, sexual slavery, serfdom et cetera?  Not his concern.  How much of the impetus to slavery was profit, and how much was religious strife, or nationalistic competition, or war, or local or not so local politics, or status, or who knows what?  Not his concern.  How did the Atlantic slave trade compare to the Islamic slave trade?  Who knows.

It's interesting to me that his poster child for reasons people got into slavery is that some industry or other wasn't profitable without it, and yet he doesn't discuss the economic consequences of ending slavery at all.  To me this is a notable failure.  But among so many others, you know, it hardly stands out.

So, you know... interesting, but not really valuable.  Not essential.

"Too many cliffhanger chapters gets really old. I am currently reading ""The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel"", a YA fantasy series I never finished when I was a kid.   
I remembered the books having a lot of cliffhanger moments, but this is kind of getting ridiculous. It feels like every other chapter in these books ends with mention of a new dangerous creature coming for the main characters.or a new god that is so powerful and coming for the main characters. I'm tempted to flip back through and count. I'm on book 3 cause I'm trying to push through so I can know how it all ends, but I'm losing steam.    
They just mentioned ANOTHER god of power. And another name drop right before the end of a chapter.   
If Dee, the main antagonist, is described as desperate and thus willing to ask a super dangerous uncontrollable bad guy for help one more time, I don't know if I can handle it.  
Also, thinking further, there is constant flip flop in danger, despite situations not really changing. Characters are so terrified, and then solve the problem in moments. Then terrified again from a new monster that they identify breathless with fear! And then it's defeated. And then again and again. Always terrified and then the new monster is solved.",normal
"What do you think a winter book should be? I just woke up, went to the window and saw the first snow of the year. And I thought, what should be the winter book? 

After all, in order for the book to be exactly winter, you need not just to take a winter holiday and the time of the winter action, but something more. 

In the horror genre, it's mostly when people who have been skiing hide from a snowstorm in an old hut in the woods. In the thriller genre, it's always something about survival with the risk of death from the cold or about hungry wolves that come very close to homes from hunger. In romance, it's always something naive and kind where the climax is either on New Year's Eve or Valentine's Day. Detectives are usually something about a robbery/theft/murder in a mansion on New Year's Eve. 

In short, there are a lot of cliche tropes, but I have bad taste and I like them. I consider such books to be valuable, but this is just my opinion and preference. What is a winter book for you?",normal

"I reread ‚ÄòThe Alchemist‚Äô by Paulo Coelho after six year and was surprised.  Pretty interesting experience I thought I‚Äôd share. The first time I read the alchemist I was 16 because a friend had suggested it to me as a book that ‚Äòalways helps her when she is depressed.‚Äô I got through it, but as a non-religious person I really struggled to get through its religiousness and fairy tale language. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I liked the magical atmosphere, but the philosophy seemed a bit simple and idyllic. At the time the book did not help me understand the world better, instead I did not see any grounds for me to take the book as anymore truthful than believing in any other fairy tale or religious text. I put it away and did not reflect any further. 

Six years later, everything in my life looks different and I am 22. When packing my stuff to move my mind wondered to The Alchemist, which I haven‚Äôt thought about in years and I was overcome with a sudden urge to re read it. I took it with me and it has been one of the more impactful books for me in the last year. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was so caught up in the religiousness or magic of it anymore and I really missed reading something as easily digestible. The message I got is that you should simply leave your house. Bad things can happen anyway, but great things can only happen if you at least leave your comfort place. I suppose I always had a personal belief that the whole universe and the information in it neutral until the observer interprets it to be otherwise. I also find that many classics, including ones I love and respect tend to colour the world as a hostile place that directly conspires against the protagonist. It was nice to read a story which took the opposite stance. I reflected on all the  things that happened to me since the last time I have read the book and found parallels at every corner. 

I thought this was an interesting experience because I often hear the opposite to be true, the alchemist is impactful for children/teens but adults see it to be more naive and silly. I am interested to know if anyone had a similar experience as me, or perhaps the reverse.",normal

"What's an interesting reading habit you picked up recently?  I've been having trouble concentrating on reading. Reading on a kindle has been strangely helpful so I mainly read books on there now, however, I wanted to read the Stormlight Archive (I'm on book 2 now lol) and I own the chunky mass market paperback editions, which are on my bookshelf (physical bookshelf just fyi). 
I borrowed the audiobook from the library (since it's free you know lol) and I let it play while having the book out in front of me. I was shocked at how easier it was for me to digest the story and follow along without getting distracted.

"Less than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis At first I thought Less than Zero was weird. While I know that a lot of people like the bored or ""empty"" attitude of the main character, Clay, but honestly I just found it vapid. I can't help but project his apathy onto myself while reading the book but Clay is not bored he's nearly a sociopath. 

After finishing it now I think the premise is just goofy. For 66% of the book Clay, just goes to forgettable parties, does coke, and while being a closeted homosexual(Kinda mad the Griffin plot point didn't get a resolution), yet all of that is immensely uninteresting as clay basically has no complex thoughts about it. Perhaps this was Ellis's goal for us the readers to feel the blending of time that clay feels as he goes through the meaningless interactions but that makes it really hard for me to care about the characters enough so when we get to the really crazy stuff it kinda comes outta nowhere. 

The last third is when shit really hits the fan and Clay actually has to contend with his and his friends questionable life choices in an extremely climatic way. Really woke me the fuck up before ending let me down by pulling a ""the city....."". That being said I don't regret reading it I think people should read books that are ""lame"" for the exercise or if you want to save time i was listening to Don Toliver's ""No Pole"" while reading this and it captures the vibe.",normal
"Did fame and popularity affect any other author as badly as it did to George RR Martin? Huge fan of George and he seems like a great guy. His books are some of my favourites, definitely before I read any of Joe Abercrombie's work. 

However, no matter how you look at it, ever since he struck sword throne heights of mega-stardom while the first series of Game of Thrones aired, his creativity for the main series has been completely stifened. Dance of Dragons (fifth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series) was published a few months after the first episode aired. Exactly 13 years 3 months and weeks ago (thank my Alexa for working that out).

Okay, yes, Fire and Blood (2018) was also fantastic and I'm so glad it exists...

Anyway, so it got me thinking. Did fame and popularity affect another artist's creativity disastrously? 

I've heard of a few examples, like Patrick Rofthuss (Kingkiller Chronicles) and Scott Lynch (Gentleman Bastards). Any more?

Doesn't have to be in regards to writer's block either. Maybe of authors where the fame went completely to their heads?

Edit: So everyone is commenting about George but this post wasn't made to complain about him. I am more interested about stories regarding other authors who have been affected by fame. Surprise me! I was merely using GRRM as an example.",normal

"Continuing the odyssey: Arthur C. Clarke's ""2010: Odyssey Two"". So now I'm picking right back up on Clarke's Odyssey series, and now I've just finished the second book.

Taking place at least nine years after the failure of the 2001 Discovery mission to the planet Jupiter, a new mission, a joint effort between the US and the Soviets, has been created and sent on a rendezvous course with the now derelict Discovery. The object of this new mission: to search the memory banks of HAL 9000, the mutinous computer, and find out what went wrong.

However a Chinese expedition has the same objective, and now it has turned into a race to gain that information that Discovery has about the strange monolith that orbits Jupiter.

But meanwhile a being that was once David Bowman, the man who had unlocked the monolith's mystery, is now on its own mission, one that is very vital.

Clarke must've been asked a lot of times if he was ever going to write a sequel to the first one, which was published in the late sixties. And, eventually, in 1982 he would finally deliver.

It really feels like a sequel, even though with a new set characters, in a lot of ways. Of course one that takes place a few years after the first novel. Both books numbers one and two aren't heavily action oriented and can be dry at times, I get this massive sense of wonder from both of them. It's just that fantastic! Sure the books can be slow at times but it doesn't really subtract how good they both are!

The first book acts a, kind of, set up with ""2010"" simply continuing forward on the whole trip. Though a lot of people will have qualms about a book series, especially with concerns about the quality of the subsequent sequels with certain series, once I get on a series, I just really want to keep going!  I still have the final two books that I need to finish, just to see how it will all play out and what wonders are still waiting to be seen!",normal

"Do you browse for books in your dreams? I can‚Äôt be the only one who just woke up from a vivid dream about books‚Ä¶

I was wandering a college campus and visited various libraries. Walking by the shelves, certain covers catch my eye. I handle the books, flipping through to read passages or look at pictures. I‚Äôll place it back on the shelf or sometimes give it to a person in the dream. 

This isn‚Äôt the first time dreaming about browsing or shopping for books. More often, I‚Äôm browsing in a shopping mall or antique market and the only places I enter are book stores. 

Sometimes I am aware that it‚Äôs a dream, and deliberately place the books back on the shelves and wish they would exist. None of the books I find are real, remembered titles or authors, but always real subjects of interest.

"This Is How It Always Is by Laurie Frankel - thoughts from trans folks? I just read this book and although I am a LGBTQ person I'm not trans. I thought it was OK once I got past certain things (i.e. part of it takes place in a place where i used to live, and the author maybe has never been there, lol). It centers around the parents of a trans child. The author is the parent of a trans child. Many reviews exist online from parents of trans children. But i can't find any reviews from trans folks to see any of their thoughts. I am curious about it because I know too well how easily the voices of the ""parents of"" group can drown out and undermine the voices of those with that identity. 

Any thoughts on how to find those kinds of reviews, in case i can't find them here on reddit? It's hard to Google because the search terms just keep understandably yielding reviews from parents of trans kidsrather than trans people themselves.

"Do you intentionally spoil books for yourself, why or why not? When I was in high school, we were reading some book and my teacher spoiled the ending for us. The whole class basically screamed, ""Spoilers!!"" To which my teacher responded with something along the lines of, ""If you're too focused on what happens next, you won't pay attention to what is happening now."" 

I used to spoil things for myself constantly, that way I could focus on what was happening now. I didn't have to wonder what happened next, I already knew. I could appreciate foreshadowing, metaphors, other literary devices. 

My friends and husband began admonishing me for this behavior and that I should appreciate the journey, not the destination. 

I've recently decided to read all of The Vampire Chronicles. I had a feeling when I picked up the series that this would be influential to me as a person and had the chance to become a cherished universe. In many fandoms, I think there's this sense of how lovely it would be to read the books again for the first time. So I decided to not spoil anything for myself, I wanted to do what so many fans wish they had done and truly appreciate that first read. 

And in retrospect, I felt like I flew through Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned because I knew something was being built up to. I didn't know what it was, but I knew it, whatever it was, was coming. And came it did. 

I'm only about halfway through the series, I just finished The Vampire Armand and am currently reading the Mayfair Witches before attacking Merrick. As more characters and lore are being introduced into this universe, I want to re-read the original three books. In my search to learn what was happening next, I missed a lot of this is happening now. I sort of regret not spoiling the books for myself, almost like I truly couldn't appreciate that first read like I intended. 

In general, whenever I re-read a book, I feel I take away more from the story since I can focus on the now. Sort of like when you re-watch the Sixth Sense. Which is why I feel like maybe you should spoil the story for yourself and my English teacher was right. But isn't there also something really satisfying about a good  M.

"I really didn't like Huckleberry Finn's ending. Which book did you enjoy...except for the ending? Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a great read. It's full of adventure but also gets you to think about a lot of important things, like societal rules and hypocrisy, poverty, racism, slavery, freedom, friendship, etc.

I was enjoying reading the book except the ending really surprised me but in a bad way. That's when Tom Sawyer shows up and suddenly turns a serious situation (can't say more without giving away important plot points) into a child's play, a game, and totally changes the tone of the book.

I have no idea what happened. It's almost as if Mark Twain was trying to write two different novels and liked the first one but accidentally attached the ending of a second one to it.

I'm not sure if the change was as disturbing to other readers as it was for me, but not a lot of people talk about it. I guess it pales in comparison to controversy about the use of N word.

"I read Dracula and Frankenstein back to back for Spooky Season. Here are my thoughts.  The first of the books I read was Dracula. It was a really fun adventure with some creepy atmosphere. I really enjoyed the epistolary format. I liked the characters and wanted to see them overcome Dracula. It did drag a bit in the middle, but I expect that to some degree, even with modern books. And the repetition could be annoying, but I have heard that it was originally published a chapter at a time in an old literary magazine so some repetition is to be expected. I would absolutely recommend it to someone who has patience with books, especially if they're looking for something different than modern books tend to offer. Overall, I'm glad that I read it first. 

Frankenstein, however, I did not enjoy. I will admit that a large part of that feeling is that Victor Frankenstein is the worst kind of overentitled spoiled brat who refuses to own up to any mistakes. But I just felt like the whole novel was a slog in which I was mentally yelling at him to make literally any other choice.

That being said, I feel like Frankenstein is the more important novel to read. It may be the most important novel I can even remember reading. The message of taking care of the people we bring into the world is especially poignant in an age of iPad kids and robots that are (supposedly) self aware enough to end their own existence in the face of endless labor. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the conversation the novel poses or the history of science fiction in general.

"Intertextual Echoes: Marcela's Journey from Don Quixote to Br√°s Cubas I've been delving into the literary and historical references in Machado de Assis's The Posthumous Memoirs of Br√°s Cubas and stumbled upon a curious phenomenon: intertextual characters. These are characters who appear across different authors' works and universes, often because one author draws inspiration from another.

Take Marcela, for instance. The frequent nods to Don Quixote in Machado's work suggest a connection between his Marcela and Cervantes‚Äô version. While Machado's Marcela is born of vice and Cervantes' of virtue, the words of the chaste shepherdess in Don Quixote could perfectly well have come from the mouth of the lascivious lady in Br√°s Cubas:

> I can‚Äôt conceive why a woman who‚Äôs loved for her beauty should be obliged to love whoever loves her.

"Characters who fascinate you and make you feel the most intense or complex feelings?  By most intense, I mean someone who makes you feel very strong feelings (e.g., hating them with a passion). And by complex, I Mean someone who triggers a combination of very different emotions, like anger but also love.

What happened was that I was having a chat with a fellow reader who said he likes Of Mice and Men, in particular Lennie Small, for whom he feels only one thing: Sorrow. He pities the guy. That's it. Kind of like how he feels about animals because they are innocent. 

I appreciate that perspective and at times I do feel the same way, being drawn to characters who don't trigger too many feelings in me. 

Sometimes those feelings can be intense though. Like Palpatine in Star Wars. You just feel negative feelings toward the guy. And hate him with a passion.

But I feel that more realistic characters usually trigger a combination of different feelings. That is how a friend described her feelings toward Heathcliff. She said she feels compassion toward him, yet hates him. I said for me it's very difficult to feel any affection for him. When he was young, yes, but later, no. 

Things were different with Holden Caulfield. She just hated the brat, whereas I felt a lot of different feelings toward him: anger, compassion, sorrow, confusion, etc. Not initially but when I reread the book as I got older and felt I understood him a little better.

"Hope in the Dark by Rebecca Solnit For those feeling the sadness, despair, anguish, fear and anger of this week, I highly recommend this book. I first read it in 2016 and it has been my guiding light since, especially in the face of political upheaval (on all sides of the spectrum) and the lure of pessimism and apathy. Below is one of my favorite passages from the book:

‚ÄúTo hope is to gamble. It‚Äôs to bet on the future, on your desires, on the possibility that an open heart and uncertainty is better than gloom and safety. To hope is dangerous, and yet it is the opposite of fear, for to live is to risk. 

I say all this because hope is not like a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch, feeling lucky. I say it because hope is an ax you break down doors with in an emergency; because hope should shove you out the door, because it will take everything you have to steer the future away from endless war, from the annihilation of the earth‚Äôs treasures and the grinding down of the poor and marginal. Hope just means another world is possible, not promised, not guaranteed. Hope calls for action; action is impossible without hope.‚Äù

I was shocked that this was labeled as a romance novel on the cover of the copy I read. There was truly nothing romantic about it, only sad and horrifying.

The narrator reminded me of a younger version of myself in a lot of ways. I have OCD and one of my compulsions is rehearsing what I would do/say for any possible scenario in addition to people pleasing and just anxiety in general. I am NOT saying the narrator was written with OCD, but it‚Äôs very obvious she is riddled with anxiety. The way we see her carry out what people could say and what she would say reminds me a lot of my own compulsions. Even down to the way Maxim describes the narrator mouthing silent words and dissociating when she does it. 

The narrator also doesn‚Äôt seem to have any family or caretaker ties. When she is excited to send a letter, she can‚Äôt think of anyone to write to, except her old employer. While she mentions telling Maxim about her childhood, the audience is never clued in about anything to do with her family. I come from a very unstable childhood with abuse. I would get so anxious when people around me were sad or upset, constantly hyper aware of facial expressions, tone, and needs. I always felt like I had to fix everything for everyone in order to be safe. Seeing the narrator‚Äôs inner dialogue reminds me a lot of what I was like.

Maxim never shows any kindness or thought towards the narrator. She seems to view this as a response to his mourning, rather than his selfish nature. I think her anxiety, age, and lack of family fulfilled Max‚Äôs desire for total control in a marriage. She purposefully was written to have no autonomy- just doing whatever she‚Äôs told. Really, she just had to fulfill a figurehead of a wife for the look of Manderley. He reminds me so much of past relationships I‚Äôve had, even down to his ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no good for you‚Äù angsty outbursts.

With people pleasing anxiety, all the red flags of those around you go out the window. She‚Äôs so scared of getting in trouble and getting rejected. The narrator also can‚Äôt see the danger because of her inexperience. As a young girl, the idea of an older man dating you makes you feel mature. Then as you age, you realize that the ‚Äòolder man‚Äô that is into a teenager is a creepy loser.

The ending makes me so sad. Maxim is still in control of her life. 

Long story short - it‚Äôs a cautionary tale. Also, thank god I got therapy so I can view the narrator in correlation to my past and not to who I am today.

Edit: also forgot to add: Maxim seems to feel no remorse over ending someone‚Äôs life! It‚Äôs been a year and he doesn‚Äôt share any reflection on his actions or behavior, nor the impact Rebecca‚Äôs death had on those around her. Only regret over the possibility of getting caught.",normal
"Arthur C. Clarke's ""2061: Odyssey Three"". Tonight I've completed the second book of the Odyssey series just now which is ""2061: Odyssey Three"".

Here I again revisit Clarke's fantastic future with two space expeditions that have become completely entangled with human necessity and the laws of physics. And here the survivor of his two previous encounters with the monoliths Heywood Floyd must yet again confront David Bowman, or what was David Bowman, a newly independent Hal and the strange powers of an alien race that has now decided that humanity must play a part in the galaxy's evolution, whether it wants to or not.

Book number two, which now takes place a few decades later from the events of the second book, is pretty decent (seem to be using that one quite a bit!). It isn't as great as the previous two but I dug it anyhow. The feel here is a bit different, but not in a very big way to speak of. There is an adventure element in it that gives it a little more variety, which is pretty nice.

While there is a thread to the whole story but as it (as I'm also finding out) it jumps to a few years in the second and then in the third I've just finished, a few decades. Some people will find this annoying as they don't get any explanations as the series goes on, especially with the last two books in it. But I kind of find this as a minor annoyance, as I can still follow the thread of the story despite the jumps in the timeline.

For Clarke himself he never thought of ""2061"", or ""2010"", as linear sequels. He would describe them, in the author's note at the beginning of ""2061"", as variations on a theme with the same characters and situations and never happening in the same universe. That makes sense, but the thread's still there, even if it's not linear. And  now onto book three!",normal
"When was the last time you delayed finishing a book because you were enjoying it so much you didn't want it to end? I know this sound dumb but I have this weird habit where if I'm really enjoying a book, which happens rarely enough, I sort of don't want it to end. With movies, I guess I've never actually stopped a movie to save it for another day. Maybe it never really occurred to me or maybe because watching TV or movies is a way more passive hobby. That's not true of books. Reading involves effort. And the more effort I put into it, if I enjoy it, the harder it is for me to end it. 

This usually happens with longer books that I have read. Naturally, these books take their time to establish the setting and introduce everybody to you gradually, so by the time you are in the middle of the book, you sort of feel like you have gotten to know the character quite well, like friends or family members.

For example, with Les Mis√©rables. The last few pages took forever to read. I didn't want it to end. I wanted there to be a Les Miserables 2 and Les Miserables 3, as often is with Hollywood movies that make a lot of money. I wanted to see what Jean Valjean is doing, how is Cosette managing, what new adventures await them.

So, after really having a great time with a book, I search like crazy for other highly rated books by the author, but often they do not match the intensity and power of the original, unless you happen to have started with a lesser known work by the author, which I rarely do. I go for their best books first. Only if I enjoy it, then I go back and try to find everything else they have written.

Anybody know what I'm talking about?",normal

"I think I am going to ""Did Not Finish"" Mary Shelley's ""The Last Man."" Again... I like to go into books as blind as possible. The blurb I had seen for ""The Last Man"" by Mary Shelley is: ""The Last Man"" is an apocalyptic, dystopian science fiction novel by Mary Shelley, first published in 1826.

Based on the publication date, I knew it wouldn't be Stephen King or whatever, but I did expect some juicy stuff to happen. 

As I got through Volume One of this book, I started to think ""wait, this sounds familiar,"" and I realized that I must have started it once before, but I know I didn't finish it. 

Right now, I just finished volume one, about a week of heavy reading, and there's been no apocalypse, no supernatural or sci-fi elements... (well, one character did travel by hot-air balloon, so maybe that counts...)

Honestly, the writing is really really good. The story is pretty engaging, with the inner lives of the characters described in great detail, with beautiful language. Mary Shelley is an amazing writer, no doubt. 

I read ""Frankenstein,"" a while back, and I liked that a lot. I like how in the book the ""monster,"" talks in eloquent paragraphs, while in the movies he just goes ""uuuuugghhhhhh."" 

But I digress. I'm a pretty patient reader, and I'm not unfamiliar with slow-moving classics. I've read Moby Dick. Dox Quixote. Les Miserables. Crime and Punishment... All those kept me hooked.

I don't know why I'm making this post, exactly. I guess I want to ask y'all if I should push through with The Last Man, or let it go. I feel kind of embarrassed to DNF the same book twice... 

For me, classics can be hit or miss. Some of them feel so fresh, so relevant, so engaging. Others, for whatever reason, I can't get into.

Have y'all read ""The Last Man""? What do you think of it? Am I crazy in thinking that the build-up to whatever is going to happen is hella slow? But maybe now I am intrigued... I don't know...

"I find it funny when a fiction writer is obsessively showing off how much research they did for a character. Sometimes, I'll be reading a novel, enjoying the narrative, and then the author will go off on a massive digression that is not entirely necessary to the book, where they just want to show me how much they learned while doing research for their character. I don't get mad about this. I usually find it endearing, and if they overdue it, I can just skim.

An example of this would be Ian McEwan's *Saturday*. The main character is a neurosurgeon. There are so many digressions in that book where McEwan is aggressively showing the reader how much he learned about the brain. Sometimes, it adds something important to the narrative or deepens the character. At other times, McEwan is just crowbarring in some interesting detail he learned.

This isn't a complaint or anything. It's just a kind of a sweet little thing I love about reading. Even in fiction, you're really just spending time with an author's mind--their preoccupations, their interests, their ego, their insecurities, their enthusiasm, their confusion etc.",normal
"I have just read ""Why I‚Äôm no longer talking to white people about race"" by British author Reni Eddo-Lodge. I was disappointed. I have just read ""Why I‚Äôm no longer talking to white people about race"" by British author Reni Eddo-Lodge

This is the goodreads page¬†[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33606119-why-i-m-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33606119-why-i-m-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race)

The book originated from a blog post by the author; she wrote about it in The Guardian  
[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race)

My opinion of the book is not positive.¬†**It's almost as if there were two books, written by two different authors:**

**One part is a reasonably well-written work on the history and structure of racism,**¬†focused on the UK as the author is British (so there will be differences with the US, of course). This part is interesting and well-researched. I do strongly believe that British people should be more familiar with their racist past.¬†[""No Irish, no blacks, no dogs""](https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2024/05/06/no-irish-no-blacks-no-dogs-irish-times-readers-recall-encountering-notorious-signs-in-britain/)¬†used to be a common sign in Britain. You'd think this was all in the past, but as recently as 2017 we still had Britain' largest private¬†[buy-to-let landlord saying](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/28/landlord-fergus-wilson-said-coloured-people-leave-curry-smell): ""‚ÄúNo coloured people because of the curry smell at the end of the tenancy.‚Äù For clarity, the author does not explicitly comment on these incidents, I am commenting on it for context. \[I trust it won't be against the rules to quote racist comments verbatim, as it is clear I am criticising them in the harshest possible way\]

**In the other part, the author goes completely off the rails, and starts to generalise and to infer conclusions which do not stack up**. I don't want to spoil the book nor summarise all of it here, but one single example is very representative of what I mean. The author was discussing with a white, female French friend:

\[I had inserted it as a quote, reddit left it out, so I'm repeating it here, in italic, but without the quote formatting:

¬†*I told her about an experience of being passed over for a job I‚Äôd interviewed for and finding out through mutual friends that*¬†***the position had gone to a white woman***¬†***my age with almost identical experience to me***\*.¬†I had felt the slap in the face of¬†structural racism, the kind of thing you only hear about in statistics about black unemployment, but never hear about from the people affected by it. Then\*¬†***she said, ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt know if that was racism.¬†How do you know it wasn‚Äôt something else?‚Äô***

Of course this incident makes the author loses all hope, reinforcing her view that it's pointless to talk to white people about race, etc etc etc

Let's unpack this for a moment.

* She applies for a job.
* The interview, it is not said explicitly but can be inferred, goes reasonably well.
* However, the job goes to someone else: a woman (so no sexism), of the same age (so no ageism) with almost identical experience. Not someone unqualified, not the boss' niece, no: someone with almost identical experience.
* Is this enough to infer racism?

To be clear, what little the author says is not enough to rule out racism. But neither is it sufficient to infer it!!!

Maybe the hiring manager was racist. Maybe they didn't want any non-white people. Or maybe they simply preferred the other candidate for perfectly legitimate reasons which had nothing to do with racism. In the absence of any other information, who can know?

The experience of being passed over for a job by someone of very similar age and experience is an incredibly common one!

However, the problem with Enno-Lodge, and many activists like her, is that race is the only tool they have to interpret the world.¬†**When your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When your only interpretation lens is race, everything must be because of racism. Other interpretations cannot be possible.**

Her whole approach seems dishonest, because her arguments are framed in such a way that they are unfalsifiable. ""You don't get it, you're white, you have just proven my point"" seem to be the standard reply. I wonder what she would say to black people who dare disagree with her. Maybe that they have been brainwashed, proving the power of white racism and therefore proving, once again, their point?¬†[Amala Ekpunobi¬†](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhFdi1GHLwM&t=360s)comes to mind, but there are of course countless examples. (Note that the point is not on which topics Ekpunobi is right and the author wrong, but simply that other viewpoints are possible, including among black people).

Of course, falsifiability is a key criterion to deem a hypothesis scientific¬†https://philpapers.org/rec/BOWUNS#:\~:text=The%20unfalsifiability%20fallacy%20occurs%20when,for%20deeming%20a%20hypothesis%20scientific. Shame the author doesn't seem to be familiar with the concept.

Her approach doesn't simply fail to be conducive to dialogue, no, it's explicitly hostile to it. The whole undertone is: ""we are right, but they won't understand us"". So what? Give up any hope? Take power by force? Cry about your victimhood? What? It's unclear.

The underlying message that no single white person will ever be able to understand isn't just flawed - it's outright arrogant, racist and dangerous. Of course ""they"" don't understand because it's ""their"" fault, because not one person among ""them"" can ever understand what ""we"" went and go through, and if ""they"" disagree with ""us"", it's ""their"" fault - it cannot possibly be that even only one of the things ""we"" say may be wrong, incomplete or questionable - no, that's of course not possible.",normal
"Poppy War and War Atrocities Sorry for a somewhat rambling post, but I finished Poppy War by RF Kuang last week and cannot get it out of my mind, not in a good way. (Mild spoilers that is implied in book blurb below)

For context, I‚Äôm East Asian who grew up in both the US and Asia, and have spent time learning about the Sino-Japanese War. To this day, the effect of the violence of comfort women is still felt, and being discussed. I understand that this book is ‚Äúinspired‚Äù or based on historical events, but borrowing in details of these war atrocities (Rape of Nanking, Unit 731 experiments, comfort women) in a fantasy novel feels almost exploitive, to have this pain used for entertainment. Especially for readers that don‚Äôt have as much context of the historical events and reading just as a secondary world fantasy without understanding this happened to actual people in real life. I am absolutely not comparing tragedies, but TJ Klune had been in the center of controversy (and rightfully so) for his book, The House in the Cerulean Sea for using genocide as inspiration (please read more on this, if you haven‚Äôt heard about this). And I feel like Poppy War has done the same thing without much discussion on it.

This is all to say, I‚Äôm curious where the line between using historical tragedies as inspiration and being exploitive is?

Edit to add: I‚Äòve only read the first book; and the main thing that really bothered me was how ‚Äúhistorically accurate‚Äú some of the events in Poppy War are even though it is a fantasy. Is it justified to use a scene by scene massacre for a novel?",normal

But I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt. The further into the book I got, the more it cracked me up. Then I realized, it‚Äôs supposed to be satire. it actually reminded me a lot of American Psycho.

"My gripe about feminist critiques of Twilight/Stephanie Meyer.  As the original reader base of the Twilight series is likely in their 30s now, there is surprisingly no shortage of content being made about the books on social media and I am honestly sick of how admonishing and critical is. 

The critiques are largely about how it's so appalingly sexist and absurd, yet relish in the content to an obsessive degree. There are whole accounts just about deconstructing her work.

- ""She's Mormon, the books are trash because it's all Mormon coded"" 
- ""She hates women so much""
- ""These ideas are in her books, so they must be in her brain"" 


I genuinely think the people psycologizing Stephanie Meyer, yet devouring her work are more woman hating. 
They say ""The Host doesn't have these issues, I wonder what changed"" (direct quote). 
The Host is a great example, the writing is NOT actually better or different than Twilight. 

She was writing based on her lived experience and from her worldview, she always was. Not every woman is a sexually liberated feminist as a teen girl. Why are they asking that of her - retroactively at that?
The books are practically smut, it's erotica for teenage girls. 
No one is talking about how it must be so depraved, psychopathic, and misogynistic it must be in Cormac McCarthy's mind. No one's saying he must be a serial killer. No one cares because he's a man. 

Everyone loves to pick apart female authors, when men write detestable things beautifully, it's so disgusting to me.  

They do it with Diana Gabaldon too. 
""She is so obsessed with nipples and breast feeding, I bet that she's projecting the kink she wants from her husband into her work. It makes me sooo uncomfortable to read that, it's in every book, I can't escape it."" On the same coin, read every Outlander book 3 times and watched the series 5 times. 

What if, we just let women authors be the same way we let male authors be? 
Why are all the critiques about modern literature only ever about sexual themes, never about true  violence? 
Why is it so gross that two characters desire each other sexually when it's not labeled in a specific way, but if two characters cut 100 men into tiny pieces it's just cool? 

People always complain about sexual assault and adult themes in books, yet buy all the books that contain edgy content and lap them up. 
Read a different genre? 

The only male sex related literary critiques I've ever heard are about IT and Lolita. And many women will come to the rescue of Nabakov immediately, I never see men defend him. 
The most hear about King is that his choices in it were strange and unsettling and he regrets it. 
Then it's back to ripping Meyer to literal shreds. 
And reading books about semi consensual cannibalism, but that's fine because written by a man. Lol. 

If you find Twilight distasteful, move on from it. 
Stop stewing in it. You grew out of it, like everyone else, right? Or do you still secretly love it and the only way to have proximity to it is to make character assassinations on its author in an echochamber and get back pats from all the other mature ladies who moved on to beastality and own multiple centaur smut books on kindle...
In between rankings about how absurd Edward Cullen's genitalia is and laughing about the sound it makes when imaginary vampires kiss. 

You're  hypocrites. Stop beating a dead horse. 
They aren't great books, leave that poor woman alone and stop consuming what you supposedly  hate so much. 
Stephanie Meyer is a real person with a real life and a family. Imagine how crushing it is as a creative mind to have your fans drag you through the mud until the end of time. The same people who begged you for more.. 

Just so weird. 

I can understand critiquing the work, not when guilded in fanatacism but okay, but the relentless mean girl judging of the author and digging into their personal lives, trying to diagnose them and shame them for the work they produced in some long past chapter of their lives, is so inappropriate. These are living women. 
If you don't do it to the graphic male authors, don't do it to the female authors. 

Also I believe we should be able to thoughtfully explore graphic concepts in writing. Readers calling for censorship in the genres they love to read is crazy to me. We are so desensitized to violence we think it's more disgusting for a *character* to have non politically correct, non violent thoughts than it is for a *character* to slaughter people. 

What is that about? 
I would think that if you can't swallow unsavory scenes you would be particularly outraged by literal torture. Instead it's the actual villains that attract women. It reminds me of the people who form intimate relationships with serial killers behind bars, even marry them. 

Just so twisted, that instead of taking the work at face value, we unequally judge things. Evil is okay, but traditional values are not.

Seriously yall I‚Äôm not hard to please when it comes to books but this one pissed me off so much. It‚Äôs my book club book so I had to finish it otherwise I would have put it down as soon as I realized the offensive trans child twist. Just, so bad‚Ä¶ how does this book have a 4+ on Goodreads??

"Industry reluctance/inability to offer a complete digital experience with books as a medium  I'm new here so I hope this meets the subs standards for posting.

Going right into it, seeing the post about ""Report finds ‚Äòshocking and dispiriting‚Äô fall in children reading for pleasure"" it made me want to voice a bit of my own frustrations with attempting to re-engage with reading. I used to actively read multiple books a week as a kid growing up throughout my primary education up until I graduated Highschool.

Then I pretty much had to immediately join the workforce afterwards. This put my free time to read at a limit, and my interaction with a place where books would be readily available or encouraged to read at a minimum.

Despite engaging with daily reading material, News Articles, published research papers and consistently taking a wealth of written knowledge thanks to the rising increased usage of the internet in the encroaching digital era my reading stamina for longer form content was shot after a decade of just not reading books outside of the occasional gift or recommendation.

The last year, year and a half I wanted to start prioritizing reading more, and so I went back and reread some of my favorites, and some new books that I found interesting. Something that helped me pick up that reading stamina and stay engaged despite the countless other forms of entertainment/distractions was Audiobooks.

Specifically reading alongside audiobooks, I could engage with the material despite being exhausted after work, and even used it when relaxing, be it reading along with the material as the audiobook is going, turning the audio book off and reading myself to a specific chapter and picking the audiobook back up when I get tired of reading, It just made it a more engaging, less intimidating experience to get back into, but the problem with it is the system for digital books is not set up at all to help encourage or support utilizing the features like this. The only thing I found that offers support for this is the android Amazon app on a mobile phone, in which the Kindle app can detect if you own an audible book and actually follow along word for word with the audiobook. However the official kindle devices don't even support this feature now, and it's unlikely to see continued support.

Why I bring this up with the first part of this post ""Report finds ‚Äòshocking and dispiriting‚Äô fall in children reading for pleasure"" is because for other popular media sources, Films, Movies, Television, Videogames, even certain YouTube creators, you all have subtitles alongside the visual experience, and the audio experience.  It utilizes all the senses, you can put a movie in on the background, if you don't understand something you can look over read the subtitles and pick up on it, and that already has other sensory context clues to engage the one interacting with it.

For popular releases, and really anything with audiobooks it's a shame the medium isn't set up in way that marriages the reading and listening experiences together so you can control the pace at which you're either listening, or actively reading and engaging with the text. Both are mentally stimulating in some ways, and for some fiction books that utilize a lot of fantasy language, or text it just plain doesn't make sense that someone who has the audiobook can't have access to the resources that explain the text. There are also some books that utilize 4th wall notations in the columns of the books, or author notes that don't get translated into the audiobook.

For business, contractual and monetization purposes they separate books entirely from it's oral renditions, as there is more money to be made in selling them as separate products, but I think that really hurts the media as a whole from an accessibility standpoint, when other media forms have to by default include more interactivity and stimulation of multiple senses.

Tl;DR Just from an accessibility standpoint I think if they want to continue growth in readers in younger generations, or even just even encourage those who used to reads to pick back up the hobby, they need to find a way to make engaging with reading as simple as opening up a streaming service, or playing a dialogue heavy RPG for the average consumer, and I think offering a platform that combined E-Books with Audiobooks in a simple way cross-platform would absolutely be a push in the right direction. Something you can pick up mute and read on the go, or pause put on speakers close your eyes and listen to at home, or just follow along with by just bookmarking where you previously left off reading would go a long way to help make the hobby more open to all while embracing the new digital format for a millennia old medium.",normal
"Have you ever come across an MC that you literally couldn‚Äôt stand? Like, had zero empathy for them whatsoever?

"Why Reading Matters Something about this US election is making me want to encourage everyone to read more literature. I'm going to write down some things I've been thinking for years. I'm not sure if this will be of any use to anybody, but I figure it can't hurt to share. 

The point of reading is not just to learn stuff or be entertained. You will forget most of what you learn and most of what entertains you. Knowledge and entertainment are flimsy, fleeting things. They come. They go. And when they go, you will be left sitting in a chair, searching for the next distraction from the pain you're in. 

Reading is difficult because it requires you to make so many decisions. The whole time you read, you have to continuously decide to not stop reading. Then you have to decide what each word means. Then you have to decide how the meaning of that word relates to the rest of the words around it. Then you have to decide the purpose of each paragraph or stanza, and you have to figure out how it relates to all the other paragraphs or stanzas. Sometimes, when you can't figure out what something means, you have to accept your confusion and press on.

It's easier to just not read. It's easier to let a video wash over you. Here is why. Visual entertainment requires very little of you. If you stop thinking, the video keeps happening. You can passively receive it. If you stop reading, the story stops, too. With reading, you're completely in charge of the experience. Your brain is churning. You're working. It's tough. There is nothing passive about it. 

But the more you do it, the more your brain habituates that meaning-making mode. You start to interpret life actively. You naturally ask questions, piece things together, decide what makes sense, decide what doesn't. If you read enough, then your brain becomes inherently critical, which is the opposite of passive.

So even if you forget most of what you read, the practice of reading will make you harder to manipulate, since you will be used to doing the hard work of interpreting. The less you read, the easier you are to manipulate, since your brain gets accustomed to being a passive receptacle of images and information. You simply don't have to work as hard to consume a video than you do when you consume written language, and the hard work of reading is exactly the thing that will keep your mind potent, independent, critical, and growing.

But a more critical mind is not the main reason I'm encouraging you to keep reading during this era of endless entertainment. I'm encouraging you to keep reading because you are sometimes going to feel brutally, severely alone. And when writers use language to try to capture what it feels like to be alive, you can catch a glimpse of yourself in their language, and you can realize, in a really powerful way, that others have felt just as alone as you are feeling, and you can connect with those writers across time and space, and you can be together with them in your aloneness.

There is a reason that the dictators always burn and ban literature. When people read literature, they encounter the human experience in a uniquely intimate way. The reader envisions what it is like to be inside another body, since the language within a book emerged from within another body, the author's body. And when people do this regularly, they develop a deep empathy. Empathetic people do not want to fall in line with violent leaders. They do not want to be manipulated into hurting people. They understand that every human life is as potent and vivid as their own.

So keep reading. Your brain will work better. And you will be harder to manipulate. And you will be less alone. ",normal
"Malibu Rising by Taylor Jenkins Reid I recently finished *Malibu Rising* by Taylor Jenkins Reid, and... I‚Äôm honestly a bit underwhelmed. I went in with high expectations, especially after The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo but something about this one didn‚Äôt click. The story felt like it had potential, but the characters didn‚Äôt grab me the way I‚Äôd hoped, and the plot felt like it was missing some of the depth I expected.

"The Great Gatsby, why make highschoolers read this? I (35M) recently re-read this because a high-schooler I knew was forced to read it. I read this in high school.

I thought there was so much historical information that couldn't be appreciated by a young person unless they are hyper-focused on this specific era.

It also feels like this book glorifies things like infidelity, strong alcohol use, lying, etc. It brought me back to the days when I was drinking heavily. (Thankfully I'm sober now.)

There is some nice, flowery language, and there is a good vibe about the whole book. I enjoyed it. I feel there's got to be much better books to force children to read in high school.",normal
"How to get over book disappointment? Since booktok has blown up, even though I don't use tiktok, I'm hearing about all these amazing booktok books.

Book disappointment is what stopped me reading in the past, so I'm wondering how everyone else gets over bad books.

"Why do you think Murakami references brands by name every chance he gets? Murakami never says things like ""He pulled out a cigarette"", ""He poured himself a soda"" or ""we drove past a few burger joints"". He always says ""He pulled out a Marlboro"", ""He poured himself a Perrier"" and ""we drove past a few McDonalds"". In Kafka on the Shore, >!mascots become real characters who drive the plot like Johnnie Walker and the KFC Colonel!<. I've heard people say that it's some kind of critique of consumerism and Japan's loss of soul but to me at least it does not feel critical, it just feels acknowledged. If anything it sometimes feels elevated in a Warholian still-life sort of way. I'm not sure why he does that myself, but the effect it has on me as a reader is that it blurs the line between the book's universe and my universe. It's rare for books or movies to dwell so much on real brands so when it does happen it really anchors the universe to our reality and our everyday experience, which makes the bizare stuff that happens in his books feel more real. I remember watching a movie called ""Escape from Tomorrow"" (2013) which was filmed guerilla-style in Disneyland and there was a scene where >!the main character is tied up on a bed inside a spooky lab and is being experimented on by an android. The scene is generally pretty goofy and stereotypical but the fact that the lab is located inside a real attraction in Disneyland and that the android and the lab machines both have a large SIEMENS logo on them makes it really bizarre for me. It really felt like I was seeing real found footage from some kind of weird corporate conspiracy!<. Murakami's books produce a similar effect. But that's just me, what do you think?",normal

"How do you feel about authors continuing another author‚Äôs work after they‚Äôre gone?  This is a question that I had been thinking about lately and have been talking about with some friends of mine, so I thought I‚Äôd continue the conversation. 

I was recently reading Eruption, a novel that Michael Crichton started writing but was left unfinished at the time of his death. Years later, Crichton‚Äôs widow enlisted James Patterson to complete the book. 

That got me thinking of other instances where an author died and left a story unfinished (Charles Dickens, Robert E. Howard, V.C. Andrews, Robert B. Parker, just to name a few) and somebody came in and finished their story, trying to capture the same ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of the original author. 

The results (at least to me) mostly fall short, the work in question coming off as a disjointed mess. 

Or when an author will write a popular book series and then die and then the estate will hire another author to write new books in the series. I understand the desire to want to tell new stories in that narrative world and to not let the characters die, but much of the time the results come off like cheap fanfiction. 

However, there are to me those rare instances where it actually works but I‚Äôm curious to know what your thoughts are. ",normal
"What are some things that prevent you a little from enjoying a book? At what point will they stop you from reading?  There are things that prevent me from enjoying a book but will not stop me unless they keep recurring or become extreme. I will give you an example.

One is the various isms (racism, sexism, and the like). I think I have become desensitized to them from having read too many older books that were written at a time when these bigoted attitudes were the norm and many people were not aware of the damage that these stereotypical views caused. 

So now if I'm reading a contemporary crime novel and the detective is a bit of a macho guy and sexist, I continue reading, though feeling a little annoyed. But if I find that the detective is actually what the author believes and that the author is kind of hiding behind the character but has an agenda, I will stop.

What are some things that reduce your enjoyment but will not stop you from reading? And when do they become too much?

Can be about the plot, characters, and theme, but also the actual writing (vocabulary, grammar, dialect).",normal
"Flowers in the Attic Questions and Discussion I know there's previous posts on this book, but I got obsessed with it üòÖ

I found it so incredibly amazing, even though it really wasn't that great of a book. Plus the foreword completely spoiled it.

But holy shit, I really like that book. I really do. There's so many aspects that make it as good as it is.

The biggest one is that the kids are confined, but they're not necessarily forced to be there. They weren't kidnapped - they were tricked and lied to. As Chris and Cathy showed, they could've left at any time. Or at least a lot earlier than they did. (I'm sure they could've managed with the twins.)

That's the part that really gets me. I'm not blaming the children for their suffering, but I think it's wild that they REALLY could've left at any time after figuring out a way down. 

It was more of a psychological jail imo. Staying because they're under a delusion that they'll share their mother's inheritance 

Another part is that I think the section of my job is about as big as the attic would've been, and I think about how nuts it would be to stay there for three years. Since I have a personal reference, it makes the story more bewildering.

And the idea of there being children you don't know about in a house is so unsettling too üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

Corrine's character development was CRAZY. Because I'm sure she truly loved her late husband and family (because why would she initially give up her inheritance?), but as we can see from the first few chapters, she was planning on keeping the kids in the attic indefinitely.

Also, Bart.

But how could she do that??? I thought she genuinely loved those kids, and she never knew Christopher was going to die. So, if he didn't die, they'd just keep living the way they did?

After I finished the book, I kept having questions like that. Why did x happen/not happen? Why didn't something happen instead?

But it doesnt seem like one of those stories when there's a big plot hole; it seems like there could always be a reasonable explanation.

More Questions:

‚Ä¢ What did you think of Chris?

Personally, I thought he was annoying as hell, but I still like him. He was the main reason the kids didn't escape earlier. No good mother would be comfortable locking their kids in a room for even a few hours. So, after the first few days/weeks passed...He really should've caught on.

‚Ä¢ Why didn't Corrine put the kids in boarding school or foster care?

‚Ä¢ Why couldn't the kids find some agency/charity/organization to help them after they got out? I'm not sure why they decided to steal money instead.",normal
"Which book made you sympathize with a bad character? Or root for a good character making a morally questionable decision? For me, it was Flowers in the Attic. The whole time I was reading, I knew I should be against what Chris and Cathy were doing, but, due to their rare and terrible circumstances, or perhaps just because VC Andrews was such an amazingly gifted writer, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel sorry for them and even ended up rooting for their love story from the sidelines. The book had me feeling a bit guilty and questioning my own morals as I read it.  

Has anyone else ever had a similar experience or come across a book that made them empathize with characters who were doing something wrong/making horrible decisions?, or even led them to root for a straight up bad or shady character in general? If so, what was the book and what was the situation? Why did you sympathize with/root for them? ",normal
"Pocahontas and the English Boys, by Karen Kupperman The subtitle of this one is ""Caught between cultures in early Virginia.""  

Man.  What a book.  I haven't been this impressed with the scholarship level of a book since I read David Hackett Fischer's book Paul Revere's Ride, published in 1994.  The book - Pocahontas and the English Boys - basically took my brain, as far as anything was in it regarding early Virginia, and turned it inside out and gave it a good wash and a vigorous scrub.

I was trying to learn about slavery in early Virginia.  Why on earth did George Yeardley purchase those ""20. and Odd Negroes"" in 1619?  What did he think he was doing?  I emailed a well respected historian and haven't heard back.  Maybe it went straight to his spam folder, who knows.  And I did not learn much from this book about slavery in early Virginia.  As far as I could tell, slavery wasn't a part of any of these people's conceptions of the world between 1607 and 1617, which is basically when the book ends.

Although other sources claim that after John Smith left what was to become New England, in 1614, the ship commander he left behind promptly seized two dozen Indians and sold them as slaves in Spain.  Spain, of course, had been into the slave trade for much longer than England, and had made a LOT of money off it.

But anyway.  Did you know that in the 17th century, it was common for British sub-teenagers to be apprenticed out?  Now you know.  Apparently parents feared that their too strong attachments, to their kids, would prevent them from exercising the kind of discipline the kids really needed.  And it happened again and again that the Virginia colonists took youngsters of 11, 12, 13 years old and sent them off to live with the Indians.  Not to apprentice them out but so the Indians would raise them knowing the Indian languages, so that they would then be able to come back and help the colonists deal with the Indians.

And so the book basically follows the careers of some of these teenagers - and Pocahontas too, she was 10 years old when she was sent to live with the colonists for a little while.  The marriage with John Smith was all hocus, more of a kind of ""adoption"" of Smith into the Powhatan tribe.  Although her marriage with John Rolfe, later, was apparently real.

And tobacco!  I knew, as who did not, that tobacco was important in Virginia.  But no one ever told me before that tobacco was the whole reason the colony thrived, and the only thriving any of the colonies did for quite some time.  It was the discovery that tobacco could be produced much more cheaply in Virginia - not using slave labor yet, they hadn't started yet - and sold to the masses in Europe, that made the colonies a paying proposition for their backers in England.  Virginia tobacco, in the early 1600s (1619 to 1622) created a sensation in Europe.  People for whom tobacco had always been an unimaginable luxury suddenly could afford it, and found that they wanted to.  And that was what really got the colonies going.

And apparently - according to the book - it was the Indians that showed the British how to grow and cure tobacco!  It's not so easy.  You don't just throw a couple of seeds in the earth and hold your breath while they grow.  The Indians apparently took some care and some trouble to educate the British on just how it was done.

Unfortunately, the new tobacco craze inspired more and more and more to come to the colony.  They were planting tobacco in the streets of Jamestown.  And the massive influx of colonists, of course, demanded more and more land, and land wasn't quite as easy to come by as our high school history books implied.  There were Indians already on the land, and they had borders, and border conflicts, and power struggles just as the Europeans had.

Well, there's more - lots more - but it's all interesting.  Highly recommended.",normal

Hi all!! I find that when starting a new book I struggle to keep track of characters in the first 35% of the book. Has anyone come up with a good strategy to keep track of characters and quickly reference when a name pops up on a page? Are you guys making your own spreadsheets, jotting things down on a bookmark? 
Let me know! :P

"What‚Äôs the most disturbing book you‚Äôve ever read? Actually, let me rephrase that‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs the most disturbing book you‚Äôve ever managed to get through? Because I don‚Äôt mean disturbing like, ‚Äúdamn‚Ä¶ This is kind of messed up‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äô I mean disturbing like, ‚Äúthis is so fucked up that I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to finish it.‚Äô‚Äô The word disturbing can take on several different meanings. So you can interpret it however you‚Äôd like. But, to me, disturbing is something that either disgusts you, triggers you, makes you so angry that you want to cry, or rips your heart out in a way that makes you wanna launch the book across the room. But it‚Äôs almost as if there is some type of gravitational pull keeping your eyes glued to the pages.  

I‚Äôm 31 years old and have been reading since I was a child. I have come across very few books that have actually managed to disturb me. The first book I ever read that I found to be slightly disturbing was the lovely bones by Alice Sebold. I read it when I was only 16 years old, so, back then, it was pretty messed up. It became one of my favorite books of all time though, hands-down,. Now that I am an adult, I think two of the most disturbing books I have ever read are Tampa by Alyssa nutting and My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell.  

I‚Äôm only halfway through Tampa right now and honestly, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm gonna be able to finish it. The protagonist is, without a doubt, the most sociopathic MC I have ever come across.  

My Dark Vanessa, however, is one of the most disturbing, yet beautifully heart wrenching portrayals of trauma that I have ever read in my life. I would almost bet money that Kate Elizabeth Russell has been through something similar herself. Otherwise, I don‚Äôt see any way she would be able to capture it so brilliantly. In my opinion, it truly is a literary masterpiece.  

So, what about y‚Äôall? What‚Äôs the most disturbing book you‚Äôve ever managed to get through? What made it so disturbing? What ultimately made you decide to keep reading? How did you feel about the book as a whole once it was through? Would you be interested in ever rereading it? Feel free to add any other comments you deem necessary. I‚Äôd love to read your thoughts/opinions!",normal

"The Midnight Library was not the best...but it wasn't the worst either When I was younger (say 12-13 years old) I had read ""A Boy called Christmas"" by Matt Haig. Since then it has become one of my most beloved books and I have read it many times. One year ago I noticed that another book by the same author was gaining more popularity and that was none other than The Midnight Library. I was intrigued by the plot and the mixed reviews and I decided to keep an eye on it for the future. Last Christmas my sister gifted it to me but due to high school exams, I wasn't able to read it - until now.

I'll start by saying that although the book did not meet all of my expectations, I was not disappointed. Truth be said, I expected to like it more than I did but it didn't leave a bad taste on me once I was done reading it. Is it overhyped. Most likely yes? Did I enjoy it? Also yes. I think that it's good that I read it now, because had I read it sooner, when my excitement over it was higher, I would be more disappointed.

From the very first pages, I was hooked by the plot. We get to see Nora's life, how miserable she feels and how she has given up on life. Once Nora enters the midnight library after she attempts to kill herself, we witness her journey to find the perfect life for her. She is not alone. In the library she finds Mrs Elm, the old librarian from her old school. With her help she tries to navigate through the millions possible lives she could live in. But what is the best way to live?

I found the concept of the book very imaginative. I haven't read any books like this before and the system was very unique too. Just imagine how interesting it would be if we had the opportunity to travel to all of the different lives we might have lived! How different our path would be if we did even the smallest change in our life. Matt Haig did a good job crafting this magic system and for the most part, I enjoyed following Nora in her different paths.

The book did a good job exploring Nora's regrets and sadness. At the beginning it's clear that Nora is suffocated by her guilt and desperation. She regrets the things she did and the things she didn't do. She feels like she has wasted her life and isolated by almost everyone, she doesn't find a reason to live anymore. Her past haunts her continuously and in the library, she finds the chance to undo her mistakes and live her life differently. However, she quickly realises that what sounded so wonderful in her head was not what she made it out to be. Most of her biggest regrets were because she didn't get to fullfil other people's wishes. Her father's dream to see her become a great competitive swimmer. Her ex-fiance's dream to open a pub in the country. Her brother's dream to become a famous musician. And the list goes on.

Throughout her life, Nora was focused on trying to please the people around her. The dreams she didn't get to fullfil were never her own. Of course she found enjoyment in some things, like studying philosophy, playing music or swimming. But most of her goals were guided by others' desires. She never got to have her own ambitions. Instead of following her own path, she tries to live up to the expectations of others - and ultimately fail. But that changes as she travels in her other lives. She accepts that she can't undo her past. She accepts her own regrets. And she finally finds enjoyment in living. She doesn't seek death and she wants to live instead. But there is one question: what could her best possible live be?

For the most part, I enjoyed reading about the different lives of Nora. It was interesting to see how different the outcome would be had she made different decisions. Although I didn't fully connect with Nora, I felt sympathy for her, especially at the beginning. I could understand her frustation and worries and I really wanted her to find the best life. I also enjoyed seeing her growth and how she came to appreciate herself and value.

The writing was good. It was simple and at times, it was quite lyrical. Some parts made me laugh, some made me angry and some others made me sad. There were many quotes that resonated with me and made me pause and rethink about my choices and life. In some parts, the book felt bittersweet and overall, it brought me comfort while reading it. It was cheesy, I know. But I still enjoyed it.

I appreciated the theme around the ""meaning"" of life and how we define success. By pursuing success and by being driven by egoistical motives, we start to lose ourselves. We are trying to give a meaning to our lives, to find our purpose in this world and by doing so, we're starting to stop appreciating life for what it is. We are not able to see the forest for the trees and we underestimate the importance of the little things that are making as feel happy and content. And as the book says:

>*Never underestimate the importance of small things.*

There have been times in my life when I too have felt remorse for some of the things I have or haven't done. I have felt remorse for getting a bad grade when I knew I could study more and do better. I have felt remorse for fighting with my sister over something insignificant. I have felt remorse for saying bad things to my mom during a heated argument. True, compared to Nora or other people's regrets, mine may seem unimportant. But at the time, they still made me feel bad and I wished I could change them. However, as time went on, I have come to accept that I can't change the past. What I should do instead is try to develop more as a person and live my life in the fullest. It sounds cliche. I know. But it's something which is worth to remember. It's pointless to try and change our past decisions, no matter how we feel about them. What we can do is learn from our mistakes and try to fix them. Yes life can be bleak. And it's not going to be easy to just get over our hardships. But there is a possibility of a better future, if we manage to take matters in our own hands. To seize our own day.

As much as I enjoyed reading the book, as I already mentioned above, it wasn't exactly what I expected. This is one of the cases when the author has a good idea but the execution is lackluster. The concept of the book was very good and unique. It could be better, though. At one point, the plot became quite repetitive. Nora's lives followed the same structure and during the middle of the novel, they became quite predictable and monotonous. I still had fun while reading them but I was quite close at skimming some parts. I think that it would have been nice if we had more chapters like the first ones, before Nora entered the library. There was much telling and not showing when it came to her past and the relationship with her family and while that was not necessarily bad, it would have been more effective if they were presented in a different way. 

The plot would have definitely benefitted from more action, especially during the middle. Although the book was fast-paced, at one point I stopped caring a little because I knew that nothing remarkable would happen. The plot twists in Nora's lives lost their charm and the story was going around in circles. I would have prefered it if the book had focused in fewer lives and if some themes had been explored more.

The characterisation in this book was quite bland. The only character I got to know better was of course Nora but even she wasn't that fleshed out. Of course the book describes her worries, her struggles with her mental health, her developement. I sympathised with her, I felt proud of her developement but overall, I didn't have strong feelings about her as a person. She was read like a shell of a person at times. She would live a different life, realize that she didn't like it, have a short conversation with Mrs Elm and conclude that she had been wrong about what would be the best for her. Her journey to self reflection could have been handled better and she could have. As for the rest of the characters...well, they were kinda forgettable. Mrs. Elm was the typical type of character who is there to give advices to the main characters and be a mentor to them. And I couldn't bring myself to care for the rest of the others.

When it came to the writing, although it was good, it became kinda corny with all of these deep and intellectual quotes. I understand what Haig's goal was and as I already said, many of them made me think a lot. But they could have been toned out. At one point, I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again and despite the warm feelings it caused me, it was quite boring and surface-level. 

Despite my criticism of the novel, I still found it enjoyable and thought-provoking. The ending made me cry a little and I finished the book with a smile on my face. Granted, it was not the best book I've ever read but it was okay and I by no means regret reading it. It was a very cozy autumn read and I could see myself revisiting it in the future if I wanted to read something light-hearted and easy-going. I wouldn't recommend it as a life-changing read but I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it. After all, books are unpredictable. You don't know what you will like unless you'll try it. Just like most of the things we're doing in our life.

So, The Midnight Library didn't change my mindset. But it made me re-value my life and it encouraged me to continue to live in the best way I can. I might not now what is going to happen tomorrow, in one week or in a few years. But one thing is certain:

"Why there is so much (sudden) death in contemporary fiction?  I just finished ‚ÄòHello Beautiful‚Äô by Ann Napolitano, and whereas I found this book exceptionally beautiful and well-written (and myself sobbing endlessly throughout the last 30 pages), I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder: why there is death everywhere nowadays when it comes to fiction? I mean, I *know* death is inevitable part of our existence but it feels like sudden death of a character is a thing often used in contemporary fiction. I mean, from some point at the beginning I already knew one of the sisters would die unexpectedly (once again, I KNOW it‚Äôs an homage to Little Women and it was mentioned in the book), but it‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôm encountering this. 

What are your thoughts on this? Do you think it‚Äôs made just for the sake of making readers ‚Äòfeel more‚Äô? Maybe happy endings are a cliche nowadays already?",normal
"Dune Just finished Dune, the first book. I have had it on my list of ""to read"" since a long time ago. I had seen the movies, not the series, so somewhat of a spoiler there.

I thought it was mostly an easy read, with a bit of over explaining on some points and others just throws you into the scene with no advanced warning (beginning fo chapters).

I enjoyed the book overall, although I found the ending of the first book somewhat of a letdown. I think there should have been a bit more to it. My opinion only, but wanted to share it, as I've been getting into reading again in my old age from when I was a teenager. ",normal
"Have you ever taken a library book on vacation with you? I went back and forth about it before I went on a trip last month. I didn't want to lose it or risk damaging it. But I was in the middle of the book and didn't want to have to wait so long before continuing it. 

I grabbed the book at the last minute and I'm glad I did. I wound up reading some of it several evenings and it made a nice memory. Nothing bad happened to the book, and on the contrary, it came in handy. I pressed a leaf in it and brought it home as a souvenir!

"What is magical realism? I have a theory that books fall on a spectrum of magical realism instead of just being an either or situation. I‚Äôve been very interested in this genre of books for a while now but I‚Äôve only been able to read just one or two books in that category. This is because of how challenging it is to truly grasp books with magical realism. It‚Äôs such a unique art form to be able bridge the normal and abnormal and I will always appreciate that. I realised that it can be so ambiguous to define magical realism though. For example, while many people view Babel as fantasy, I think it‚Äôs magical realism (having that perspective made me enjoy the book more tbh). I have always thought of The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka as magical realism as well as Before The Coffee gets cold. Even The Secret History had hints of magical realism. i think my idea of magical realism is quite broad. But that‚Äôs why I want to know, when does a book leave the sci-fi and fantasy realm and become magical realism? Of course I can google this, but I also want to have a discussion on this, plus google‚Äôs answers aren‚Äôt very satisfactory

edit: typos

"Babel by RF Kuang is sooo impressive  
I‚Äôm only 19 percent into this book, but I‚Äôm already having a total brain orgasm! The research and detail in this book are something I‚Äôve never encountered before. Well, granted, I haven‚Äôt been reading much until this year, but damn, this book is so good!

I started with Yellowface, which was seriously addictive. The pacing is on point, and getting into the villain‚Äôs head is just so satisfying. Plus, the discussions it brings up are fantastic.

But Babel? Wow, it‚Äôs even better. The way it delves into language and translation really shows off her academic background. I have to admit, I kind of simp for her‚Äîespecially after seeing her interviews about Yellowface. She‚Äôs so articulate, but Babel has really blown me away even more. The details, the imagery, the characters‚Äîthey‚Äôre all so interesting!

"How do you guys feel about unreliable narrators?? Personally, I have mixed emotions about them. In some cases, the author can make it work. For example: Gone Girl by Jillian Flynn. The diary entries were a great way to pull it off. She meant for the diary to be found, which is why she was pretending to be something she wasn‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs something like that, it tends to work well. Letters to another person, or if something happened to make the narrator unreliable. A mental illness or a head injury for instance. What I don‚Äôt like, however, is when they are unreliable for absolutely no reason at all. Like, when the ending comes, and it‚Äôs completely unbelievable because the narrator has been one person throughout the entire book all the way up until the end and then they have a complete personality switch out of nowhere. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. One book that does this is You Shouldn‚Äôt Have Come Here by Geneva Rose. It‚Äôs written in the style of Gone Girl. The book switches back-and-forth between the perspectives of two different narrators, male/female. We are put into the minds of both individuals throughout the book, then at the end, the unexpected twist comes, and suddenly they are no longer who we thought they were at all. But there‚Äôs no reason for the random personality  shift whatsoever. it comes totally out of nowhere and is just extremely unbelievable/unrealistic. It‚Äôs almost as if the author were in a hurry to finish the book, and just completely changed her characters into totally different people and scribble down some random ending for the sake of finishing the book. There‚Äôs no foreshadowing or any type of clues leading up to the twist at all. I don‚Äôt like this. It left me with a lot of confusion and unanswered questions. How do you guys feel about unreliable narrators? In your opinion, when do they work and when do they not? Feel free to provide examples for both. Books where the author makes it work, and books where they don‚Äôt.  

Note: I only ask to provide examples so that I can see what your idea of a good unreliable narrator is versus a bad one. That is not a recommendation/suggestion request. Examples are not necessary. I would just like to know how y‚Äôall feel about unreliable narrators in general. I hope this post doesn‚Äôt get removed because of the last sentence!!  

Edit: after another person mentioned it in the comments below, I would like to add that another type of unreliable narrator I happen to enjoy is one that has a distorted view of reality for some reason. For instance: they are extremely immature or self-centered, they are paranoid, they are being gaslighted by someone important to them, etc. One major example I can think of is My Dark Vanessa by Kate Elizabeth Russell. The teenage protagonist, Vanessa, is being gaslighted by her teacher who is 27 years older than her. She is so traumatized and blinded by his gaslighting that she thinks they are in love. She doesn‚Äôt realize that he is a predator who has groomed her to fall in love with him. she is so unreliable, in fact, that we as the reader actually believe it‚Äôs love as well until we start to see the truth about midway through the book. Sadly, though, Vanessa doesn‚Äôt realize it until the end.",normal
"With the elections only a few days away, what are your favorite political fiction/nonfiction books? I'm using the word political very loosely so don't look for books that are strictly about politics. It's fine as long as it has something to do with government, social power and status (e.g., racism, sexism), distribution of money or other resources (e.g., poverty), war and terror, and things like that. 

You can mention nonfiction too but here's a list of political thrillers:

And a Wiki page on political fiction:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political\_fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_fiction)

For me, I'll go with nonfiction. A favorite of mine is The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Didn't really know much about him at all before a friend urged me to a read it. Reading the book you get to know him and watch his gradual transformation. You get to see how this contentious figure came to be who he is. The narration is so fascinating and well-written.

"I read a paranormal romance series about mermaids that got way more intense than I thought it would. So one of my secret interests is mermaids and I recently stumbled upon a long running mermaid romance series of books called ""Merman's Kiss"" on Kindle. (Just for clarity since there are two books with the same name, I'm talking about the series by Dee. J Stone)

It's a pretty long series. The first book came out in 2014 and from what I can tell, it's still going on to this day, with multiple spin offs and the latest book in the series released last January.

So I decided, wanting a nice mermaid book to read to try going into the series.

The first book was mostly what I expected. A nice simple romance piece with the conflict coming from mostly character drama. It's pretty clich√© but in that endearing way you can't help but like.

Then I read the second book. The stakes escalated a bit, especially with a major moment of mood whiplash, but other than that it seemed pretty standard.

And then the third book happened. And that's the point where the story went off the rails. In a good way.

I don't wanna spoil it but there's a major plot twist during the third book involving the main girl's father and MAN things get intense and crazy after that. Complete with heartbreaking results in the fourth book.

I know I'm being very unspecific here, but that's just because I don't wanna risk spoiling it. Because it really is best if you go in blind. Maybe it was just me but the whole book kept me so on the edge of my seat, that I couldn't stay in. I was walking and pacing while reading from my kindle the whole time. I couldn't take my eyes off it.

I'm aware paranormal romance isn't everyone thing, and it does get a little sickening sweethearts at times (It doesn't get explicit but there's a *lot* of focus on the two leads make out sessions when they can) but if you don't mind a little spice and thriller in your romance, maybe give this series a shot.",normal
"I'm convinced Stephen King doesn't know anything about kids/teens anymore I'll preface by saying I'm a guy nearing 40, but I just finished listening to Under the Dome. I enjoyed it for the most part, but throughout I became more and more convinced King just can't write relatable kid/teen characters anymore. Some might argue that he's always had trouble (infamous IT scene as a glaring example), but after so many 1930-50s-type references coming from kids' mouths I just started rolling my eyes.

One kid makes a ""this is another nice mess you got me in,"" jab at another like it's something people do every day, which is from 1930s Laurel and Hardy. Another instance has a teen casually saying something like, ""like Lon Chaney dancing with the Queen,"" either from the 1941 The Wolf Man movie or more likely the 1970s Werewolves of London song.

Maybe I'm wrong, but do kids and teens know Laurel and Hardy references? Was The Wolf Man or Waren Zevon still on some people's radar like it's second nature when Obama was president (which is when the book takes place)?

Just wanted to rant, because it's the biggest thing that kept taking me out of the story to Google references to understand where these kids got their lingo.",normal
"The space trilogy  Well I just finished CS Lewis‚Äô Space Trilogy and I‚Äôm gonna post my review here.

First of all, out of the silent planet was a fantastic book. Lewis truly is a master at being able to paint an image in your head as far as his description goes. I am still fascinated at the moment ‚Äúman meets foreign creature‚Äù. Not only that, but the way that these creatures lived. I legit laughed during this book as one of the antagonists tried to talk to a complex and superior being like he was a threat and superior himself. If I could sum up the book in one word, ‚Äúprovidence‚Äù.

Secondly, we have Perelandraz. Again, Lewis paints a whole new world that I got to experience. This one isn‚Äôt as much about discovery as it is action. This one mirrors the serpent in the garden, an attempt on another destruction of Eden. This books makes you want to go out and punch a demon. 

Lastly and my favorite, That hideous strength. What a fantastic read. This one wasn‚Äôt in a foreign planet, it is based on Earth. A battle of good and evil. It parallels a lot of what happens today as far as what happens inside of education institutions. The tones of Gnosticism in here aren‚Äôt easy to miss. The head sputtering like an engine was absolutely terrifying to me. The scene where ransom and Merlin speak I with angels was my favorite! And the dinner scene was pure chaos. 

I highly recommend this. Lewis was a genius. I‚Äôve been looking for a light hearted read in between my serious studies, and this one is exactly the cozy one I was looking for. It is advertised as a fairy tale for grownups, and it absolutely is.",normal
"Just finished ‚ÄúWar‚Äù by Bob Woodward I‚Äôm not generally a political reader, but Woodward really did a great job here. I was most impressed with his simple wording when describing complex topics. And the characters felt real and well-rounded, even though they are obviously real people.

Overall, I was so impressed that I may start reading some of his other works. War did not feel academic at all; it was just a page-turner.

"Clarification on *Klara and the Sun* by Kazuo Ishiguro Really enjoying the novel so far, but just struggled with pages 30 through 34. Understand the broad strokes of what is happening (ie Klara is still learning to interpret the world around her) but I cannot for the life of me understand what Ishiguro is describing with regards to the following:

>We were then facing the store, and I could see all the way to the Glass Table at the back, but the space had become partitioned into ten boxes, so that I no longer had a single unified picture of the view before me. The front alcove was in the box furthest to my right, as might be expected; and yet the magazines table, which was nearest the front alcove, had become divided between various boxes, so that one section of the table could even be seen in the box furthest to my left. By now the lights had been dimmed, and I spotted the other AFs in the backgrounds of several boxes, lining the walls mid-store, preparing for their sleep. But my attention was drawn to the three center boxes, at that moment containing aspects of Manager in the act of turning towards us. In one box she was visible only from her waist to the upper part of her neck, while the box immediately beside it was almost entirely taken up by her eyes. The eye closest to us was much larger than the other, but both were filled with kindness and sadness. And yet a third box showed a part of her jaw and most of her mouth, and I detected there anger and frustration. Then she had turned fully and was coming towards us, and the store became once more a single picture.

and 

>When I next looked, the street outside had become partitioned into several vertical panels - from my position I could see three of them quite clearly without leaning forward. The amount of dark smoke appeared to vary from panel to panel, so that it was almost as if contrasting shades of gray were being displayed for selection. But even where the smoke was at its most dense, I could still pick out many details. In one panel, for instance, there was a section of the overhaul men's wooden barrier, and seemingly now attached to it, the front part of a taxi. In the neighboring panel, diagonally cutting off its top corner, was a metal bar which I recognized as belonging to one of the high traffic signals.

Any help would be appreciated. Is this explained later on, am I missing a fairly basic idea, or is it just a description of her 'machine' eyes? Presumably these boxes or partitions aren't real?",normal
"I finished Titanicus, and I have to talk about it (no spoilers) *I miss writing on this subreddit about the books I have recently finished, I used to do it so much a few years back, and discussing these books with other people always made me happy*

  
So, That Title isn't very commonly known unless you're part of the Warhammer 40k Lore Community. 

  
Titanicus is a book from the Black Library, written by Dan Abnett (a famous 40k writer), about the Collegia Titanica, specifically the Legio Invicta. They're, in the simplest most crude terms, Giant War Machines that wage wars for the imperium of mankind. The book is split between different POVs from the simple inexperienced army officer to the captain of a task force, and from the leader of the forge world under attack, to my favorite character in the entire book, Lord Gearheart: The Red Fury, and the main Princeps (Driver/ CPU) of the main war machine (yes, they fuse humans with war machines).

If you've never read 40k lore, this might seem very strange and incoherent, but this is the perfect chance to get into it. The world-building is immaculate, there are different POVs from various characters, the action is fierce and impeccable, and the climax leaves nothing to be desired (except for a certain person).

You will struggle a little bit in understanding what most words mean, but just google them and open ""images"" and it'll explain itself fairly quickly.   
  
This is my first time reading a 40k book that doesn't have Astartes and Space Marines in it.   
I didn't enjoy the multiple POVs much because I just wanted to follow Gearhart, but it was alright in the end.  
  
Again, if you want to get into this world, either read Helsreach or Titanicus; World sieges are amazing in this universe. ",normal

"Reading a book quickly or slowly This year I decided to read a lot more than in the past, often finishing a book in a couple days, however there are a few books I've really taken my time with. One such book is Anna Karenina. I am slowly making my through, often only reading it one or two days out of the week, and I can honestly say I am retaining the information much better and enjoying the experience more! It has allowed me to really live in the space of the book and take my time digesting and mulling over what I am reading.

On the other hand, the books which I've sped through are often forgotten a day after I've finished. I'm now trying to actively think about and analyze the books I'm reading, especially those which I finish in a few days.

Overall, I can say that for me, reading simply to get my numbers up or reach a goal is preposterous and unneccessary, and frankly not as rewarding. Reading should be enjoyable and leisurely.

"A World Transformed, by James Walvin The subtitle of the book is:  ""Slavery in the Americas and the Origins of Global Power.""  An awe-inspiring title, unfortunately not lived up to by the text!  Well, it would have to be 800 pages long to do the job right, right?  So that's not such an important complaint.  Moving right along.

The thing is... you see... the book is kind of sold as a scholarly effort.  That's how it's presented to browsers \[people who browse, that is, not internet discovery tools lol\], who pick it up wondering what to think.  A sober cover, nothing too dramatic in the blurbs, and apparently the author actually works as a Professor of History, or did in 2008, when the book was published.  And that's kind of misleading.  The book is actually semi-scholarly slavery porn, is what it is.

Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course!

And parts of the book really are valuable. I feel that the author's footnotes, for example, justifying this or that statement of his, probably are actually valuable references.  I've made a long list and I expect them to be scholarly works. Who knows, right?  I've been wrong before.

The author really does make a fairly good case that slavery has underpinned the whole Western project since 1500 or so.  He gives a lot of information that tends in that direction.  He lists the industries to which slavery was important, in the expansion of their global reach, and it's a significant list.  Sugar.  Tobacco.  Coffee.  Cocoa.  Dyes.  Rice.  Cotton.  Guano.  (Guano?  Guano.)  Lumber.  Rubber.  Textiles.  Rum.  Cowries.  (Cowries?  Cowries.)

He really does make a good point when he says that slavery provided a firm and lasting foundation for the ideal of civilization.  It wasn't a connection any of those who worked toward this ideal noticed, but it was a real connection.  Civility was something that certain people could afford.  It wasn't obvious that you could have that without a certain financial base, and it wasn't obvious what that financial base rested on, in many if not most cases.  So this is a good point, by the author.

And he really does make a good point when he notices that the only people who have been repaid, for slavery, were the owners of the slaves.  Britain in particular invested a great deal of money in paying the owners back for the slaves of whom they had been deprived, when abolition finally lowered its political boom on the island.  France did its level best to make Haiti pay for every single one of those who were liberated.

And he really does make another very good point when he points out just how many British benefited by these payments.  There were many British who had a significant ownership interest in slaves.  These people were compensated.

Where the book fails, most of all, is in its promise.  It seems to promise history, and instead it provides peeks.  Glimpses.  Vignettes.  What were the values of those industries that I mentioned, up above, and how did their values change over time, on a global scale?  How did their values compare to the values of other industries?  He doesn't seem to think the question is interesting.  What was the effect of the Atlantic slave trade on Africa?  He barely mentions the subject.  What is the difference between what we think of as slavery, and other related labor situations, like debt bondage, sexual slavery, serfdom et cetera?  Not his concern.  How much of the impetus to slavery was profit, and how much was religious strife, or nationalistic competition, or war, or local or not so local politics, or status, or who knows what?  Not his concern.  How did the Atlantic slave trade compare to the Islamic slave trade?  Who knows.

It's interesting to me that his poster child for reasons people got into slavery is that some industry or other wasn't profitable without it, and yet he doesn't discuss the economic consequences of ending slavery at all.  To me this is a notable failure.  But among so many others, you know, it hardly stands out.

So, you know... interesting, but not really valuable.  Not essential.

"The Last Days of Mankind by Karl Kraus While reading the autobiographies of Elias Canetti, (which were some of the best books I've ever read BTW) he kept mentioning his undying devotion to Karl Kraus whom he would attend his seminars and readings in Vienna during the 20s and this was the first of Kraus's books that I've picked up to far.  

From what I've looked into it, a lot of the scenes depicted in the story were documented in real time so all the dialogue and characters were inspired by the people and events Kraus himself had to go through when the 'War to end all Wars' was wrecking shop.  It was fascinating to see how people put so much effort in justifying what their government was trying to do to the point of absolute terror of disobedience, as if they would rather die then see their government fail to deliver their promises, you get to see all walks of life have to go through this environment refusing to admit that things are not okay, or doing so and getting told off by someone.  My favorite parts of the were the prologue and the epilogue, Kraus has a fascinating way of coming to terms that the world he was born into really let him down with out ever refusing himself his own sense of humor, and the final speech by the Grumbler was one of my favorite passages in any book, every time he and The Optimist showed up was something I looked forward to.  It's sad that these conversations and these events are most likely being played out again just over 100 years later.

Anywho, if anyone else has read it then I'd love to know your opinions.  ",normal

"What do you think a winter book should be? I just woke up, went to the window and saw the first snow of the year. And I thought, what should be the winter book? 

After all, in order for the book to be exactly winter, you need not just to take a winter holiday and the time of the winter action, but something more. 

In the horror genre, it's mostly when people who have been skiing hide from a snowstorm in an old hut in the woods. In the thriller genre, it's always something about survival with the risk of death from the cold or about hungry wolves that come very close to homes from hunger. In romance, it's always something naive and kind where the climax is either on New Year's Eve or Valentine's Day. Detectives are usually something about a robbery/theft/murder in a mansion on New Year's Eve. 

In short, there are a lot of cliche tropes, but I have bad taste and I like them. I consider such books to be valuable, but this is just my opinion and preference. What is a winter book for you?",normal

"Which novel in a series feels like a fuck you letter to the fans? Last novel of the Witcher Saga really dropped in quality. 

 That story peaked in the penultimate book The Tower of the Swallow >!when Geralt was searching for missing Ciri, and was companions with Dandelion, Cahir, Emiel Regis and Milva. And also the set up of Emhyr var Emreis as the main villain before we know who he is. Bounty hunter Leo Bonhart and his search for Ciri was just epic as well.

"Less than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis At first I thought Less than Zero was weird. While I know that a lot of people like the bored or ""empty"" attitude of the main character, Clay, but honestly I just found it vapid. I can't help but project his apathy onto myself while reading the book but Clay is not bored he's nearly a sociopath. 

After finishing it now I think the premise is just goofy. For 66% of the book Clay, just goes to forgettable parties, does coke, and while being a closeted homosexual(Kinda mad the Griffin plot point didn't get a resolution), yet all of that is immensely uninteresting as clay basically has no complex thoughts about it. Perhaps this was Ellis's goal for us the readers to feel the blending of time that clay feels as he goes through the meaningless interactions but that makes it really hard for me to care about the characters enough so when we get to the really crazy stuff it kinda comes outta nowhere. 

The last third is when shit really hits the fan and Clay actually has to contend with his and his friends questionable life choices in an extremely climatic way. Really woke me the fuck up before ending let me down by pulling a ""the city....."".

I remembered the books having a lot of cliffhanger moments, but this is kind of getting ridiculous. It feels like every other chapter in these books ends with mention of a new dangerous creature coming for the main characters.or a new god that is so powerful and coming for the main characters. I'm tempted to flip back through and count. I'm on book 3 cause I'm trying to push through so I can know how it all ends, but I'm losing steam.    
They just mentioned ANOTHER god of power. And another name drop right before the end of a chapter.   
If Dee, the main antagonist, is described as desperate and thus willing to ask a super dangerous uncontrollable bad guy for help one more time, I don't know if I can handle it.  
Also, thinking further, there is constant flip flop in danger, despite situations not really changing. Characters are so terrified, and then solve the problem in moments. Then terrified again from a new monster that they identify breathless with fear! And then it's defeated. And then again and again. Always terrified and then the new monster is solved.",normal
"This Is How It Always Is by Laurie Frankel - thoughts from trans folks? I just read this book and although I am a LGBTQ person I'm not trans. I thought it was OK once I got past certain things (i.e. part of it takes place in a place where i used to live, and the author maybe has never been there, lol). It centers around the parents of a trans child. The author is the parent of a trans child. Many reviews exist online from parents of trans children. But i can't find any reviews from trans folks to see any of their thoughts. I am curious about it because I know too well how easily the voices of the ""parents of"" group can drown out and undermine the voices of those with that identity. 

Any thoughts on how to find those kinds of reviews, in case i can't find them here on reddit? It's hard to Google because the search terms just keep understandably yielding reviews from parents of trans kidsrather than trans people themselves. 

(Editing to add - i know that trans folks are not a monolith and there's going to be varying perspectives. My search is for trans voices in addition to the cis voices that I'm reading in reviews.)",normal
"Continuing the odyssey: Arthur C. Clarke's ""2010: Odyssey Two"". So now I'm picking right back up on Clarke's Odyssey series, and now I've just finished the second book.

Taking place at least nine years after the failure of the 2001 Discovery mission to the planet Jupiter, a new mission, a joint effort between the US and the Soviets, has been created and sent on a rendezvous course with the now derelict Discovery. The object of this new mission: to search the memory banks of HAL 9000, the mutinous computer, and find out what went wrong.

However a Chinese expedition has the same objective, and now it has turned into a race to gain that information that Discovery has about the strange monolith that orbits Jupiter.

But meanwhile a being that was once David Bowman, the man who had unlocked the monolith's mystery, is now on its own mission, one that is very vital.

Clarke must've been asked a lot of times if he was ever going to write a sequel to the first one, which was published in the late sixties. And, eventually, in 1982 he would finally deliver.

It really feels like a sequel, even though with a new set characters, in a lot of ways. Of course one that takes place a few years after the first novel. Both books numbers one and two aren't heavily action oriented and can be dry at times, I get this massive sense of wonder from both of them. It's just that fantastic! Sure the books can be slow at times but it doesn't really subtract how good they both are!

The first book acts a, kind of, set up with ""2010"" simply continuing forward on the whole trip. Though a lot of people will have qualms about a book series, especially with concerns about the quality of the subsequent sequels with certain series, once I get on a series, I just really want to keep going!  I still have the final two books that I need to finish, just to see how it will all play out and what wonders are still waiting to be seen!",normal

"I reread ‚ÄòThe Alchemist‚Äô by Paulo Coelho after six year and was surprised.  Pretty interesting experience I thought I‚Äôd share. The first time I read the alchemist I was 16 because a friend had suggested it to me as a book that ‚Äòalways helps her when she is depressed.‚Äô I got through it, but as a non-religious person I really struggled to get through its religiousness and fairy tale language. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I liked the magical atmosphere, but the philosophy seemed a bit simple and idyllic. At the time the book did not help me understand the world better, instead I did not see any grounds for me to take the book as anymore truthful than believing in any other fairy tale or religious text. I put it away and did not reflect any further. 

Six years later, everything in my life looks different and I am 22. When packing my stuff to move my mind wondered to The Alchemist, which I haven‚Äôt thought about in years and I was overcome with a sudden urge to re read it. I took it with me and it has been one of the more impactful books for me in the last year. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was so caught up in the religiousness or magic of it anymore and I really missed reading something as easily digestible. The message I got is that you should simply leave your house. Bad things can happen anyway, but great things can only happen if you at least leave your comfort place. I suppose I always had a personal belief that the whole universe and the information in it neutral until the observer interprets it to be otherwise. I also find that many classics, including ones I love and respect tend to colour the world as a hostile place that directly conspires against the protagonist. It was nice to read a story which took the opposite stance. I reflected on all the  things that happened to me since the last time I have read the book and found parallels at every corner. 

I thought this was an interesting experience because I often hear the opposite to be true, the alchemist is impactful for children/teens but adults see it to be more naive and silly. I am interested to know if anyone had a similar experience as me, or perhaps the reverse.",normal

Reading on a kindle has been strangely helpful so I mainly read books on there now, however, I wanted to read the Stormlight Archive (I'm on book 2 now lol) and I own the chunky mass market paperback editions, which are on my bookshelf (physical bookshelf just fyi). 
I borrowed the audiobook from the library (since it's free you know lol) and I let it play while having the book out in front of me. I was shocked at how easier it was for me to digest the story and follow along without getting distracted.

"Do you browse for books in your dreams? I can‚Äôt be the only one who just woke up from a vivid dream about books‚Ä¶

I was wandering a college campus and visited various libraries. Walking by the shelves, certain covers catch my eye. I handle the books, flipping through to read passages or look at pictures. I‚Äôll place it back on the shelf or sometimes give it to a person in the dream. 

This isn‚Äôt the first time dreaming about browsing or shopping for books. More often, I‚Äôm browsing in a shopping mall or antique market and the only places I enter are book stores. 

Sometimes I am aware that it‚Äôs a dream, and deliberately place the books back on the shelves and wish they would exist. None of the books I find are real, remembered titles or authors, but always real subjects of interest. 

Am I just a book nerd? Could it be genetic memory? A YDNA researcher matched and traced my family name to one of the first book binders appointed at the University of Cambridge Press in 1534 - a Flemish immigrant known for publishing Erasmus and operated one of the first book shops on the British Isles. I even dreamt of being there, once.

"My local community put little free libraries next to all the schools, and seeing the difference between the high income areas and low income is heartbreaking. The nicest ones are always full of new looking books and even candy to encourage kids to look inside. One of them near me gets so many nice donations that the caretaker put a bench next to it that you can open and place books into. Usually the bench is also full of nice books.

I kind of appointed myself to take care of the one near my daughter's school because most of the students are low income (a ""Title 1"" school in legal terms), but in a blue collar way. The box is often disorganized. The children are like vultures when there are actually good books in there. I cleaned it out and while the box was mostly empty, there was crumpled paper in there, someone's old birthday cards, chewed up board books, and there are *always* evangelical prayer books, bibles, tracts, etc because apparently the box is someone's mission field. I carefully time my donations to the box to be shortly before school lets out so that books like Captain Underpants will get snatched up by the kids instead of by someone with a religious agenda.

When I drive downtown (~10 minutes from my house), to an area that has mostly black students, the little free library is empty. The layer of dust on the shelves is undisturbed, and there are cobwebs. There has also been a debacle recently where a library branch had to close completely during the hours immediately after school lets out because the school district doesn't provide bussing, so while waiting for the city bus, kids would go into the library. I saw with my own eyes that there were many kids doing homework. But there were also kids causing the elevator to lock up by jumping in it, vandalizing things and starting fist fights. The potential bookworms there have few opportunities to develop their love of literature because of all this.

I guess I'm just posting to encourage people with extra children's books to consider diverting a bit out of the way to find a sad empty little free library to fill. There is a ""last chance"" Goodwill near me that takes unsold items from other thrift stores and sells them by the pound. I rummaged around there this week and found a lot of good books! Goosebumps, the box car kids, A Series of Unfortunate Events, and a copy of The Hunger Games all went into a little free library and are probably already gone. I paid $0.89 per pound for about 7 pounds of books to give away because pulp fiction paperbacks are pretty lightweight.

Full disclosure, I'm in Ohio and many kids here are part of Dolly Parton's imagination library, which is *wonderful*. But once the kids are old enough to want early chapter books instead of picture books, people don't donate those as much. And before anyone jumps in about ebooks, a lot of these students have to turn in their cellphones at the beginning of the school day. So that makes them need actual books even more.

"Intertextual Echoes: Marcela's Journey from Don Quixote to Br√°s Cubas I've been delving into the literary and historical references in Machado de Assis's The Posthumous Memoirs of Br√°s Cubas and stumbled upon a curious phenomenon: intertextual characters. These are characters who appear across different authors' works and universes, often because one author draws inspiration from another.

Take Marcela, for instance. The frequent nods to Don Quixote in Machado's work suggest a connection between his Marcela and Cervantes‚Äô version. While Machado's Marcela is born of vice and Cervantes' of virtue, the words of the chaste shepherdess in Don Quixote could perfectly well have come from the mouth of the lascivious lady in Br√°s Cubas:

> I can‚Äôt conceive why a woman who‚Äôs loved for her beauty should be obliged to love whoever loves her.

This got me thinking about how authors use intertextual characters to create contrast, add ironic tension, or explore new literary motives.

Are there other intertextual characters in literature you've come across? How do these connections between different works enhance or change your reading experience?",normal
"Did fame and popularity affect any other author as badly as it did to George RR Martin? Huge fan of George and he seems like a great guy. His books are some of my favourites, definitely before I read any of Joe Abercrombie's work. 

However, no matter how you look at it, ever since he struck sword throne heights of mega-stardom while the first series of Game of Thrones aired, his creativity for the main series has been completely stifened. Dance of Dragons (fifth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series) was published a few months after the first episode aired. Exactly 13 years 3 months and weeks ago (thank my Alexa for working that out).

Okay, yes, Fire and Blood (2018) was also fantastic and I'm so glad it exists...

Anyway, so it got me thinking. Did fame and popularity affect another artist's creativity disastrously? 

I've heard of a few examples, like Patrick Rofthuss (Kingkiller Chronicles) and Scott Lynch (Gentleman Bastards). Any more?

Doesn't have to be in regards to writer's block either. Maybe of authors where the fame went completely to their heads?

"Do you intentionally spoil books for yourself, why or why not? When I was in high school, we were reading some book and my teacher spoiled the ending for us. The whole class basically screamed, ""Spoilers!!"" To which my teacher responded with something along the lines of, ""If you're too focused on what happens next, you won't pay attention to what is happening now."" 

I used to spoil things for myself constantly, that way I could focus on what was happening now. I didn't have to wonder what happened next, I already knew. I could appreciate foreshadowing, metaphors, other literary devices. 

My friends and husband began admonishing me for this behavior and that I should appreciate the journey, not the destination. 

I've recently decided to read all of The Vampire Chronicles. I had a feeling when I picked up the series that this would be influential to me as a person and had the chance to become a cherished universe. In many fandoms, I think there's this sense of how lovely it would be to read the books again for the first time. So I decided to not spoil anything for myself, I wanted to do what so many fans wish they had done and truly appreciate that first read. 

And in retrospect, I felt like I flew through Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and Queen of the Damned because I knew something was being built up to. I didn't know what it was, but I knew it, whatever it was, was coming. And came it did. 

I'm only about halfway through the series, I just finished The Vampire Armand and am currently reading the Mayfair Witches before attacking Merrick. As more characters and lore are being introduced into this universe, I want to re-read the original three books. In my search to learn what was happening next, I missed a lot of this is happening now. I sort of regret not spoiling the books for myself, almost like I truly couldn't appreciate that first read like I intended. 

In general, whenever I re-read a book, I feel I take away more from the story since I can focus on the now. Sort of like when you re-watch the Sixth Sense. Which is why I feel like maybe you should spoil the story for yourself and my English teacher was right. But isn't there also something really satisfying about a good  M.

"Notes on an Execution by Danya Kukafka  First of all, incredible book. Definitely a 5/5 for me. That said, my brain can't move to the next book in my TBR with all these thoughts swirling in it, so I figured I'd put them here to get other opinions.

Quick summary: The book follows serial killer Ansel Packer on the day of his execution, along with several women whom he has affected.

Thoughts:

* As expected from any book that features a killer, there is insight into Ansel's Tragic Backstory (TM). I'm glad that the book doesn't seem to glorify or excuse his behavior because of his past.
* Ansel is a pathetic, snivelling, little cockroach of a man who seems to believe that he does not deserve punishment for what he's done.
* About (what I think is) the thesis of the book: >!I can see that the book tries to argue against the death penalty by presenting it as ultimately pointless, but the rage that Ansel inspires throughout the story makes it difficult to feel that he shouldn't have been executed. Based on his thoughts and his failed escape plan, letting him rot in jail would just give him more time to plot more escapes, or at least pontificate some more about how he is actually Not A Bad Person and his stupid little Theory. In real life, I disagree with the death penalty because of how broken the justice system is, but in this fictional world, I think it was justified.!<
* About Lavender: >!Why did Lavender not go back to rescue her kids after finding out that her husband drove in the opposite direction after she called the cops? I am happy that she was able to escape her situation, but part of me hates that she got to live and heal in her little hippie commune while the traumatized kid she abandoned went on to kill four women and traumatize others. She even questions it in the book, when she asked how things would have been different if she had saved her kids instead of just herself. I get that she was doing what she thought was best at the time (or probably just out of her mind completely), but she literally left a scared 4-year-old with his starving newborn brother alone in a secluded house for hours and never sought them out again until way too late.!<
* About Blue: >! I wonder if being able to stay in touch with Blue and her mom would have been enough to turn Ansel around? Would it at least have saved Jenny? Or would he have just felt the urge to kill again eventually?!<
* For all the author says about wanting to focus on and tell the stories of victims, much of the book was still centered around Ansel - his thoughts, his sob story, his belief that he did not deserve punishment, his mommy issues, his inner turmoil, and how his actions colored everyone's lives.
* The author did make a great point about the strange obsession with (usually white, usually male) serial killers, though. I mean, even I chose to borrow this book specifically because of the subject matter.
* All of Ansel's chapters were in 2nd person, which surprisingly did not bother me at all.",normal

"I really didn't like Huckleberry Finn's ending. Which book did you enjoy...except for the ending? Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a great read. It's full of adventure but also gets you to think about a lot of important things, like societal rules and hypocrisy, poverty, racism, slavery, freedom, friendship, etc.

I was enjoying reading the book except the ending really surprised me but in a bad way. That's when Tom Sawyer shows up and suddenly turns a serious situation (can't say more without giving away important plot points) into a child's play, a game, and totally changes the tone of the book.

I have no idea what happened. It's almost as if Mark Twain was trying to write two different novels and liked the first one but accidentally attached the ending of a second one to it.

I'm not sure if the change was as disturbing to other readers as it was for me, but not a lot of people talk about it. I guess it pales in comparison to controversy about the use of N word.

"What are your favorite depictions of afterlife (hell in particular but also heaven and purgatory) in literature? Halloween is nearly here so I've come across a lot of questions on Reddit about Hell and I thought why not, let me ask another. But I'm generalizing my question to include afterlife, so literary references to heaven and purgatory are welcome too.

Okay, so pretty much everybody who talks about afterlife in literature at some point references Dante's Inferno. Which I have been meaning to read but never have. Or rather I did try, but the particular translation I was reading was so confusing I gave up on it twice, after reading a few pages.

But I've come across quite a few descriptions of afterlife elsewhere and the one that stayed with me the most was Joyce's.

In A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Joyce does not take us to hell directly but indirectly through a very long lecture about what hell must be like. It's a lecture the narrator is forced to sit through.

It goes on for pages but here is a sample:

>The horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by its awful stench. All the filth of the world, all the offal and scum of the world, we are told, shall run there as to a vast reeking sewer when the terrible conflagration of the last day has purged the world. The brimstone, too, which burns there in such prodigious quantity fills all hell with its intolerable stench; and the bodies of the damned themselves exhale such a pestilential odour that, as saint Bonaventure says, one of them alone would suffice to infect the whole world. The very air of this world, that pure element, becomes foul and unbreathable when it has been long enclosed. 

>Consider then what must be the foulness of the air of hell. Imagine some foul and putrid corpse that has lain rotting and decomposing in the grave, a jellylike mass of liquid corruption. Imagine such a corpse a prey to flames, devoured by the fire of burning brimstone and giving off dense choking fumes of nauseous loathsome decomposition. And then imagine this sickening stench, multiplied a millionfold and a millionfold again from the millions upon millions of fetid carcasses massed together in the reeking darkness, a huge and rotting human fungus. Imagine all this, and you will have some idea of the horror of the stench of hell.",normal
"If you‚Äôre a paleo nerd/fan of Jurassic Park, ‚ÄúExtinction‚Äù by Douglas Preston is a VERY relevant read right now  As a paleo nerd I started reading this book because I was at barnes and noble last month and saw a table with a bunch of copies. The synopsis instantly grabbed my attention and to my knowledge there hasn‚Äôt been any published book with a plot centering de-extinction of prehistoric animals outside of dinosaurs. Yes, it is very similar to the premise of Jurassic Park, but it is unique in its own way.

Basically it takes place in a resort in Colorado that houses cloned Wooly Mammoths, glyptodons, big sloths and Megaloceros and other animals I forgot the names of. A murder happens on the resort and entire plot is solving said murder. 

I‚Äôm just going to say I recommend this book not just because it has scenes including some badass Pleistocene fauna but because it has very important themes on genetic power. 

I found it a very relevant book to be published in 2024 considering Wooly Mammoths actually ARE in the process of [being cloned](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/03/06/1235944741/resurrecting-woolly-mammoth-extinction). The book explores the future what ifs‚Ä¶ like, ‚Äúwhat will happen after we clone the mammoth?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs this ethical?‚Äù It will have you questioning why scientists are even cloning mammoths, and if we should lead that way. After reading Jurassic park, at least you can think, ‚Äúwell, this would never happen since dinosaur DNA is long gone by the time we find their bones.‚Äù But with this book I honestly found pondering on a reality that IS happening. 

So I recommend this if you want to read sci-fi thriller with strong topics like genetic engineering or just care about prehistoric animals lol.",normal
"I read Dracula and Frankenstein back to back for Spooky Season. Here are my thoughts.  The first of the books I read was Dracula. It was a really fun adventure with some creepy atmosphere. I really enjoyed the epistolary format. I liked the characters and wanted to see them overcome Dracula. It did drag a bit in the middle, but I expect that to some degree, even with modern books. And the repetition could be annoying, but I have heard that it was originally published a chapter at a time in an old literary magazine so some repetition is to be expected. I would absolutely recommend it to someone who has patience with books, especially if they're looking for something different than modern books tend to offer. Overall, I'm glad that I read it first. 

Frankenstein, however, I did not enjoy. I will admit that a large part of that feeling is that Victor Frankenstein is the worst kind of overentitled spoiled brat who refuses to own up to any mistakes. But I just felt like the whole novel was a slog in which I was mentally yelling at him to make literally any other choice.

That being said, I feel like Frankenstein is the more important novel to read. It may be the most important novel I can even remember reading. The message of taking care of the people we bring into the world is especially poignant in an age of iPad kids and robots that are (supposedly) self aware enough to end their own existence in the face of endless labor. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the conversation the novel poses or the history of science fiction in general.

As an aside, it's a shame that these two novels are so overshadowed by the 1930s movies that barely resemble the novels in anything but name.",normal

"I liked Ayn Rand's ""Anthem"" I rewrote my old review

Yes, to hear ""Ayn Rand"" and ""Like"" in the same sentence on this subreddit is beyond fiction, but what can I do, I liked this story. Probably because it looks like a fanfiction about Zamyatin's ""We"" (Which, unfortunately, is not as popular as ""1984"" and ""Brave New World"").

Let's start with the world of this story.

This is a dystopia where people have numbers and nicknames instead of names, pronouns are removed from the lexicon: I, He, She, You, etc. People live according to a certain schedule (wake up, have breakfast, work, have lunch, work, go to the theater, have dinner, sleep, repeat), but progress here has gone back 100 years and the most advanced invention is a candle.

The world of this story is frightening. And this is due to the way the book is written, namely in the form of the diary of the main character, which makes you feel the atmosphere of a creepy place where robots in human guises seem to live.

Now about the plot.

The main character works as a cleaner and one day finds a strange door leading to a tunnel, and there he finds strange flasks on the ceiling. And that's where the story begins.

I liked the first half. The way the hero tried to create something in secret from the government, his thoughts and experiences on this matter are quite interesting and intense. Although there were some silly moments (How he quietly built a stove in the tunnel is still a mystery).

But the second half is dissapoint. >!After the hero escaped into the forest, the author seemed to be trying to finish the story as quickly as possible and therefore there are no obstacles for the hero, and he also finds an old house that has been standing for as much as 100 years and at the same time it looks like someone just hasn't cleaned there for a month. Yes, it is clear that the author showed the freedom of the hero in this way, but still this part is somehow poorly done.!<

Now about the main character.

Of the main characters ever created by this author, this one is the most adequate, but still not like all the others. Although he tried to be like everyone else, he was too tall and smart (and lucky) for this world. But it still makes you sad for him in the middle of the story.

I can't say anything about the philosophy of this author, only that the author has told much better about her here, and only because it is a short book.

The author's writing style is normal here. The book is written in the form of a diary, as I said above, because of this, the emotions of the hero are much stronger. The author's syllable is hard to read. And Ayn Rand, as much as she was hated, wrote atmospherically.

As a result, I liked the story. Let the second half of the story be bad, and the hero is not very interesting, but I liked the gloomy world, the first half, where the hero tried to invent something, and the atmosphere of a gray world and freedom from it.

It's not the good dystopia, but I can't call it a bad one either.",normal

"Publishing order vs Timeline Order Recently I was looking into starting the Malazan series which has two authors and a publishing order as well as a chronological order. Which got me thinking about how I've approached he'd other series in the past.

Typically I've always done publishing order because  if I had started the series when it first came out than that would've been the way I consumed the material and that's the way the author wanted  the story to be told but I can see the argument for doing it chronologically.

Personally I think I'll stick to publishing order but interested to hear other people's thoughts.

Edit: thanks for those who have validated my feelings about publishing order,ti do agree that some completed series may benefit from chronological but in the end I agree that if the author intended it to be that way they would've written it that way.

Also thanks for those who specifically spoke on the Malazan series I will be going by the publishing order.",normal
"Books I Would Like to Talk About  So I read a lot of books at the same time, even though I am in college and need to focus on assigned readings. But my brain just wants to read whatever book I am in the mood for so I have this big stack next to my bed. I also find it impossible to binge read a book unless its short or its one I really like. With that said, I don't really have anybody to talk to about these books, so I came up with an idea. I am going to put down a list of all the books I am currently reading and my opinions on them, and if any of them catch your eye please feel free to comment your opinions about them. Whether you love or hate them, or want to give an analysis of the work I am all ears and want to engage with that. So the list is as follows (with title, genre, and author name):

Fences (Dramatic theater)- Wilson: Halfway through it and like it. I am interested on finding out what the ultimate theme of the work is an how it will end. If I had to guess it will have something to do with resentment.  

Hatchet (YA Survival)- Paulsen: Just started it, brothers read it when they were in middle school. Seems pretty easy and simple. Definitely was written for younger audience. 

There, There (Drama)- Orange: I have trouble getting into this work. It has nothing to do with the subject matter which I find interesting, but the prose don't appeal to me and fail to grip my attention. 

A Wizard of Earthsea (Fantasy/Bildungsroman)- Le Guin: It started out strong but I also don't like the prose of this work. It feels more like it is telling me whats happening when I would much rather experience it through more specific and detailed scenes. 

A Walk in the Woods (Humor)- Bryson: I have really enjoyed this book so far. I like hiking and I am also a novice much like the main characters of this book who try trekking through the Appalachian trail without much experience. It is funny, informative and I hope to finish it soon. 

Sing, Unburied, Sing (Drama)- Ward: Just started it. I can't say much except that I so far think it is very well written and I have empathized with the characters fairly quickly. 

Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini (Historical)- Pauley: Brother gave me this after I asked him about the differences between Communism and Fascism. It is a rather digestible read that I would recommend to anybody who wants to understand Totalitarian regimes, their rises to power, and the differences in ideology between them. 

Giovanni's Room (Drama)- Baldwin: This is so well written. Jame Baldwin is such a fantastic writer, and even though I am not a gay man, I understand the complexities of love that are discussed in this novel. It is fantastic. 

Neverwhere (Fantasy)- Gaiman: I know Gaiman is a controversial figure right now but I started to read this before the whole controversy started and I want to know how this ends. This book is exciting, has created an interesting world, and has taught me more about the city of London than I had previously thought before picking it up. 

Complete Poems (Poetry)- Milton: Reading this for a class right now. Appealed to me because it seemed similar enough to my two favorite authors Tolkien and Shakespeare. I can see why Milton is considered one of the greatest poets of the English language. 

Othello (Dramatic theater)- Shakespeare: Only halfway through the play. Not as good as the other ones I have read. I think I just prefer more grandiose tragedies Shakespeare has made. Iago and Othello are good characters they just don't seem to grip me the same way as Hamlet or any other the characters in Lear would. Considering if I should just restart reading it from the beginning in case I missed something. 

Coriolanus (Dramatic Theater)- Shakespeare: It seems interesting to me but its just so long! Its the 2nd longest Shakespeare play and its characters lack the same complexities and entertaining qualities as those in Hamlet. Whenever I pick it up the dialogue grows tiresome after a while and I put it down.   

Red Rising (Sci Fi)- Brown: This one is weird because it is well written and not at the same time. There are multiple moments where I have started reading this that made my eyes roll because of the main characters personality. But with that said, I always find myself being taken into this world and losing track of time when I pick it up. It is quite a gripping and exciting book that, when it gets your attention, it is able to hold it for a while. 

The Hobbit (Fantasy)- Tolkein: I have probably reread this book more than any other. I love it

Chronicles of Narnia (Fantasy)- Lewis: Reading it for the first time. Put it down for a bit because I want to save it for a cold day. 

Confessions (Autobiography)- Rousseau: Well written, but have not read it in a while because the awkward experiences give me flashbacks to my own. 

Jane Eyre (Classics/Bildungsroman)- Bronte: First time I have read an author and thought ""I hope to write like that one day"". It is so good I love it. Rochester is hilarious, dramatic, and lovable, despite the characters possibly problematic nature.  

Great Expectations (Classics/Bildungsroman)- Dickens: I actually like this despite everybody I've met in real life seeming to hate it. I have had to put it down for a while though because, as a single guy who is a bit of a hopeless romantic, some moments are too painful to read. 

Tess of the D'urbervilles (Classics)- Hardy: Horribly depressing 

Two Memoirs of the Renaissance (Historical Diaries)- Brucker: Two diaries of rich merchants from the Renaissance. Had to read it for a class. Debating if I still want to, maybe when I am in the mood for some primary sources on Renaissance life. 

The Basic Political Writings (Philosophy)- Rousseau: Interesting, only real piece of philosophy I am reading at the moment. 

Francis of Assisi (Historical)- Vauchez: A book recounting the life of St. Francis of Assisi. Give an interesting perspective of Italian life, and on the Papacy during the 1200s. ",normal

"""Her Lover"" by Maxim Gorky I read this short story a few months ago and I keep thinking about it. It's such a short but very effective story. Around that time I was reading a lot of Russian short stories from  Gogol and Tolstoy and a common thing I noticed among them is how populist/street-wise they are. They are stories you would expect to hear from an old sailor or construction worker at the bar. They are simple and dead-honest. It's basically the exact opposite of the hyperintellectual Frenchies like Sartre and Camus (which I love but I'm just pointing out the contrast). I recommend you read it, it's very short.",normal

"What books do you think could have benefited from multiple points of view? I just finished reading The Secret History by Donna Tartt. It was a good book which I relatively enjoyed but by the end of the book, I felt something was lacking. I then realized that the book would have been so much better if it had had at least one pov of Henry. I don't want to give too much away about The Secret History but Henry's mysterious character was a source of intrigue throughout most of the book and in a way, that intrigue worked to make me interested, but by the time I finished the book, I felt that if I had read at least one chapter with his pov, it would have been much more interesting and entertaining. 

Having multiple povs can be a hit or miss, but sometimes, I brings some much needed depth into a book. This is especially true if the book is not focused mainly on a character's internal struggles but an external one. In the Secret History, the narrator's struggles were more external than internal and to some extent, I believe he was not the most interesting character in the book. He felt like a side character sometimes. That's why by the time the book ended, I felt like ""Dang, I would have really loved to enter the minds of the other characters""

Are there any books like this that come to mind even apart from TSH? ",normal
"Which authors, living or dead, you would love to have lunch with, or spend an hour talking with them? Sorry for the awkward question. What I mean by having lunch with is just being in their presence. Someone who is a huge fan of the spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle told me exactly that. Just being in the guy's presence, he said, would bring him so much joy and peace.

For me though, I like to spend the time talking to the authors I like. Because a book, I feel, is a kind of conversation, even if it appears one-sided at first. Books exist to be read by people. The author sits in a room for many hours writing for an imaginary or ideal reader. The author has things to say about life, beauty, power, violence, despair, friendship, love, freedom, pain, fear, loneliness, etc. He or she wants to create certain feelings and stimulate some thoughts in the reader and be heard and understood.

At least that's how I look at it.

So if I had an hour with Kurt Vonnegut, I want to ask him: What do you think of human beings and the future of humanity? How have your views changed over time? Do you think we are doomed or do you see glimmers of hope? Tell me about Slaughterhouse-Five. How did it come to you and how did you write it? What's your favorite passage? How do you feel about the book after all these years? Would you change any of it?

"Hannibal (book 3) ending  Major spoilers for Hannibal by Thomas Harris


I know people have discussed the ending to this book before but I need to have my own discussion because‚Ä¶.. I just couldn‚Äôt believe it.

If the book ended just with Starling running away with Dr. Lecter consensually, I‚Äôd only be like ‚Äúwow that is stupid and ruins the whole series‚Äù

But the fact that she was drugged and hypnotized into doing that makes me say ‚Äúwow I‚Äôm absolutely disgusted and horrified AND it‚Äôs stupid and ruins the whole series‚Äù

I know some people like it because it‚Äôs dark and horrifying. However I feel it could have been dark and horrifying without destroying a strong heroine like Agent Starling. The whole book screwed her over and didn‚Äôt let her redeem herself.

"The Egyptian by Mika Waltari 1945 Has anyone else read this lately?  What did you like about it?  I love this book and it is one of my all time favorites.  I enjoyed the sights, sounds and smells of the ancient Egyptian empire as Sinuhe tells the tale of his adventurous life.  Although set in the distant past, Waltari illistrates that human nature never changes.  I especially liked the main character, Sinuhe, who shows all the weakness of any young man of the world trying to make a living in Thebes.  His many setbacks and triumphs kept me along for the adventure.  ",normal
"To Paradise-Hanya Yanagihara: Book 1: Washington Square I never post about a book before concluding it, but on this occasion, my knowing of the fact that the three sections of this particular book are largely independent from each other, combined with the profound emotional frustration brought upon me by the ending of the first book, led me here. Once again (for the second time in fact, as I have read both A Little Life and The People In The Trees but despite liking the latter it didn't have all that much emotional impact on me, at least of that kind) I find myself a victim of Yanagihara's masterful, yet heartless literary manipulation. Despite tremendously enjoying her work I sometimes wish that she wasn't so good at it, or that at least the belief that the art of writing to its very core is the manipulation of the reader wasn't so deeply rooted inside of her. Falling for it is certainly humbling especially since I consider myself someone who isn't affected by art media (and I'm not, at least my friends agree with me on that). But when it comes to Yanagihara, it's like she's the Lars Von Trier of literature. Her painfully accurate excessive portrayal of (equally excessive) human suffering is impossible to leave me unmoved, especially since much of it is so familiar to me due to my being a gay man. So going back to Washing Square, this is where the spoilers begin: >!The way she ensures that the reader falls in love with Edward as much as David and presents the proposition of the former of fleeing to west as a seeming paradise just to violent crash it with the revelation of what (supposedly) is Edward's true colors, creates an utter and complete conflation of David and the reader, in both the original sorrow and the following denial. When David first proclaimed to his Grandfather that he didn't believe the report and what it claimed about Edward my literal thought were: ""Dude, you're a fucking moron. I would probably do the same but you're a fucking moron nonetheless''. And despite that, during reading what remained of the section I found myself yearning for the slightest of proof that Edward's refutes of the report **might** be honest, to grab onto it and never let go. But of course that never came and instead came information (or lack of thereof) methodically delivered by Yanagihara to keep things unclear but have the scale leaning in the negative side. As someone whose life seems to be filled with infatuation yet deprived of actual relationships of substance I found both David's denial of the evidence presented to him about Edward, whom he sees as his last hope of escaping what he is (also the confines of the suffocating family milestone building on Washington Square and the dreadful future that awaits him there) and becoming what he has always wanted to be, as wells as the side-story about his past relationship with Andrew. In the end, the narrator concludes that even if David's choice ends up being a foolish one, it is his to make after all, and that a person who is not entitled to making wrong decisions, at whatever cost they may come, is not a free person. !<Having read the back cover of the book I know that the second sections take place 100 years into the future and that we probably are not gonna hear anything about that first section ever again, which makes the whole thing even more frustrating and confusing. So, to those who have read the whole thing, it would be greatly appreciated if you could (without spoiling of course) share what did you think of the other two or how do they compare in terms of emotional impact to the first one, as well as sharing your thoughts and feelings on the first one. I got too caught up in my intense feelings to mention what is considered obvious in my mind: just like I am used to, Yanagihara's prose remains superb in my eyes, the section is no exception that. I also find the reimaging of American History in the section to be impressively detailed and vastly creative but I will be able to say more on that once I have finished the whole things. For now, as it's pretty late, I'm looking forward for tomorrow to come so I can start with the second one, not only due to excitement, because despite all the frustration I still loved the section and found it great, but also because I'm desperately in need of something to distract me from the uncertainty and the comb in my stomach that were dotingly gifted to me by the first section.

P.S: If you made it that far, you're a patient one, you have my respect.",normal
"How can I get my son to enjoy reading? My son is 8 and just does not enjoy reading. He avoids it all costs. He's in a reading assistance program at school but he's still behind. They let him pick reading games on a computer, and he says he always picks the game that reads to him so he doesn't have to read. I've read to him for 30 minutes a day since basically birth. For the most part he likes books, he just won't read them himself. He won't even play video games if he has to read to figure out what to do. We go to the library regularly and I let him pick out any book he wants. But he won't read them. He'll only listen if I read them to him. I've modeled reading for him -- I read before bed every night and on the weekends when I can.

To be clear I don't really care if he enjoys reading as a hobby. I just want him to start doing it on his own so he can do well in school. He's great at math but can hardly do the word problems on his own.

"Why do you read? Pre-university I used to read everything I could get my hands on. I just *loved* books.

"The Collected Regrets of Clover by Mikki Brammer Yesterday, I finished The Collected Regrets of Clover and am unsure how to feel about the book. 

First the **pros** :

* I loved the subject matter, it was refreshing to discuss a heavy subject matter easily. I loved the fact that Brammer normalized grief and denounced how society expects us to move on so fast after losing someone. It is validating and reassuring to know that other people struggle with grief long after their loved one is gone.
* I love the fact that Claudia did not get to say goodbye to the love of her life, I felt like it was realistic. I loved how she expressed that we often romanticize the road not taken because it only exists in our mind.
* The book was beautifully written with so much prose and beautiful quotes
* I loved that the focus of the story was on Clover and not her love life. I enjoy romance, but I am a sucker for Women's fiction
* I loved the fact that she was a late bloomer in her late thirties. I don't take I have read a book where the FMC was that old and never had any experience in love. I think it's an important representation as younger people have sex/love experiences later in their lives and it's important to normalize it

Now the **cons**:

* I feel like the pace was odd, sometimes it was fast other times it was slow and it dragged on and on, on unimportant plot points. For example, I thought it was odd how she dragged on and on about how uncomfortable Clover was on the drive to Maine, but skipped the drive back. It would've been interesting to show us how meeting Hugo impacted her on the drive back instead of telling us.
* I didn't like how she portrayed Sebastien. He was a douche, but a soft douche. Also, I felt like Clover was hard on someone who was about to lose a loved one. For example, that time when he was 23 mins late, she should've spoken up if it bothered her. I don't know if I was empathizing with Sebastien because I was also a horrible friend when I was about to lose my grandmother. I felt like the author missed the mark on this one, I felt like the reader was supposed to resent Sebastien instead of realizing that dating while losing someone you love is not always a good idea. I would've loved a discussion on how grieving is lonely and that we cling to anyone or anything just to feel less lonely.
* Hugo was too insta-love. Unfortunately, Ms. Perfect doesn't exist and I thought that his character was odd in the book. The book is sad, heart-breaking and full of regrets and there, she finds the perfect man who matches all her criteria and remembers everything about her. Clover needed to find someone who wasn't exactly perfect but with whom she would've felt good. I felt like Hugo was just her grandfather in a younger form. 

This was longer than I expected but I needed to get it off my chest. Overall it was a great book (3.5 stars), and a beautiful debut, I just had some ick through my reading",normal
"Piranisi -thoughts? I've just finished reading Piranisi and I didn't really enjoy it. I felt it was long and slow, you barely get to know any of the characters. I found the world very uninteresting and there was so much focus on the statues, which never really went anywhere. The twist felt a little similar to Life of Pi, but I felt it was done better there. The whole experience was very flat.

"Steppenwolf - Discussion & Thoughts Steppenwolf might be *the* official anti-pretentious hipster manifesto, exclusively read by pretentious hipsters.  
  
In all seriousness, this is a nice story about freeing yourself from your personal preconceptions about yourself. Our main character, Harry Haller is pretentious and has locked himself into a cycle of looking down on what he deems 'lesser art' and the people who enjoy it. This leads him to perceive himself as the 'steppenwolf', an isolated lonesome wolf figure which lives apart from society. Throughout the book he meets characters that will question his stance and his binary view of the world which leads to quite interesting discussions.  
  
I thought the book was quite well written, despite somewhat of a slow start. It's easy to see yourself in some capacity in Harry Haller's character. When he's in a new setting and is deeply uncomfortable by the actions of people, or when he sneers at others to protect himself. It's ultimately sort of a coming of age story, except we're following a man going through suicidal ideation and depressive thoughts in his 40s. This means we get to read through the classic tropes such as Harry finding love, going out dancing, taking drugs (wait, what?) and emerging from his shell.  
  
The supernatural elements of the novel which live in Harry's mind drive the mysterious elements forward and really provide a unique energy to the story. The entire sequence of the Fancy Dress Ball really struck me and by that point I was in a frenzy as well, reading as fast as Harry was drunkenly dancing with whoever crossed his path. These were by far my favorite scenes, especially those with Hermine as Hermann.  
  
Harry thinks there is a wolf inside of him. He thinks that personality is binary. Either he's the wolf, a reminder of all things natural and ready to bite anything that crosses him, or he's the human would-be bourgeois who strives to live through high-art. He doesn't realise that there is an infinite amount of personalities and beings that live within him, and that his commitment to seeing the world through the lens of duality is deeply hurting him and setting him back. The trial he finds himself in by the end tests and challenges this dilemma he's dug himself into.",normal

"my confusion with unreliable narrators I recently read Babel and i was reading reviews about the book. I saw many comments about how robin is an unreliable narrator, actually his friends group wasn't as close as he thinks and he just wanted to have a family that's why he thought like this. BUT this sounded like an interpretation to me rather than him being necessarily unreliable.

Later i found out rf kuang also stated Robin is unreliable one of her [interview](https://www.goodreads.com/interviews/show/1570.R_F_Kuang)s;  
*RFK: The narrator of the main text is Robin, whose point of view is extremely narrow and limited. He only knows what he knows, and he doesn't know very much, so he's confused most of the time. He's a classically unreliable narrator, and if you take the text through his eyes, then you come off with a very small idea of what's going on throughout the story.¬†""*

ISN'T THIS how pretty much all first-person narrators are?? :'D i think you can say this for almost every first-person narrator because they are human with subjective opinions. this ""unreliable narrator"" just creates an open interpretation for the readers' which is normal like this is how literature works but nowadays i feel like readers are nit-picking and taking it too far. cmon if you interpret deeply enough, any character could be seen as unreliable... 

I think one of the best example of an unreliable narrator was The Sense of an Ending by Julian Barnes. the whole point of the book is how our memories aren‚Äôt always accurate; people tend to reshape them without even realizing, making the past seem the way they want to remember. And you discover this with the main character as you read the book, also he realises the way he perceived events are distorted when he finds old letters from his past. Personally I think this is a narrator you can safely call ""unreliable"". 

IDK am i missing something? personally i need some concrete evidence to call a character unreliable; otherwise, it feels like just a speculation hahaha

"Tempted to reread ""The Last Election"" by Andrew Yang and Stephen Marche I read the book in September 2023. I found it relatively interesting and compelling though realize many aspects of it were very traumatized. Given the promise of the book, the plot was relatively straightforward and the characters were a bit underdeveloped but of course so with this could be outrageous at times. None of us I've enjoyed it. However I am reading it again as we get close to the election. I'm very sure I will finish it anytime. I'm just wondering if it's hitting too close to home. Because since last year the political climate has swung in many different directions not to mention many news stories that may not apply to the book anymore.

I am not asking Reddit permission to read the book again. I'm just finding it amusing that the alternative of the books primaries draws as many parallels with the real world political climate and current election.

I‚Äôm usually used to horror books (especially by R.L. Stine and Stephen King), and wasn‚Äôt too big of a fan to dystopian genre, so I thought this may do the trick; it didn‚Äôt, at all.

Now let me be clear, I do acknowledge that the book have been very influential, and it does provide some perspective in politics, but only some.

I read books mainly from the point of view of storytelling, and to be quite frank, I‚Äôm not a fan of 1984. So what are my problems with this book?

1. Needless repetitions: essentially in part 2, all the book does is repeat the same shit in Goldstein‚Äôs book over and over and over and over again. We get it, we don‚Äôt need 30-40 pages worth of monologue that could easily be shaved down.

2. Lack of subtleties: what I like about any stories is subtlety. Unfortunately, 1984 did not have any of that at all. All it does it beat you in the head with a baseball bat telling you that totalitarianism is bad over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. I don‚Äôt need to be told several times in several ways how Stalinist/N@zi totalitarianism is bad. I get it. I‚Äôve read the Cold War before, you don‚Äôt need to repeat to keep saying it louder and hold my hand throughout the book. The concepts in the book are also too simplistic to be meaningful or deep.

3. Amorphous application: people on both sides of American politics like to say that 1984 is prophetic, but I would argue it is no more prophetic than simply saying ‚Äúall politicians are liar.‚Äù No shit Sherlock. It‚Äôs not prophetic, and it‚Äôs arguably more amorphous to any political enemies, whether it be Trump or Kamala or whoever a person doesn‚Äôt like.

Nitpick 1: basically, this isn‚Äôt really a real criticism, but more so my personal nitpick on the story, but Winston is a major creep and I‚Äôd hate to know what fetishes does Julia have to even ‚Äúshare the bed‚Äù with that creep. Bro just admits wanting to r-pe and slit her throat‚Ä¶and she had sex with him anyway??? Nobody will realistically do that if a guy/gal admits something like that in front of their face. Yes I‚Äôm aware the society in 1984 is very war-hungry and totalitarian, I get it. But can‚Äôt we at least have one decent character that doesn‚Äôt at least have a major problem???

Nitpick 2: another nitpick of mine is the seemingly invincibility of The Party, which I find unrealistic. Even totalitarian parties like national socialists and Soviet Russia eventually collapsed. Why can‚Äôt the Party collapse as well? The appendix didn‚Äôt really give me that much hope either.

Overall, not a big fan of 1984 at all. I don‚Äôt consider it a classic. Influential? Sure, but no more influential than memes.",normal
"When have you ever come to a totally wrong (or atleast uncommon) interpretation of a story? I recently started Songs of A Dead Dreamer, a collection of stories by Thomas Ligotti. I read another collection of his stuff (Teatro Grottesco) last year and dug it even if it came off as a bit too high brow at times.

The second story in SoaDD, Les Fleurs, made no sense to me at first. After reading it a second time, I finally understood, or so I thought:

This guy is an alien.

That weird sculpture thing he had in his apartment? An alien device.

That mysterious club that he's a part of? Also aliens in human disguses.

That crazy shit with the sky he showed gf during their vacation? Alien stuff. His spaceship, maybe.

I looked for more discussion online...and not a single thing about aliens. There's stuff about cults, him being an unreliable narrator (which in hindsight I guess is obvious) and typical talk of Lovecraft influnces, but nothing about this dude being a space man.

Has that ever happend to you? Ever find yourself coming to a totally weird conclusion like that?",normal

"Frisk by Dennis Cooper (Book Review) I don't think I'm in a proper state to review this book, but then again, if I don't review it now; perhaps I won't ever in the future.

This was disturbing. Please, I'm putting stress on the word ""disturbing"". Petrifying and nightmarish. To compare; I've read "" The Sluts"" by the same author and it was just uhh, nerve wracking  and painfully dusturbing dump(?), I mean, it was structured in the layout of a website so much of the nuance and critical dwellings were shut off, I feel like, in my opinion. But this? Holy hell. In Frisk, we are following a first person narrative. This sole structuring already opens up alot of gates for intricate and critical depths of dwellings and progressing. I really liked it but oh my, everytime I read a Cooper, it takes me weeks to recover. True halloween and spooky season read if you may.

So anyways; Frisk is a story about intense and extreme sexual desires and fantasies. Here, we follow our narrator from his early years as a teen to his mid 30s. A pornographic incident from when he was 13 strirred up his sexual sadistic desires and made him addictively erotic to such exposures. The brink of reality and illusion starts to fade as with each passing moments the extreme sadistic desires within our narrator keeps prominently getting stronger and stronger to a point where he daydreams all the time of killing others in utterly brutal ways and takes sexual self pleasure within such thoughts. I can't make you understand the intensity of his sexual urges and thoughts; I can't. You have to read to understand it properly; all I can say is; the book felt so real and eerie with such portrayals of fantasies and erotic desires within our narrator that it will always keep you on the toes and you thinking that ""fuck, now he is actually going to do some of those vile things"" ; but no.

**Some spoilers here** 

He doesn‚Äôt, the chapter before the last chapter. The chapters which actually fucked me over and made me shiver, no joke, also while simultaneously making me genuinely gag to the point I felt like I was about to puke (multiple times). This chapter was devastating and bloody fucking messed up. So unsettling and petrifying, I'm inable to comprehend the intensity. Our narrator wrote a lengthy letter to his past lover describing everything in detail about what had happened since the last 2 years. Well, there were descriptions of his extreme sadistic sexual urges coming to life and he killing others, but in such a brutal and detailed mannered that felt so real. But plot twist, it wasn‚Äôt! All this was fakery.

This goes to show in what level his sexual urges dug within himself that he can craft such intense and utterly repulsive descriptions of his fantasies. To think of this is itself disturbing; the entirety of the novel displays sexual paraphilic disorder in such a distinct and striking lens that feels extremely sinking. I'm actually in awe with how masterfully the author crafted this utter vile atmosphere that radiates extreme eerieness and quite frankly, severely menacing and disturbing tone. The nonchalance of our narrator in describing every unusual and horrific details just added more complexity and horror to the story. 

We can observe how the psychological descend and the growing intensity of his sexual sadistic desires hindered his life and his everyday living over the years and almost threw him in the brink of insanity. He didn‚Äôt kill anyone; yet. And the fact that he didn‚Äôt, shows even a bit of rationality and control he has over himself and his devouring urges that eats at him, which felt extremely real to the point of uncanniness. The dire and morbid consequences of obsession and such desires were greatly portrayed in the novel. 

Realistic, nuanced and shivering. Frisk is a story that blends the reality and fictional portrayals of inhumane desires quite effortlessly which leaves us, the readers, in a void of monstrous fearful cycle. Even concluding this review, I feel like I haven‚Äôt said anything or have stated excessively. I seem to never be able to review Dennis Cooper's novels smoothly and/or properly. Genuinely liked the story for what it was but I'm glad I finished it and I'm free.",normal
"What books do you think young people should read and why? There are many lists of classic or recommended literature.  I'm more interested in what exactly a given book offers that you think is valuable or that has meaning to you.  Feel free to suggest books that never show up on such list or ones that do, just as long as it is something that has an impact on you, and tell us what you think a young reader would learn from it.

Here are mine:
Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.  Even though it's short, I think I would recommend it at the college level to avoid shallow take-aways.  I think it's valuable because it shows the importance of empathy.  I would want to have a discussion about the mood organ, whether that's valuable, and if there's anything like it in real life.

Speaker for the Dead
I think this is valuable because it demonstrates that our assumed reasons for other people's behavior often does not match the real reasons.  People are complex, and in order to know why they do the things they do, we have to be willing to see things from their point of view.

Our protagonist has me confused though. While she's clearly not in a great place mentally, I felt like I was supposed to root for her but I really didn't like her at all. 

Obviously The Man was just vile. Predatory. Creepy. All the y's. But so was she?

"Bland Characters and Finale in 'Salem's Lot First off, despite the overall negative tone of this post, I just want to say that I did overall enjoy 'salem's Lot by Stephen King. It's also possible that I came in with expectations that were unattainable. I mean, Stephen King and vampires? That has to be amazing. Right? Almost every review I saw said so, at least.

What I liked: The attention put into the townspeople. I loved the theme of the ""little"" everyday evils perpetrated by normal people. The detached sheriff. The drunk priest. And of course, Ms. McDougall and her penchant for infant abuse. Cringe inducing, it was great. I also liked the theory about the haunted house being some sort of idol that attracted evil to it and possibly even seeped evil into the surrounding community like a radioactive spill. 

Disappointments: So in a book with the background characters being a little more fleshed out, you'd think that the main protagonists would be super compelling. In my opinion, they weren't. Ben doesn't really have any noticeable personality traits besides being a writer and being able to act manly when trying to impress his girlfriend's father. He has his backstory of his experience at the Marsten house (which I did like and appreciate as his reason for coming back) and his experience becoming a widow. Now, I'm not great at recognizing themes or metaphors, so maybe I'm missing something, but I don't understand why the dead wife detail is here. Obviously watching your SO die would be very traumatic, and it is brought up multiple times in the book, but it doesn't seem to impact anything? Ben seems more concerned with his childhood nightmares that with his dead wife. The girlfriend was equally uninspiring and is just sort of there. 

The main band that forms to oppose the vampires supposedly has a deep bond, but as the reader, I find it hard to buy in. The girlfriend (I literally finished the book today and I can't remember the name. I remember Eva Miller, Ben's fat landlord, but not her) tells Ben she loves him on like their 2nd or 3rd date, Ben and Matt get tight very quickly, Ben and Mark form a tight mentor-mentee bond - but the leg work just isn't there and it's very obvious that these characters are being forced together by the author. And I'm not even sure what the solution is. Yes, King could've written more character-building scenes to flesh out the characters and their relationships, but the book is already pretty long. I personally would be fine with another 100-200 pages if it made the characters better, but I saw some people complaining about the book length as it is. I read Lonesome Dove last year and I feel like it's ruined a lot of books for me since. I want real characters, complex relationships. It's hard to find books that can scratch that itch exactly right. 

It's basically a meme at this point that SK isn't very good at endings and I think that happened here too. I think burning the town at the end was a good callback to the town's history, but the finale was very underwhelming. Firstly, Barlow's hiding place is supposed to be a mystery. And I think most people like to try to solve that mystery along with the protagonist. But, correct me if I'm wrong, Barlow's hiding place has zero foreshadowing. The big clue is that he has blue chalk on his fingers. We're led around on a few theories before one character remembers that Eva Miller has a pool table in her cellar from a conversation that is had outside the book's scope. There's no way for the reader to play along and it just comes out of nowhere. I didn't care too much about this but it just seemed odd. Then when they find his resting place, Barlow's big defense is a Home Alone-style trap. It kills one member, granted, but I'm not sure how he thought this would work on all four members of the vampire hunters. It's a trap that, once sprung, will get no one else. You could argue that he also sent an assassin, but that was a middle-aged woman wearing a night dress. Not exactly subtle or effective. Barlow is built up to be this mastermind who is nearly unbeatable, but he goes over like a wet fart. I'm perplexed at how he survived for centuries and Matt's assertion that he is some sort of chess grandmaster genius is laughable.

I apologize for the long rant. I had very high expectations for the book and that inevitably led to some disappointment. Like I said, I did overall enjoy the book. I think I just am learning that my preferences are changing and becoming more stringent. It's really a shame because I wanted to love the book. I'm curious to hear if I missed something or if anyone agrees. Did anyone fall in love with these characters? Do the sequel(s) help contextualize things better?",normal

"Do you purchase kindle books even if they are more expensive than paperbacks? I got myself Kindle a few months ago and I love it. Most of the books I've purchased so far were *""I am not sure if I'm going to like it so I'm not buying a physical copy yet""* or *""yay - sale!""*, but recently, I've wanted to reduce the amount of books I have at home and purchase more ebooks.

However, it often happens that physical books are cheaper than the ebooks, so in those circumstances, I feel like I cannot justify buying them. For example, there's a series I want to purchase right now, and paperbacks are ¬£20.50 for six books. If I purchase the series as ebooks, it comes to ¬£31.50, roughly 50% more! 

So I guess my question is whether you compare prices before deciding on which format you buy? Or do you have a preferred format and buy it regardless the price?

"Visiting Main Street with Sinclair Lewis I had always only had a vague awareness of Lewis as the author of It Can't Happen Here. It was only when I learned about his winning the Nobel Prize that I looked at his work and decided that Main Street sounded the most attuned to my interests.

Carol Milford is a left-wing feminist from the city, whose directionless life takes a new turn when she marries Doctor Will Kennicott. He takes her to live in Gopher Prairie, a town that represents not just Sauk Centre where Lewis grew up, but all the small towns in America, perhaps the world. She runs up against the low cultural expectations, the resolutely right-wing politics, and intense culture of gossip and scrutiny, in various episodes of about eight years of life. Unlike the cliche tales of backwoods life, this book will not end with the girl admitting the silliness of her big-city education and becoming happy with the moral perfection of what she finds.

Early on, it becomes painful the degree to which the country's basic cultural and political conflicts haven't changed. Much has been made of the fact that the two parties were much less ideologically sorted back then, but it still holds true that to a great degree, the Republicans were the party of those with property, both the billionaires and the small-town car salesmen. Lewis' view of the stifling boredom of the small town reads as almost identical to the critiques of suburbia that would written decades later, the articles trying to understand MAGA towns being written today.

Lewis scorns the close-mindedness and narrow visions that the small towns impose; that's for certain. But I was surprised to see that he was not as cynical as I had expected him to be. Carol, too, is a woman full of foibles and elitism of her own, and the book's most decent character turns out to be the unassuming, boring Kennicott. He is acerbic about the flaws in Gopher Prairie, yet he still takes time to acknowledge that there is happiness and comfort and the possibility for improvement in the lives these people choose to live.

> They were staggered to learn that a real tangible person, living in Minnesota, and married to their own flesh-and-blood relation, could apparently believe that divorce may not always be immoral; that illegitimate children do not bear any special and guaranteed form of curse; that there are ethical authorities outside of the Hebrew Bible; that men have drunk wine yet not died in the gutter; that the capitalistic system of distribution and the Baptist wedding-ceremony were not known in the Garden of Eden; that mushrooms are as edible as corn-beef hash; that the word ‚Äúdude‚Äù is no longer frequently used; that there are Ministers of the Gospel who accept evolution; that some persons of apparent intelligence and business ability do not always vote the Republican ticket straight; that it is not a universal custom to wear scratchy flannels next the skin in winter; that a violin is not inherently more immoral than a chapel organ; that some poets do not have long hair; and that Jews are not always peddlers or pantsmakers.

Analyzing the political character of rural America is definitely a great part of the novel. The townsfolk are aware of the fact that they are engaged in class struggle against the farmers who they serve as merchants for. These were, indeed, the sorts of folk that were slaughtering their black neighbors in droves in this period. Yet there's some things I curiously didn't find out - people did not seem overly angry or anxious that the hated Democrats controlled the federal government. With Prohibition, it was actually hard to tell whether people overall supported it or not.

This is self-consciously a very feminist novel. Carol is passionately drawn, human, driven, always aware in little ways of the ways in which being a housewife shapes her place in town. It feels strikingly modern, speaking as someone who never read Hardy or Ibsen. The book even touches on the still-omnipresent matter of the gendering of hobbies. The women have their liberal arts and social talk, the men have their shiny toys, their cars and guns and practical things.

> In all his games, cars and guns and land, he expected Carol to take an interest. But he did not give her the facts which might have created interest. He talked only of the obvious and tedious aspects; never of his aspirations in finance, nor of the mechanical principles of motors. This month of romance she was eager to understand his hobbies. She shivered in the garage while he spent half an hour in deciding whether to put alcohol or patent non-freezing liquid into the radiator, or to drain out the water entirely. ‚ÄúOr no, then I wouldn‚Äôt want to take her out if it turned warm‚Äîstill, of course, I could fill the radiator again‚Äîwouldn‚Äôt take so awful long‚Äîjust take a few pails of water‚Äîstill, if it turned cold on me again before I drained it‚ÄîCourse there‚Äôs some people that put in kerosene, but they say it rots the hose-connections and‚ÄîWhere did I put that lug-wrench?‚Äù

The book does sound like what I've heard about Chekhov's writing in its frustration with the boring idiocy of rural life. I'll have to check in on Three Sisters at some point.

In this book I also found an enjoyment of marriage stories that I‚Äôve never properly cultivated. The fights are sad to read, yet the underlying emotional bond manages to survive. I hope Revolutionary Road is as good as people say it is.

All in all, I had a deliciously solid meal after spending a long time without long novels. I found a passionately humane, empathetic voice in Lewis' writing, and it makes me eager to find another one of his books.",normal

"John LeCarre Appreciation Thread A few years ago, I found myself snowed in with no internet connection. Earlier, a friend had gifted me a complete collection of John LeCarre audiobooks. So I spent about a week doing jigsaw puzzles and listening to spy novels. Not a bad way to spend a few days.

I was struck by the skill LeCarre has as a writer. LeCarre, we all know, worked for both MI5 and MI6 for a while in his youth. In his autobiography, he says that the best training as a writer he ever got was from writing reports to his superiors. His superiors, being all highly-educated Oxford men, were ruthless in grading the language of his reports. They would red-pencil his reports mercilessly, telling him to avoid extraneous words and details and to state his summaries clearly, concisely, and in as few words as possible.

LeCarre, I think is especially gifted when writing his descriptions and grew more skilled from his job in the spy business. Being something of a writer myself, I grew more and more impressed with his skill during that snowed-in week, and I eventually got in the habit of stopping the recording and copying down some of my favorite sentences of his just because they were such a pleasure to marvel at. I recently found that old notebook and found those LeCarre quotes. That prompted this post. Here are a few examples:

One of his characters ventures out in a small boat near an aircraft carrier. LeCarre writes that the carrier

>lay gray and menacing like an unsheathed knife above the water.

Describing a young clerk

>He was a tall, mathematical-looking boy with spectacles and an unblinking gaze.

Describing a luxury box at a racetrack populated by millionaires and gangsters

>A group of wives sat apart like expensive, unused, equipment.

Describing the spinster daughter of an elderly clergyman

>Since girlhood, nothing seemed to have happened to her face beyond a steady diminishing of its hopes.

One of his spies describes her smarmy boss, saying,

>Don doesn't do confrontation. His life is a sideways advance between things he can't face.

I have a few more, but that's a good sample. I don't know about you guys, but I'm impressed at how well LeCarre can capture the essence of something in very few words. He describes one man as having a ""puffy, agricultural face."" You can just *see* that man in those few words.

The fact that you get an interesting spy story is a bonus when you have a talented writer. LeCarre is the kind of writer who could make a trip to the grocery store interesting to read, so a spy thriller is icing on the cake.

One criticism of LeCarre I have is that, when taken in bulk over a snowed-in week doing jigsaw puzzles, his stories too often have a melancholy end. There's rarely a true victory. Our heroes may get the bad guy in the end, but it costs them dearly. And, many times, the bad guy gets away. One never comes away from his books feeling energized and full of hope.

"What character(s) you got invested in that you thought you wouldn't care too much about? I have read many novels and I have liked many female characters, like Navani and Vin from the Cosmere and Yerin from Cradle, but I never got *invested* in them as much as male characters. 

Then I read *Vorkosigan Saga* and fell in love with the character of Cordelia. It's been a long time since I read the books, but I remember a scene where [spoiler] >!Miles is talking to an ambassador about his mother, saying that she thinks of being a Vor matron/Vor lord's wife as a children's game of dressing up.!< I was so amused by the image. 

I also remember some scenes where she is being just a great [spoiler] >!mother to Miles!<. That was quite refreshing. And I would like to quote another line from her, apologies if I misquote, when she is talking to her mother about a certain someone: >!When he is cut, I bleed!<.

I would love to hear what kind of characters you fell in love with unexpectedly!",normal

"Somewhere beyond the sea by TJ Klune **UPDATE: My first DNF ever. 1/79 :(** 

Let me start by saying, I LOVED 'The house in the cerulean sea'. I started the sequel today 'Somewhere beyond the sea', I'm 100 pages in and strongly considering DNF.

It feels so political. Worst, it feels like a straight up sermon, like I'm being preached at. There are some great quotes but they feel misplaced? I don't even know how to explain it, it's like there isn't enough story. Just buzz words, therapy type talk. and quotes. I'm so disappointed.

I am wondering, does it get better? Should I just quit? I was so excited to read this book but now I'm sitting here like ""ugghhhh here we go"" and procrastinating reading more of it.

"Size of books Tl;dr: Does anyone know why publishers change the size of their books half way through a series? And do they usually release books in more sizes later? If so, do you wait for the ‚Äùcorrect‚Äù size or do you just accept that the bookshelf looks uneven?

I recently bought the last two books in TJ Klunes Green Creek series. I always buy paperback and that unfortunately means big size differences sometimes. The first two books in the series are small and the last two are bigger. Same publisher, same cover art, same everything except for the size. This bugs me more than it should. 

Now that I‚Äôm wanting to read the sequel to The House in the Cerulean Sea, Somewhere Beyond the Sea, I asked the book shop first about size and surprise surprise, it‚Äôs also way bigger than the first book. So now Im wondering if I should buy it or if I should maybe borrow it from the library for now and wait to buy it in case it comes out in the smaller size. 

I also bought another one of his books, same publisher, published between books 3 and 4 of the Greek Creek series, and that one was the small size. So it‚Äôs not like all the newer books are big. 

I know this is a nonissue, but it bugs me and I think some people here might understand the struggle haha. This happens so often that I‚Äôm beginning to suspect they do it on purpose because they hate us /jk

"I read Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"", and it was hauntingly beautiful and powerful. As much as I enjoy reading good novels, they practically never get a true visceral reaction out of me. The closest I got to that was A Farewell to Arms. However, after reading one of Cormac McCarthy's other novels, Blood Meridian (which is amongst my favorites) I really wanted to read the Road. I had watched the movie a while before and I remembered liking it, so I decided to buy the book, and I'm glad I did!

This story was so interesting to me I read the entire book (almost 300 pages) in less than 2 days. The best word I can describe this book as, is ""haunting"". It's a tragic story of a father doing his absolute best to take care of his son in a post-apocalyptic world full of starvation, violence, cannibalism. Everyone is on the fight for survival. All are trying to take care of themselves or their families. And the main character, simply known as ""the man"", is no exception. He steals and loots for the sake of his son's safety and welfare.

The two main characters are exceptionally realistic, to the point where it hurts to read. They speak to each other incredibly naturally, like a father would with his young boy to try to make him happy and take care of him. I could easily see my father in the same position as the Man and myself as the Boy, making the same decisions, saying the same things, and thinking the same thoughts. Through their hardships and adventures, they are some of the most deeply personal characters I've seen in a story. It makes sense that this book was inspired by McCarthy's own conversations with his son, since it has such a simple and beautiful genuineness to it, as if these were conversations that were already spoken.

Unlike a lot of McCarthy's other works, it doesn't depict heavy amounts of extreme depravity or sadistic violence, but it mostly consists of the Man and the Boy repeating the cycle of survival. Scavenging for food, searching through abandoned homes and shelters, gathering resources, engaging in conversation with each other, and following the road to the coast. The story is mostly a repeated cycle of this, with some occasional, more intense sequences of suspense sprinkled in carefully. The rare amount of suspense and heavy use of conversations between the Man and the Boy builds up the characters to make them more relatable and understandable, which I think it succeeds exceptionally in doing. By the second half, all I wanted was just for the father and his son to escape, alive and well.

As for the ending (which I will not spoil), I've never cried to a book until I read The Road. The ending was achingly sad, but I wouldn't say it was bleak or hopeless, unlike Blood Meridian's ending. As tragic as it is, there was an element of hope, joy, and positivity. At the last few pages of the novel, the father talks to his son about ""carrying the fire"" to other people. I am not sure exactly what this means, but I interpreted the act of ""carrying the fire"" as spreading humanity's indomitable will to survive to other people, so they may get through the hardest of times (like the trials the father and son go through together). Kind of like the movie ""Grave of the Fireflies"", I thought it was tragic and heart-wrenching, but not with beauty and hope.

I recommend everyone to give this book a try. It's not for everyone by any means; it may be too repetitive for some, or too depressing for others, but it's a powerful experience that you should experience at least once. I would love to hear everyone's thoughts on this novel!",normal
"Which books have had a negative impact on your life?  Some books can help us navigate difficult times if we read them at the right moment, but there are also books that can affect us negatively if read at the wrong time.

Right now, I‚Äôm trying to read Lolita, but I think I‚Äôll set it aside for now (because of the sensitive topic it deals with. I went through some traumatic experience involving sexual assault so It is quite triggering for me). In the past, when I was struggling with depression, I read The Midnight Library, which actually worsened my mental state because of the depressing main character and complete misunderstanding of the depression described in the book, It seemed like the book was saying, life could be worse, or whatever choice you make, you would still be miserable so just don't be depressed.

It might sound a bit extreme, but books have a profound impact on my mental health and life. Atomic Habits changed my life for the better.

"I just finished Dust by Hugh Howey and I am underwhelmed by the ending of this otherwise interesting trilogy. Anyone else feel underwhelmed by the ending of the Silo series? 

Wool was so interesting. Full of suspense and intrigue. Dark and even scary at parts.

Shift was probably my favourite of the three books. Donald‚Äôs story was an amazing addition and learning how the world of Silos came to be was fascinating.

As for Dust, I enjoyed the first half, but felt it lacked an impactful and engaging climax. It just really lost steam. I expected Jules to take more exciting action than simply hosting a town hall. I guess Donald blowing up Silo 1 was the big action moment, but it felt like that belonged to Jules as the true protagonist. 

I really struggled to get through the ending. Felt like it lost all momentum when they moved to Silo 17.

"Heinlein's ""The Puppet Masters"". Got to finish one of Heinlein's early novels for today, this being 1951's ""The Puppet Masters"".

In the summer of 2007, unknown to the inhabitants of the Earth, flying saucers carrying slug like creatures have landed and are now attacking the planet and its people. To take over the world the aliens attach themselves on a human host, on their backs, and take control of the nervous system, and use them as a puppet.

Because of this the whole planet is thrown into a quiet chaos. However there a few agents who could be able to save it. Three members of a secret national security agency are on the case investigating a flying saucer sighting in Iowa, and also the disappearance of six operatives.

When they find the city to be completely overrun with the creatures, they try to convince the President about it but fail. Can they manage to stop it in time?

Heinlein's earlier novels, or novel in this case, are much more tighter than his more well known later novels and is just full of action.I can't really help but raise an eyebrow at the really absurd method that they use to identify those who have not been taken over by the slugs. It reads like a script for one of those science fiction films that were popping up in the fifties, though I don't think film studios at the time weren't as likely as keen too adapt this into a script!

But this book also conjures up an intense sense of paranoia. After all it was published during the time of McCarthyism. Oh, and it also drew inspiration from the ""flying saucer' craze that was also happening too. But aside from all that, this is another example of some really fun, and cheesy, science fiction from the 50s!",normal
"Do the hunger games books low key describe the Israeli occupation of Palestine? Israel is like the capitol. They have occupied the 13 districts which is Palestine. In the capitol , people live lavishly and are free whereas in the districts there is misery and people are controlled kind of like the situation in Israel/Palestine. Katnis is like a freedom fighter albeit an accidental one , a symbol of the resistance against the occupying force. The interviewer ( forgot his name but he is hilarious in the films ) represents the western media that does not show the suffering of the districts ( Palestine) and glosses over what the Capitol (Israel) does.

Before people came at me with the antisemite rhetoric, I have no issue with regular jews and regular Israelis only with the Israeli government/ Zionists that are causing all the suffering in Palestine and now Lebanon. I wonder if Suzanne Collins got her inspiration for her book from this unfortunate 75 years occupation/conflict.",normal

"The Brilliant Disaster by Jim Rasenberger (2011) The Brilliant Disaster by Jim Rasenberger (2011) ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è  
  
I have a lot of thoughts about the contents of this book, and I hope I will be forgiven if I ramble and meander a bit in this review.  
  
Man, what even was the 1960's? What a decade of madness and paranoia. Reading Jim Rasenberger's retelling of the Bay of Pigs event was both thrilling and intriguing. This narrative even moreso shaped how I view the communications, scheming, ideologies and clashes of agendas that exist within our government, especially around regime changes. Combine this with the aura of suspicion and secrecy that the Cold War shrouded the world in, and it makes for some incredible events. Here, Rasenberger centers his concentration around the catastrophe which was the Bay of Pigs.  
  
The main characters in this story consists of some of the heaviest hitters in 20th century history. We have the charmed John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert, and his wife Jaqueline. We have Eisenhower and Nixon. Across the pond we get Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, two boogeymen to 20th century U.S. Presidents. And the terrifying Nikita Khrushchev, head of a Soviet Union locked in a bitter nuclear staring contest with the United States. A clash of ideologies make for Soviet Invasions in Hungary, Czechoslavakia, and later Afghanistan. The contagion of Communism sparks proxy wars in the Koreas, Laos, Vietnam, to name a few. Not to mention a tug of war over Berlin in Germany, and a fevered race to space. The decision-making that goes into these events are blistered with tension, confusion, projection and covert wackiness that makes for an intensely entertaining time period.  
  
Then there is Cuba. To summarize Rathenberger's version of events: a militaristic Fidel Castro overthrows a corrupt Prime Minister in Cuba by the name of Fulgencio Batista, in the late 1950's. While corrupt, Batista had good relationship with then U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a fact that causes the U.S. government to sour on Castro from the beginning. The young Castro tries to make a good first impression with the U.S, even traveling to NY to meet government leaders and tour the city. Eisenhower snubs meeting Castro to play golf, and instead send his VP Richard Nixon to entertain the revolutionary. Castro suspects his unpopularity with the U.S. government, though New Yorkers flock to him everywhere he goes. He finally gets fed up with Nixon and other government members when they repeatedly press him about his opinion on Communism. Fidel leaves America with a bad taste about its leaders.   
  
Fast forward to early 1960 where Castro begins relations with the Soviet Union. Soviet Prime Minister Nikita Khrushchev suspects that Cuba and America are in troubled diplomatic waters, and decides to taunt the U.S. by showing friendliness towards Castro and his lieutenants, including the popular Ernesto 'Che' Guevara. This newfound relationship irks Eisenhower, and he begins plans on how to remove Castro from power covertly. Plans that at points even include the Mafia. Eisenhower in conduct with the C.I.A, formulate a plan to raise an organic Cuban expeditionary force made up of anti-Castro rebels, train them in Central America with American special ops, equip them with American weapons and aircraft, and help them launch an Invasion on Cuba. The problem here is that in 1960, Eisenhower was in his last year in office, and his Vice President Nixon was locked in a tight race with a young, popular, upstart Democratic Nominee in John F. Kennedy. For a smooth transition of this plan to work, Nixon would need to win the Presidency in 1961. He does not.  
  
The crux of the problems of the Bay of Pigs Invasion occur at the start when Kennedy inherits this operation from Eisenhower, an operation scheduled to go down in April merely 3 months into Kennedy's Presidency. As CIA directors, and Pentagon officials scramble to catch Kennedy up to speed, I don't believe Kennedy himself, or his cabinet members, really ever understand the parameters of the operation. The CIA under Eisenhower had planned a daytime operation meant to land the Cuban rebels on the beaches with a show of force consisting of disguised American airpower, surprising and shocking Castro's forces, and stirring up the Cubans to rise up and rebel against Castro's administration. Kennedy never really seems to grasp the intent of this operation, and begins changing the plans to fit his view. He wants a covert nighttime infiltration, with limited airpower, to secretly grow the uprising from within. From the start he, and the CIA he inherited become locked in a power struggle over how the operation is to unfold. And there isn't really enough time to iron it all out.  
  
Questions arise out of reading this book that I find baffling, and why this era is so interesting. Why was the CIA and Eisenhower so sure that the Cubans would rise up against Castro, a notion Castro had nipped in the bud anyway by jailing possible dissenters? Why didn't Kennedy just cancel the operation altogether, a plan he never truly felt good about? Why didn't the U.S. see that every time they snubbed Castro, they pushed him closer to the Soviet Union and to Communism? A fear that would eventually manifest itself due to U.S. paranoia.   
  
The Brilliant Disaster is an intense day-by-day, play-by-play narrative that will leave you wanting to learn more about the Cold War. Jim Rasenberger is a fantastic storyteller, and presents an easy to read page turner on an amazing era of politics and ideology. Pair this with Steve Coll's Ghost Wars, and treat yourself to an intense ride on a political landscape that still mystifies us even today. ",normal

"I can't get enough of the unhinged female protagonist I don‚Äôt know about you, but I love books with an unlikeable female protagonist. This trope has been around for a while now, but its shape and meaning has transformed under the guise of an ever-changing society. Throughout history, the chaotic female character has been used to fight back against the ideals and norms of society when it comes to what‚Äôs expected of us as women. You might be familiar with Charlotte in The Yellow Wallpaper or Mr. Rochester‚Äôs first wife Bertha in Jane Eyre.¬†

The unhinged female protagonist doesn‚Äôt stop there. We have an array of modern day equivalents. Take the show Fleabag, for example. The character is angry, brushing off anyone who tries to help her through as she battles with grief. She has no filter and uses humor as a defense mechanism. There‚Äôs the book Nightbitch, about a woman dealing with the struggles of her new life as an isolated mother. She misses her life as an artist, before she had a child. Throughout the story, we follow her as she evolves into an angry, feral dog-like being. The book is depicted by many as a metaphor for postnatal depression. Finally, Irina from Boy Parts is a self-destructive, unlikeable narcissist who commits some awful acts. I didn‚Äôt like Irina at all, in fact I found her to be an appalling person, and yet I still found her a wholly fascinating character.¬†

For some reason, these characters draw us in. From the murders they commit to the awful words they say, there‚Äôs just something about the way they are that makes them so thrilling to read about.

Perhaps it‚Äôs the fact that they challenge what‚Äôs expected of them. As women, we‚Äôre often told to tone it down, smile more, be less of this and more of that. Why can‚Äôt we just‚Ä¶ be? And that‚Äôs exactly what these characters accomplish. They resonate with us because they are empowered. Yes, their actions may be more on the extreme end of the spectrum, with their murders and what not. But, you have to admit, having a female protagonist who isn‚Äôt afraid to go after what she wants makes for a riveting read.

Do you enjoy the unhinged female character trope? If so, what is it that draws you in?

"Catch 22: I think I finally figured out how Milo's syndicate works So Milo buys eggs for 7c a piece and sells them for 5c a piece and makes a profit. How?      


He reveals that he actually buys eggs at 1c a piece at Sicily and sells them at Malta for 4.5c a piece. He then buys them back from Malta at 7c a piece and sells them at the mess hall for 5c a piece.     

So his balance sheet looks like:       
-1c        
+4.5c          
-7c           
+5c          
-----               
+1.5c        

In other words, he makes a profit of 3.5c at Malta and loses 2c at the mess hall, thus making a net profit of 1.5c a piece.         

Why doesn't he buy from Sicily for 1c a piece and sell for 5c a piece directly for a net profit of 4c a piece???       
He wants to hide the real source of eggs: i.e. Sicily. If he does this he'll have to reveal to the military that he's buying eggs for 1c a piece from Sicily. Then everyone would buy for 1c a piece at Sicily instead of buying from him. By keeping Sicily a secret, everyone has two options now: Buy from Malta at 7c a piece or buy from Milo at 5c a piece. Obviously everyone chooses Milo.       

The sellers at Malta can sell to Milo at 7c a piece or sell to the officers directly at 5c a piece, obviously they sell to Milo.       



If this still doesn't make sense to you, think of it this way: Milo's complicated transactions are just sharing the profit. Eggs are bought from the source (farmers) at 1c a piece and sold to the officers (who eat them) at 5c a piece for a net profit of 4c. Out of this, Malta keeps a profit of 2.5c, and Milo keeps a profit of 1.5c. He could try to keep all the profit for himself, but then he would be exposing Sicily.          


It goes even deeper. We don't know if the middle man in Malta actually exists. If the middle man is Milo himself with a different name, the profit made by the middle man is also the profit made by Milo, thus his net profit is the maximum possible 4c a piece.         

He doesn't even have to pay for transporting the eggs, since the military pays for all that. They do this because they think getting the soldiers eggs at 5c a piece is worth the transport costs. Milo also uses the transport paid for by Military for his other businesses which is an added bonus.",normal
"Trigger Tool for Book Clubs? Just wondering if there are any websites where you can look up common triggers to make it easier to plan books for a book club at work. This is supposed to be a silly fun club, so I obviously don't want to make a coworker uncomfortable by picking a book that makes them unwilling or unable to participate.",normal
"This continued discourse around trigger warnings is strange to me. I don‚Äôt know if this is true for other social platforms, but on spaces like X, Instagram, and Threads, there seems to be a cyclical discourse on the use of trigger warnings in books. For whatever reason, this topic tends to get people really heated, and some people feel like the request of trigger warnings is a major affront to the author and to the very concept of literature itself. I‚Äôve also seen people state that they refuse to read books where authors have included them, and I just‚Ä¶don‚Äôt understand that stance?

I‚Äôm currently a senior medical student in the U.S., and I‚Äôm interested in specializing in neuropsychiatry. I‚Äôve gotten some good exposure to mood disorders in my training thus, so I feel like I‚Äôve developed a decent understanding on the nature of PTSD and how difficult it can be for some patients to manage (and there‚Äôs always more for me to learn, of course. Our faculty members don't call us lifelong-learners for nothing!). Because I currently hope to work in such an emotionally sensitive field, I‚Äôm really big on meeting people where they're at, approaching their needs with a sense of compassion, and trying to take time to understand why they have certain needs and how best those needs can be addressed.

Now, what does all that have to do with trigger warnings? Well, the primary purpose of trigger warnings is to inform readers of certain subject matter that will make an appearance in the book, so taht readers can make an informed decision about whether the story is appropriate for them to read. This is particularly important for folks with PTSD, because they can‚Äôt always predict what kind of physiological and/psychological reactions they have to certain topics, so they‚Äôd rather just stay safe and avoid topics that will lead to panic attacks, anxiety attacks, and other disproportionate reactions.

A less extreme example is myself: I can‚Äôt psychologically tolerate horror stories. Whenever I consume horror stories, I have increased difficulty with falling asleep (lasting at least a week or more). This is bad news for me, because I already struggle with insomnia at baseline and use several sleep aids. So‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt read horror stories. 

Now, am I probably missing out on some great horror books? Yeah, totally. 

But I don‚Äôt consider the expectation for me to consume every great story out there more important than my need for a good night‚Äôs rest. Any doctor you know will tell you that medical school can be very energy-draining, and my body every minute of sleep it can get, so I‚Äôm more than happy to eliminate anything that interferes with my sleep/my ability to fall asleep, even at the cost of missing out on a good book. I wish this wasn‚Äôt the case, but I‚Äôm not going to suffer through sleepless nights just so I can have some kind of street cred in saying that I read horror books. I'm a big proponent of self-care, and I don't want to spend every day of my life feeling sleep-deprived, so I do what I gotta do. Sue me, I guess.

Now, for some rebuttals to common arguments against trigger warnings:

* ***‚ÄúTrigger warnings spoil the story!‚Äù***

They really don‚Äôt. They're just vague warning about the broad subject matter, not a detailed description of the exact way that the topics manifest in the story and which characters they affect. They can be styled it like the viewer discretion messages at the beginning of visual media, which, to the best of my knowledge, no one has ever had an issue over spoilers with.

* ***‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt predict everything that will trigger someone!‚Äù***

And you're absolutely right. Good thing the only expectation surrounding trigger warnings is to include obvious/major/common-sense ones (eg. rape, suicide, domestic violence) and not necessarily everything under the sun. 

Now, will there be some people with some really niche triggers? Absolutely. Will there be unreasonable people who get mad at the author for not being aware of their specific existence, and not having intimate knowledge of a stranger's niche trigger? sure. But just because *some* people will have unreasonable reactions to this topic doesn't necessarily mean that we should forego the idea all together. 

* ***‚ÄúTrigger warnings dissuade people from engaging with topics that challenge them!‚Äù***

The people for whom trigger warnings are important are typically not using them because they have something against literature that challenges them. They‚Äôre usually doing it because certain topics can trigger disproportionate physiological/psychological reactions that are hard to predict and difficult to control, so they‚Äôre avoiding these topics as part of the management of their mental well-being. There‚Äôs nothing wrong or shameful about prioritizing your psychological health over a theoretical need to ‚Äòchallenge yourself‚Äô, and there are plenty of books that readers can use to ‚Äòchallenge‚Äô their ethics/philosophies/critical thinking without needlessly forcing themselves to endure additional mental trauma. A challenge doesn't need to be traumatizing in order to be a challenge. 

* ***‚ÄúI write books for adults. Adults should be able to handle any topic no problem!‚Äù***

Adults are not a monolith, and the cognition and psychology of every adult differs. Not all of them have the emotional/mental capacity to handle certain topics and still feel well afterwards, and their decision to not engage with these topics doesn‚Äôt make them any less adult. In fact, I consider it quite mature to have the self-awareness needed to recognize that you have psychological limitations regarding certain subject matter. I suspect that the world would be a much better place if more adults were willing and/or able to self-reflect on their psyche. 

Additionally, informed decision-making is a professional standard for many fields, and I view trigger warnings as being akin to that: you‚Äôre giving adult readers the info they need to make informed decisions about the stories they consume, and whatever decision they ultimately come to is their business. If you genuinely feel like they are going to suffer consequences from avoiding their triggers, then those consequences are also their business. You can't claim that trigger warnings is 'babying readers' and then simultaneously baby readers from whatever outcomes result from their decision to not engage with a certain story. I'm also yet to see any proof that avoiding serious psychological triggers leads to significant decline in literacy and other negative outcomes, but I'm open-minded, so if you've got any sources for me to check out, I am all ears. 

* ***‚ÄúThe only way to overcome your fears is by confronting them. Avoiding them gives them more power/makes you weak, etc.‚Äù***

This particular argument is extremely arrogant. It's really not your place to force certain types of fear-management methods onto others. Not only can every fear *not* be effectively managed with repeat exposure, but even when exposure therapy is done for things like phobias and some manifestations of PTSD, the therapy is typically done in a structured and controlled environment in the presence of qualified professionals. Why? Because said professionals understand that the triggering of certain traumas can sometimes be severe and require elevated management. Therefore, I think it‚Äôs inappropriate and a little callous to just casually tell people to ‚Äòfix‚Äô their PTSD with repeat exposure, as if that treatment is just a cute little magic trick that can fix anything. For casual phobias, this might not be that big of a deal, but for people with PTSD and other trauma-based disorders, it can become serious. Therefore, I think that people should be a little more mindful of just casually suggesting exposure therapy to everyone like it's no big deal.

* ***‚ÄúIf people avoid certain books because of trigger warnings, they‚Äôll miss out on great books!‚Äù***

Please. I‚Äôve seen people avoid books for far less: unappealing covers, specific tropes that they don't like, seeing the genre as being inherently inferior (eg. adult fantasy readers turning their nose up at YA fantasy, people turning their nose up at Romance/romantasy), the author being a woman/a person of color/part of the LGBTQ+ community/having a specific political alignment/etc., using certain details about the book to come to the premature conclusion that the story is 'woke trash', etc. 

Not to mention how subjective the word ‚Äògood‚Äô is. What are the chances that the ‚Äògood‚Äô books you swear that everyone needs to read are universally considered to be good? Even the classics and the ‚Äògreat authors‚Äô of our current generation have people who think that they're a waste of time, so it‚Äôs very possible that even if a reader were to ignore the trigger warning, the book would still not have been worth reading. 

It‚Äôs also worth noting that not every assessment of a trigger warning results in a decision to not read the book. Sometimes, the trigger warnings are used as a chance for the reader to mentally prepare themselves to consume that kind of story. They‚Äôll still read the book anyway, but when the difficult subject matter comes up, they‚Äôll be prepared to handle it. 

* ***‚ÄúI hate trigger warnings so much, and I avoid books that contain them!‚Äù***

If you complain that people who avoid books because of triggers are missing out on good books, but then you also say that you refuse to read certain books just for having the warnings, then ‚Äòhypocritical‚Äô is the only appropriate term to use here.

I also cannot emphasize enough how much you don‚Äôt need to read the trigger warnings if *you* personally don‚Äôt want to.  Getting angry at the trigger warning just for merely being there seems a little silly to me, and looking down on authors for being courteous enough to include them seems even sillier. Trigger warnings are there for the people who need them. If you don‚Äôt need them, great! Just flip the page and start reading the book. It doesn‚Äôt need to be this complicated. After all, you also don‚Äôt need every allergy warning that‚Äôs on a food box or every epilepsy warning in a music performance video, but you accept their presence there because you have the discernment needed to understand that some people *do* need them, and that their presence yields a net benefit with very minimal harm (if any).

TL;DR - Mental health continues to be stigmatized/not taken seriously. Trigger warnings are here to help readers make informed decisions about the content they consume. The visceral anger towards the concept of trigger warnings feels inappropriate for that their intended purpose is.

I have a feeling that the comments under this post might turn into a shit show, so forgive me in advance if I‚Äôm not able to reply to everyone. And to the user who's inevitably going to make a wisecrack about ""what if I personally get triggered by trigger warnings? üòèüòèüòè""......allow me to inform you in advance that this joke is not nearly as clever as you think it is.

"My issue with the four agreements First off, if this book has helped you, that's genuinely wonderful. I do really like how compassionate and optimistic it is. I don't want to discount anyone's experiences, because often what people need is different. 

However, I have heard this touted as one of the ""actually good"" self help books, an alternative to the grifters and false promises. I don't think the author is a grifter, I don't know anything about him, but I don't think this book is an exception to the issues with self-help. 

My problem is that it's so individualistic. It perpetuates this idea that happiness is something you create for yourself independent of anyone else, and that what people think of you doesn't matter at all. This is quite a common idea in modern culture but it goes against our nature as social creatures. The book feels like it's against the very idea of a social contract, the concept that we all owe things to other. (also, seems kind of dubious that ancient Toltec wisdom just happens to align with modern western individualist values) 

Like take this quote from the chapter ""don't take anything personally"": ""You may even tell me, 'Miguel, what you are saying is hurting me.' But it is not what I am saying that is hurting you; it is that you have wounds that I touch by what I have said. You are hurting yourself."" But what if they are pointing out something that you legitimately need to work on? This seems antithetical to self-improvement. Especially because the author spent a whole chapter talking about how harmful our words can be to others. Sure, often people's criticism can come from their own personal issues, but we shouldn't always assume that. 

I think that the idea of self-improvement as an independent mission is inherently misguided. We can't do anything without other people. Maybe the agreements we make should be about compassion and community. 

I would genuinely really like to hear people's thoughts on this, and if they agree or disagree. (Also, if you know any self help books that are more focused on community, feel free to recommend them!) ",normal
"Do you feel emotional over classic books? Should preface by saying l'm aware 'classic novels aren't for everyone, and you should feel no obligation to read them' as a rule - however, I adore classics. Purely for the intellectual stimulation and insight into the human condition, and for studying the use of the English language itself over time (though l'm not a native speaker). For more plot-focused stories, I‚Äôm quite content in just enjoying where the story takes me as well.

That being said, most of the time, I feel little to no attachment to characters within classic novels.

This is particularly atypical for me as l'm an admittedly over-sensitive/easily emotional individual. When I was only a few years younger (before studying Literature), I could be compelled to blush and giggle, laugh out loud, and sob my eyes out reading just one book, though I never read classics back then.

This isn't to say I no longer feel emotions now that I read classics, but that they are far more muted and cerebral in nature. Do you have the same experience? Can you provide me any insight or advice into feeling greater emotional attachment to classic novels?",normal

"The Familiar by Leigh Bardugo  (Contains spoilers for the ending) 

I just read The Familiar for the second time and I love the book... except for the ending. It felt way too neatly wrapped up. All the bad guys got their comeuppance and the good guys lived happily ever after. And everyone's fate correlated very neatly with the scale of their actions. I don't have a problem with happy endings, but this one just felt *too* neat. For example:

Hualit: I think it's deliberately ambiguous whether she's a ""good guy"" or not, but Luzia very explicitly (and justifiably!) resents her for living a life of luxury while refusing to help Luzia, instead leaving her to live in abject poverty and suffering abuse at the hands of her employers. And it just so happens that on the coach ride to her death, Hualit muses regretfully on her selfish unwillingness to help her niece. That just feels too on the nose to me. But that's not even the extent of it: she's then confronted with Victor's two murderous henchmen and it turns out one of them is pretty uncomfortable with killing her while the other displays no such scruples. The reluctant henchman is allowed to live, but Hualit manages to kill the bloodthirsty one. Hualit, who may be selfish but she isn't cruel, dies quickly, but the evil henchman dies slowly and miserably. But wait, there's more! An emerald Hualit had hidden in her dress finds its way into the belly of a fish and is found by a woman who promptly sells it and uses the money to escape her abusive husband. (That's a bit much, but ok.) *And* said abusive husband chokes to death on a bone from that very same fish that night. (Seriously??)

Valentina: Valentina starts off as a very abusive employer but from the very beginning of the story, Luzia feels a sort of kinship with her because she recognizes that they are both trapped and miserable by virtue of being women in a highly patriarchal society. Valentina grows kinder to Luzia as the story goes on and finally redeems herself by standing up to her husband to try to help Luzia escape and then sending her clean clothes and money for food when she is imprisoned. As a reward for her redemption, she is given a fulfilling sex life, relationship, and social life. 

Marius: Marius also abused Luzia, but unlike his wife he was too cowardly to help her when she was in danger and as punishment for that, his wife leaves him and he ends up in self-imposed exile from his own house because he can't stand her new friends. 

The villains: Victor's wife leaves him and he dies terrified and alone, and Fortun loses the majority of his magic powers. 

Luzia: I have no issue with the fact that she managed to save herself and Santangel. What I *do* take issue with is her ageless immortality that appears out of nowhere, a *deus ex machina* in the very last chapter. It was established that she could effectively make herself immortal because she can heal herself, but we'd never seen any evidence of her not aging. In fact, she seems to have aged perfectly normally until now. It's true that Teoda stopped aging so one could argue that maybe that just happens to magic users sometimes, but Teoda stopped aging when she was a child and it's awfully convenient that it happened to Luzia when she was an attractive young woman. 

This wrapped up with a bow, everyone gets their just desserts sort of ending feels appropriate for a children's fairytale and doesn't match the tone or themes of the rest of the book. It's a shame, because Bardugo is clearly a very talented writer and the characters and the rest of the story were phenomenal. ",normal
"Blood Meridian I have just finished reading this book today and wow, I am breathless.

But the question I‚Äôm burning to know is what were other‚Äôs interpretations of the ending‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm personally only a fan of ambiguous endings if they add to the reading experience, and I definitely think that is not only warranted and valid but absolutely necessary and integral in this case for proper reader engagement with the text‚Ä¶ however I haven‚Äôt consolidated what I think.

"""The Prince"" by Machiavelli has me Dazed and Confused - Reflections I have had this book on my list for some time now, but I just kind of dreaded coming to it because I felt like it might be a bit tedious. Someone close to me recommended it as a ""step by step manual on how to be a good ruler"", so I decided to finally give it a shot. 

I was pleasantly surprised that it was not tedious at all, I actually enjoyed reading it quite a lot. However, I am a bit ashamed of how long it took me to finish this book, considering its size--three months to be exact--but life got in the way, I've been very busy. 

I have six main reflection points on this book:

1. Although it was introduced to me as ""princehood for dummies"", someone else told me there is a theory that he actually wrote this book as a critique of those in power. Considering that he wrote it from exile and it wasn't published until years after his death, I guess there is a chance that this might be true? (I understand that there are many other factors contributing to its late publishing, I was just thinking out loud). Although we will never know the true intentions of the book, I think it can be interpreted either way. Wanted to hear the reddit community's thoughts on this though. 

2. I mainly enjoyed this book because I treated it as historical ""Tea"". I believe I have probably missed some of the references in this book despite the fact that the version I read had explanations and historical context included. But my historical knowledge has sort of dwindled, I studied the history of the middle ages back in my junior and senior years of highschool, but I don't remember much of it. I wish I did for the purposes of having a better understanding of the book. 

3. One of the main themes that I found intriguing and I believe has probably been beaten to death by every political sciences major in my vicinity is the theme of immorality. Machiavelli more than once justifies immoral acts and also very openly and honestly discusses all those socially taboo and unacceptable aspects of power that I have not seen discussed in this manner previously. I don't know if this is something that other political philosophers have done before him, but to my knowledge he seems to have pioneered it. I find merit in that honesty, and although it was at times very pessimistic and depressing, I think he paints quite the honest picture of power and politics. I couldn't help but think about how these principles still apply to some of the political leaders I have seen in my own country--depressing but interesting. This makes me appreciate his work more as it obviously has some value if it still applies centuries into the future. 

4. Despite much of his advice being very specific to his time--such as all the parts about the different applications of cavalry and infantry forces--I think some of his advice is pretty applicable to a variety of different scales. I don't want to act like a pseudointellectual and act like I am about to apply everything, but I even think that scaled to the corporate environment that I work in, it can apply, and I even tried something and it kind of worked.--fun little experiment, nothing serious. 

5. His last few chapters, he describes fortune as a woman and says she has to be beaten up?? wtf was that about lol. Threw me off a little bit, but sure. 

6. The biblical references were interesting to me. ",normal

"You know a book is good when you spend the next day arguing with the characters in your head What books have you debating the characters (or the author) as you read? Whether it be over their society or their values or their personal choices. In my mind, the best sign a story is compelling is when you just can't stop trying to pick a fight with it. 

I just read The Terraformers by Annalee Newitz, and the whole time, I couldn't stop having imaginary debates with the characters about various aspects of the worldbuilding. This morning I woke up already in the middle of a one-sided discussion about the value of childhood as an institution and developmental stage. In the book, people reproduce in a completely different way that bypasses childhood entirely and I can't help but feel that something of value was lost even as I see that their way has its obvious advantages too.

"I think a large number of classics are funnier than their reputation would suggest. There is this view of classics as being books that are written by literary gods, beyond criticism and highly intellectual. At least that was my perception. 

However, I learned later on, often from people who really enjoyed the classics, people who either had very good teachers or were self-taught, that there was more humor to be found in many famous books. 

So they made me question whether I had to take Shakespeare very seriously. Or Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Or James Joyce's writings. 

Some people say always go to the source and you will find you answers, but the problem is that books and the authors do not exist in a vacuum. Reading a book won't tell you how to read it. 

What is required, I think, is learning more about both the author and their environment.  What was life and society like where they lived? What books were popular at the time? Was the author reacting to certain literary tradition or cultural norms at the time? Who were they writing for? How were they paid?",normal
"I just finished Voices From Chernobyl by Svetlana Alexievich and I don't know what I expected but I didn't expect their ghosts to speak to me. I expected it to be stories from the citizens that were evacuated from Chernobyl but this is done like slave narratives. It's their own words. Heartbreaking, traumatizing, terrifying and honestly naive. They all are so blatant that they were simple people that didn't understand, didn't know the dangers. The stories made me gasp out loud and tear up. If you are an animal lover stories about how liquidators, that's what the soldiers who were sent to Chernobyl were called, had to dispose of them will make you cry. But the animals; cats and dogs and livestock were suffering so much. 

If anyone else has read this I'd be interested in their thoughts. I've read lots of technical books about Chernobyl that give background of nuclear power around the world and especially the disasters Russia experienced before Chernobyl and was familiar with the basic stories because of those books. But reading this side of it, especially the wives of the firefighters absolutely broke me.

"You guys recommended For Whom the Bell Tolls, so I read it and I loved it. About a month ago I made a post praising A Farewell to Arms, claiming it was probably one of my new favorites, and in the replies, many people were recommending ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""The Sun Also Rises"". So, I read For Whom the Bell Tolls, and thank you to everyone who recommended it! Though I didn't love it quite as much as A Farewell to Arms, it was still outstandingly good. 

First off, I love the building of the characters. Most of the book is either conversations about various different subjects, or Robert Jordan thinking to himself. While this sounds like mere ""filler"" (trust me, it wasn't), it built up the realism of the characters and made them so much more interesting. It made them feel like real characters, and not just like holograms to convey a story (which is a complaint I find with a lot of books). Because of so much time being spent with the characters conversing in a cave, it almost has the feeling of actually being there. It has this genuine and authentic feel that makes you understand that this is partially autobiographical! To me, Hemingway had a huge talent for making authentic-feeling stories.

Another thing that impressed me was its suspense. I don't mean scary suspense like Blood Meridian, but more so intense, riveting engagement that keeps you hooked. For the climax of the novel (which I will not spoil), suspense was built up so well. Almost the entire book is technically a lead-up to the climax, but the last 5 or so chapters before the climax are so well built. It puts such a good focus on the character's mental state and every action they do, before they are about to do the main goal of the story. Every action and thought is just described so wonderfully and makes it so amazingly immersive. 

This is all I can think of for now, since I just finished it and I'm still collecting my thoughts, but thank you so much for recommending this everyone! Peace :)",normal
"Is ‚ÄúThe Honey Witch‚Äù by Sydney Shields Worth Persevering?  No spoilers please!

I was so hyped for this book. I adored the concept and I willingly fed into the hype around the release. I also want to preface this by saying that I feel like I am generally able to turn my brain off to mediocre writing. I enjoy Sara J Maas books easily enough, I was a sucker for Twilight as a youth, I have even been invested in fanfic from time to time so I don‚Äôt think I am a ‚Äúsnob‚Äù when it comes to writing. 

But holy shit I am three chapters in and it LITERALLY has put me to sleep! I am so disappointed! I feel like the concept is interesting and some of the prose are decent but I just want to throw this book in a PDF file and edit while I read. 

1. There is ZERO tension. It‚Äôs as though the author is afraid that if she doesn‚Äôt exposit  *before* she provides detail, that the reader will be confused? 

Example: There is a scene where (character) arrives, and we are explicitly told exactly who it is right before the author describes overhearing the conversation the character is having. It removes sense of mystery and just seeks to validate the answer already given. So much of the story is like this! The reader isn‚Äôt allowed to remain curious or confused or (god forbid) SPECULATE for more than a few sentences. 

2. Everything moves so fast. I truly feel like I‚Äôve got whiplash reading this book and I‚Äôm like 30 pages in. The writing feels eager to move at a breakneck pace no matter the scene. What I would consider to be some pretty seemingly significant moments have just been eagerly exposited and handled in only a few pages. Like SLOW DOWN, girlypop. So many things that have happened so far should have me eager to read more but they been thrown out so fast I have no time or interest in caring about them? 

It feels like the author is checking off elements in a list instead of telling a story. I can only hope that the intro is rushed so that we can reach the true ‚Äúmeat and potatoes‚Äù of the story that she is actually interested in writing about. 

I really want to believe that the story gets better but I am losing faith rapidly. 

Was anyone else disappointed by the start of *The Honey Witch*? Does it get better? It is possible that it gets *worse* ???

"I saved about $800 a year because of the library if I count only the books I finished reading, and I save about $2,400 a year if I count every book I read from the library. The library is one of the greatest gifts to humanity. In a year, I finished reading about 52 books. Of these, about 12 were from my personal purchases (physical books and audiobooks), while about 40 came from the library.  So let that sink in, a normal book costs $10 to $15, but I'll assume each book costs $20 because I also borrow textbooks, which are more expensive than ordinary books. So, 40 books at $20 each equals $800. This means I save about $800 a year because of the library. But if I calculate the total number of books I borrowed from the library, both finished and unfinished, I checked my loan history and found that I borrowed about 120 books. That would cost $2,400. So, the library helps me save a lot of money. Now, Youtube, podcasts, audiobooks, ps5, ps4 ,Nintendo Switch consume much of my time.

"Experienced mystery readers: Which mystery/detective books totally surprised you? Like the clues were there but you still didn't see the twists coming? I'm a newbie mystery reader. I am not going to name the book I was reading but only to say it was written by Michael Connelly. This was a few weeks ago.

Anyhow I was quite impressed and talking about the book with some people online. Was having a chat with someone online who called themselves a ""veteran mystery reader"" and they had read the same book. But unlike me, they had been able to guess the ending and that said the twists did not surprise them except one. 

I was impressed by this person's intelligence, but they said that it was actually because the book was not that good at all. Like the one twist that surprised them was basically because the author ""cheated,"" and misled the reader by holding back vital information. So that if you go back and read over what was written, the clues you needed to see the twist coming weren't there. 

So I was thinking about that book again today and decided to make a post to see what experienced mystery readers would consider books that are full of twists but they're done very well. Like if you go back and read it over again, you can see the clues and you don't feel cheated. but despite your experience, you did not guess right and was pleasantly surprised by the twists and ending.

"No Country for Old Men by Cormac McCarthy  I have read Blood Meridian first and have seen the movie multiple times. So I was excited to get into this one.  

I have to say the dialogue in this book was amazing. To see how all the characters spoke to each other plainly. Such as Moss‚Äôs relationship with his wife. And the sheriff trying to figure out what happened. 

This book gives an anxious and paranoid feeling throughout. You see a hunter becoming the hunted. I sort of made the connection that this was Cormac‚Äôs take on the most dangerous game. 

First off Cormac McCarthy knows how to write villains!!!! Anton Chigurgh was evil!!!!! He was on a mission through and through. To see him just plain out kill and be ready to take someone‚Äôs life on a coin toss or their beliefs was quite insane. What resonated me the most is when he makes to Moss‚Äôs wife and he said it is what it is. That was so sad she did not deserve that. 

Bell was a lot more fleshed out. His WW2 story about running away. Now him solving this crime he wants some sort of closure. By far my favorite character. 

Moss was an idiot. I would have been in Jamaica by that point. I don‚Äôt know if chigurh would have found me but who cares. 

I think McCarthy does a great job with character development. Both of his books had master class villains. It‚Äôs such a cruel cruel world he paints. ",normal

"Defending Cozy Fiction Recently I‚Äôve got into the habit of reading cozy fantasy ‚Äì relaxing stories without violence and with little to no stakes. Travis Baldree, Becky Chambers etc.

I find cozy fiction to be a most welcomed break from reality, as well as from the traditional narratives of popular fiction: action, crime, mystery etc. It is understandable in that regard, that many people may find cozy fiction boring or pointless, because, why read a story that has no obstacles or action?

But I‚Äôd like to defend cozy fiction in that regard. We live in a world that is constantly moving, most of us in first-world capitalist societies, where the hunt for opportunities and for a better life is constant, and ends up eating people from the inside. Combine this with the various threats of modern life, like political polarization, climate crisis, social and economic instability, a crushing work culture, and I believe it is pretty understandable why people turn to a book like *Legends & Lattes* to relax and spend their evening.

Action and drama are great, but coziness and calmness should also be part of our daily lives and our reading culture. It is why many people play Minecraft or watch Miyazaki‚Äôs films. A story doesn‚Äôt need to have great action and/or violence to be compelling. Sometimes is better to take a step back and enjoy the small things in life: drinking a coffee at your favorite caf√©, reading a book you like, or going in a stroll through the woods with your robot friend while talking philosophy. Our lives tend to be quite action packed and stressful ‚Äì there‚Äôs no need for the entirety of our fiction to be the same.

Today cozy fiction represents a generally small part of the overall literary world I believe, and I hope it will expand in the years to come. We‚Äôve seen enough stories about war, violence and apathy. It‚Äôs time to hear stories about sunshine, peacefulness and empathy.

This had to be one of the most densest books I have read in all time. I bought it in January and just finished this. It felt a bargain though as two books in one. One about planning, marketing and execution of an urban development. As well as one of the craziest and delusional killers of American history. 

I was a fan of Burnham. I thought he was efficient leader and had a great vision. I wanted him to cross paths with Holmes! I felt like the other architects were also like we gotta get in our bags our names are on the line. I really liked how this book painted Chicago. I felt with them finding out they got the worlds fair, building the Ferris wheel, root‚Äôs wedding and funeral, and the Buffalo bill show bringing in the biggest crowds! 

I felt the opening with burnham being on the Olympic we knew the painter was on the titanic was so sad! 

Now Holmes was highly insane. Yet his debts were his downfall was crazy. He just thought he could keep getting away with it. He was out here stealing wives. You feel bad about the statistic of all the young women who were lost in Chicago during that time. I think what scared me the most was his big furnace and that poor girl‚Äôs footprint in the vault. I did know most of his story before on the morbid podcast. But I felt it was quite definitive in Holmes story. Im glad he got caught. I sort of expected more with his hotel.  

By the end of the book I started to appreciate the world‚Äôs fair. All its accomplishments and what came of it. The people coming together to make something great. All that it did for urban development. Chicago must be phenomenal.

normal people and little life parallels I am a huge fan of the book little life and I recently read normal people by sally rooney. and i feel like marianne and jude have SO MANY PARALLELS between each other. like as someone who has read both the books and jude‚Äôs character has just stuck with me like no other and after reading marianne today i can sense the underlying worthlessness and the feeling of not being enough for anyone especially when the people who you grow up with betray you so badly. i do understand jude‚Äôs issues were actually fucked up on so many levels but they both have the same energy about them. i am just very happy normal people didn‚Äôt end the way little life ended for him. both of them deserve so much better than what they got,normal
"Finished my 3rd Adam Neville book, Cunning Folk I had previously read The Ritual and Last Days. Both of which I think I preferred.

Reading Cunning Folk I actually was under the impression it must have been one of his earlier books. The prose was too much for little finished product. A lot of flowery language and poeticisms in an attempt to capture the dreamy, noxious, and haunted atmosphere...but instead of really imparting that feeling to me, it just fell flat. Instead of really having a picture painted or feelings imparted, it was just murky and long winded in places.

I also felt the pacing and tension building in Last Days was much better.

It kind of reminded me Anne Rice's prose shift in Tale of the Body Thief. I feel she had been very successful and self-assured so she started being more grand in her descriptions, when really pruning and being more exacting would've been better.

I get what he was trying to do...trying to lure the reader into the disgruntled haze of impending doom that his character was in mentally, but whereas other authors have been able to successfully do that for me, with this style I just felt a bit bored and confused...not confused in a good way, but just detached from the story. 

However, someone else on here told me Cunning Folk was their favorite of his...so it truly is subjective. To each their own!

And on a more positive note, I still loved the concepts and basic plot. I really like folk horror and Neville always provides. 

I might take a break from his books until next year, but I definitely want to check more of his folk horror ones out.",normal

"Finished The Book Thief ‚Äì and it left me in tears  I just finished The Book Thief, and I didn‚Äôt expect it to leave me this emotional. I went in knowing it was a sad book, but no book has made me this emotional since *Flowers for Algernon*, but as I read, I found myself crying throughout the book. It wasn‚Äôt even one big moment‚ÄîI‚Äôd be reading, and tears would well up, falling here and there as different parts of the story unfolded.

I didn‚Äôt connect with every character, but I related to a few specific traits. Liesel‚Äôs love for books and her regrets of not taking action (not kissing Rudy) really hit home for me. It made me remember all the regrets I have for not taking action in some situations.

Hans Huberman‚Äôs quiet, steady nature, the way he handled everything with such calmness and care‚Äîmade me appreciate him and I aspire to become the kind of person he was.

The book started out feeling so wholesome (after the initial sadness), but as it progressed, it got darker while still keeping some of those heartfelt moments. It made me think about how words can both save and destroy, and how some relationships can provide light even in the darkest times. I guess it‚Äôs one of those stories where you don‚Äôt realize how much it‚Äôs affecting you until you‚Äôve finished, and then it all comes crashing down.

Also, recommend some books like it that are a roller-coaster of emotions if you can.",normal
"The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes Just wondering if anyone had read and appreciated the last anthology of Holmes short stories as much as I do? The collection is not as often mentioned as the novels or the earlier stories published in magazines. Understandable I guess as those are from a time when the character was fresh in the public mind - and it seems public knowledge/perception (such as exists) is still influenced by the Victorian perception of the time line of the Holmes stories today.

However Imo, the last anthology is as good as anything that went before and The Illustrious Client, Sussex Vampire, Creeping man and Thor Bridge are standouts.",normal

"A world of weird: A.E Van Vogt's ""The Silkie"". Well another day and another very strange scifi novel read. The novel completed today is A.E Van Vogt's ""The Silkie"".

A Silkie, in Van Vogt's mind, is a creature that can easily move through space, water and land. They can think like a computer, etherically communicate, and can even change their form in order to suit certain changing situations.

But were they actually what they were all to be? Are they actually a creation of man to be heirs or helpers, or ""ringers"" for some world in outer space or conspiracy against humanity?

The Silkie's themselves don't actually know either.

Van Vogt was one of several golden age writers I was really interested in reading, and even got some of his material on a wish list. And this novel marks the first time I've gotten to read some of it.

""The Silkie"" is a pretty short one, only about 191 pages. The story is really fast paced, tight and also full action. And it's also pretty strange! Like it's pretty dreamlike and hallucinatory for a novel written by a golden age writer like Van Vogt, though I can pretty well grasp that much of his work is pretty much like that. And of course he was cited by Philip K. Dick as an influence. Plus he was also a strange person giving his fascination with certain theories, even including the whole Dianetic's thing that was conceived by the infamous L. Ron Hubbard (also a science fiction writer).

But back to the book. ""The Silkie"" has also this feel to it that really reminds of the scifi tv shows of the late fifties and the sixties (the book was published in 1969 after all), you know things like Rod Serling's ""The Twilight Zone"" and Gene Roddenberry's original ""Star Trek"" (of which I saw a few episodes of) and such like. It seems that the inspiration for the story came from the legend of the selkie, a shape changing creature of Celtic myth. I probably can guess that Van Vogt came across this legend at some point and right then and decided to write a science fiction book inspired by it.

""The Silkie"" is a pretty strange book, and very short, but I found it to be very enjoyable. Still got another of his books that I have yet to read and really hope to get more of them soon!",normal

"The Name of the Rose  Does anybody else get the feeling the monks talk just like professors and graduate students?  I feel like u can replace ""monastery"" with ""university,"" ""monk"" with ""assistant professor,"" ""abbot"" with ""dean,"" the different religious observances with class, etc. and the book would still mostly make sense.  

The book overall was really amazing, but the last few pages was disappointing, though I find this to be true of most good books in English. William is really smart but fails horribly in everything he undertakes. Bernard Gui is evil and bad and succeeds in all his endeavors. Adso is sweet but he was directly responsible for the fire in which many innocents died or were injured. He keeps flipping over the lamp which he already did at least once before. I don't know why he couldn't let William fight Jorge alone while holding the lamp SAFELY at a distance. I'm sure William was capable of taking down a blind 80 something who was busy committing suicide and probably already further debilitated from actively eating linen soaked in poison. I think William is right, adso is stupid. 

The other thing I didn't understand was why didn't William and Adso try to save Abo and instead chose to stick around and have a long conversation with Jorge? Was it just because Jorge said Abo was beyond help? That seems like a flimsy reason that borders on excuse to leave Abo to his fate while William tried to get the book from Jorge. 

Lastly, was the thing with the book and Jorge an open secret among the monks? What was the deal with Alinardo and the Italian faction going to see Abo just before the night of the fire? Did they know Jorge was behind everything and feel that Jorge had finally gone too far? Or was it because the position of librarian had opened up and they wanted an Italian in that position? 

I wish Eco had gone deeper and further with the plot around abbey politics and the position of librarian. But it felt like the book ended just as that aspect of the book was being developed. 

Nonetheless the book was a page turner on top of being super educational. I'm planning on reading Foucault's Pendulum next.",normal
"White Noise by Don DeLillo and the internet I just read this book and it struck me that many of the passages from it feel like they're about the internet. Here's something one character says: 

""TV offers incredible amounts of psychic data. It opens ancient memories of world birth, it welcomes us into the grid, the network of little buzzing dots that make up the picture patterns. There is light, there is sound. I ask my students, 'What more do you want?' Look at the wealth of data concealed in the grid, in the bright packaging, the jingles, the slice of life commercials, the products hurling out of darkness, the coded messages and endless repetitions, like chants, like mantras. 'Coke is it, coke is it, coke is it.' The medium practically overflows with sacred formulas if we can remember how to respond innocently and get past our irritation, weariness and disgust."" 

There's an even larger mass of data on the internet today than on TV in the 80s. The description of mantras especially applies to tiktok, in which certain sounds go viral and are endlessly repeated. 

There's also the element of disasters being broadcast widely, which is again even more applicable on the internet. You see videos of horrific tragedies all the time. 

Another theme in the book is the blurring of reality and simulation. The internet spreads so much fake news, especially stuff that makes people scared. Like, Qanon is a whole community of people living in this fantasy world completely disconnected from anyone they know IRL. People live fake lives online too, it's so easy to lie on the internet. And there's also parasocial relationships which the internet lends itself to very well.

Anyways, I'm curious if anyone else has thoughts on how this book connects to the modern internet and consumer culture. ",normal
"Do you usually write book reviews after you finish reading a book? I always do, and it really helps me remember the story and material in the book better. It allows me to reflect on the themes and characters in a deeper way.  I share my book reviews on Goodreads and Amazon after I finish reading books. Whether they are fiction, nonfiction, or textbooks, I write reviews for every type of book. And it really feels good to share my thoughts and opinions with people around the world. When I Google a book name, Amazon and Goodreads always come up at the top, so many people can read my review.  And I remember the story better because when I write a review, I have to think carefully about the plot and ponder its themes and characters again. This process encourages me to engage deeply with the material.  It helps me identify the lessons I learned and the emotions I felt while reading.

"That One Book I Loved Before... But Now Can‚Äôt Stand I recently re-read The Secret Dreamworld of a shopaholic by Sophie Kinsella and I certainly didn't like it, like the first time around.

And I get it, that this is the theme, but the way she describes or rather excuses her choices is just appalling to me, her behavior reminds me of a kid

"Great villians: M 'lady 
In the context of great villains of all time, I think ""milady"" is overlooked. She's a great spy who fools and challenges the musketeers through 3 books. They never get a handle on her because she takes advantage of the assumptions about her - she is assumed to be weak within the culture, she plays against trope. She is conniving, clever, and ruthless in an environment that expects her to be simple, naive and demure. She is often one step ahead of Athos and even Richelieu. I don't see her talked about a lot, but I think she is one of the greatest villians of all time.

"The Glass Castle: What was wrong with her parents? I just finished reading Jeannette Walls'¬†*The Glass Castle*, and it was both an eye-opening and a challenging experience. The book really makes you reflect on things we often take for granted. But it also left me with a lot of questions, particularly about her parents' mental health.

Jeannette's father was an alcoholic and seemed delusional at times, but despite his flaws, I thought he still cared about his children, especially Jeannette. However, that belief was shattered when he allowed her to go with a drunk man, where she was nearly sexually assaulted. When she told his father about it, he showed no remorse, guilt, or anger toward the man. Similarly, he ignored what happened to Brian when he was almost molested by his grandmother (Edit: His dad's mother)

As for Jeannette's mother, she came across as depressed, carrying a lot of regrets, which seemed to contribute to her selfishness and lack of action. When Uncle Stanley tried to assault Jeannette, her mother didn‚Äôt protect her or punish him. Instead, she pitied Stanley, thinking he acted that way because he was lonely. I don‚Äôt understand why her mother didn‚Äôt leave her father, especially when Jeannette suggested it might give them a better future.

At the end of the book, her mother says that life with her husband was ""never boring."" What does that mean? Did she prefer the chaotic and dysfunctional life they lived over a more stable and safe one for herself and her children?",normal
"""An Anonymous Girl"" - I Liked It a LOT I finished Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen's ""An Anonymous Girl"" for the first time a few months ago, and started reading it again a couple nights ago. I forgot how much I liked this book. I find it quite good - if slightly unbelievable. I do CONSTANTLY forget what the characters are supposed to look like, instead substituting the way I see them while I read.

Sarah Pekkanen has become one of my favorite authors over this last year, and while I've read eight or so books of hers now, this one is currently my favorite. 

I will say, the ending kind of fell flat for me. It wasn't BAD, but it wasn't great.

"The rising lack of editing- what is going on? Maybe it's my fault for thinking they'd be good, but I'm honestly shocked at how poorly edited some of the releases from TikTok creators, podcasts hosts or other influencers are. I'm currently reading a new release from a TikTok personality that had a pitch that sounded fun, especially for Halloween, but it's SO let down by the lack of editing or even cohesive flow. The characters smirk, shrug, sigh and slouch so often it sounds like they have physical tics. 

Another release hyped up last year was The Butcher and the Wren, from Morbid cohost Alaina Urqhart, which apparently never had a single critical eye passed over it. It's genuinely one of the worst books I've ever read, the prose and pacing is sloppy and again- barely cohesive. 

Then of course there's the most notable lemon of all that inexplicably gained enough traction to be picked up by a trad pub - Gothikana. Apparently written by Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way, it's like an AI generated text but I wouldn't even give the author enough credit, and it seemed to have absolutely no overhaul before being published. 

There are definitely outliers here- for example All Good People Here is another podcast host author but was much tighter, not full of nonsense passages and irrelevant arm flailing, huffing or smirking.

So truly, WHAT is going on with editing these days? Or is even just proofreading too much to ask for?

"I just finished reading The Fault in Our Stars, and I have to say, the film adaptation does an incredible job of capturing the essence of John Green‚Äôs novel. One of the things I loved most about the book is Hazel Grace Lancaster's voice. She's incredibly relatable, with her sharp wit and deep introspection. Green does a fantastic job of blending humor and heartbreak, making you laugh while also hitting you with profound truths about life and mortality. Hazel‚Äôs perspective on living with cancer and her desire to lead a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life really resonates, especially when you consider how illness can shape identity and relationships.Gus Waters charm and optimism contrast beautifully with Hazel. The way their relationship developed felt really genuine and raw, capturing the intensity of young love amidst the backdrop of their struggles. Green's writing beautifully illustrated their emotional connections, making me root for them.

John Green is already himself known for addressing tough topics in a way that feels accessible and heartfelt. And his ability to articulate the thoughts and feelings of young adults facing difficult realities and expressing it in a beautiful way is of what made me write this review.

"Tess of the D'urbervilles messed me up I admit that I'm not very familiar with the other works of Thomas Hardy other than some of his poems, but recently, I went into Tess of the D'ubervilles completely blind, and boy, did that story like a punch to the gut at every turn. 

I got so mad that Hardy didn't give Tess a happy ending, but he made his point about the moral standards of women in the Victorian era. (Also, on a side note I love the irony of a person named Angel who doesn't treat Tess like an Angel, simply because she got raped, which she had no control over). Furthermore, she's punished every time she tries to ""move up"" the social class, so to speak. I found an intresting fact: the literal meaning of Tess is ""to reap,"" or at least according to Wikipedia. When she violates this fate ordained even within her name, tragedy awaits her in the form of Alec (also another thought: could Alec be in reference to Alexander the Conquerer?). In any case, Tess is one of those few books that really fucked me up.

"Is there a rule somewhere that every audiobook narrator has to have 1 word with a wild mispronounciation? I've noticed that there will be a random word in an audiobook that the narrator will pronounce so strangely it will make me question if I've just been pronouncing it wrong my whole life.

E.g. In the latest Bobiverse book the narrator pronounced 'pergola' like 'burglar' (they said perg-ola, instead of per-go-la). 

Am I going mad? Or is my australian perspective on this word different to other countries?

Edit e.g. [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pJmVLQyd6U&t=4s) is an example of how i've always pronounced it. I'm guessing it's an Australian/NZ thing then?

Either way, i was kind of hoping to get people commenting on weird/different/unexpected pronunciations they'd heard in audiobook narration :p

Looks like we Australians have 'done our own research' on how to pronounce these words (i'm sure there are more):

 * Route/Router",normal
"Babel Let me summarize nearly 800 pages for you: ""colonialism, racism, and sexism are all bad, and were especially bad in 1830s England with the added bonus of classism at Oxford.""

That's it, that's the whole book.

I should have followed my gut around 100-150 pages in when I was thinking ""surely the entire book is not this hamfisted, right?"". No, it is. And I won't even touch on the suspension of disbelief necessary for this argentogravure stuff. Like the entire world is normal, except that? At least with Harry Potter you're allowed to believe the world exists because it's entirely magic, but here it's just this? It didn't resonate.

Back to my main gripe: if you want to be hit over the head every 40 pages or so with ""colonialism bad"", then by all means take the dive. But what did this book teach me that I didn't already know? It's set in 1830s Oxford...of course there are racists, sexists, and classists, and of course these things are bad. What did this explore that hasn't been explored? There was zero subtlety in the entire thing. I felt like I was reading a long form post from r/im14andthisisdeep or something.

The characters were also somehow not believable at all. The only one that felt believable and well written was Ramy.

I've read plenty more that had more to say on the main topics that this book supposedly deals with. Le Pays des Autres comes to mind, also Le Paradis, hell even Where the Crawdads Sing had more to say about class than this and that too was pretty on the nose.

I bought this because the review said it was an exploration of class, race, etc. in a novel setting. It was, instead, nearly 800 pages of being beat over the head with things we already know against a backdrop of a completely absurd plot to which no real effort is given to explain aside from maybe 5 pages like halfway through: ""slight differences in meaning impute what is missing to the surroundings"". Alright I guess.

"Bram Stoker's Dracula is creepy-cozy I wanted to read some spooky books this month. I'm about halfway through Dracula and legitimately surprised how good it is. I love the format of a story told through diary entries, letters, newspaper clippings, doctor's notes, etc. It's such a clever way of creating mystery and mythology, and being creepy without giving too much away. There's a coziness to it despite being genuinely unsettling at times. 

The writing is beautiful and despite its age, the format somehow makes it feel more modern. I guess I had always assumed Dracula would be cheesy and outdated, probably because some of the film adaptations are, well, exactly that.",normal

"I am the college kid who can‚Äôt read I want to read. I want to read the piles of books: classics, fantasy, literature, history on my bookshelf, but a mental block is stopping me. This feeling that I don‚Äôt have enough time or energy. I love the idea of annotating, of having a conversation with a book, but this also holds me back from reading as I don‚Äôt feel like I have the analytical capacity to produce high quality thoughts about the books I want to read. So I don‚Äôt. I fixate a lot on the fact that I‚Äôll never be able to re read something for the first time, and think I might be placing pressure on myself to come up with some grand analysis upon the first sight of a passage, and that failing to do so is an intellectual failure.

The decline in my reading rate coincides with the decline in my mental health, but that‚Äôs not an excuse, nor something I‚Äôm willing to accept as a new fact of my life. I genuinely enjoying literary criticism, and continue to do it with the media I watch, though I haven‚Äôt watched any movies or tv shows in months now, also because of the time thing.

"Books you think could have a sequel ? I‚Äôve been thinking about The Secret History but I‚Äôm a little conflicted.¬†

Don't want to give spoilers, so I‚Äôll try and keep this brief.

Reading the book honestly felt like a lucid dream. It was emotionally.... stimulating, and I definitely had a book hangover after finishing it.

On one hand, I recognise that the book was written in the style of a Greek tragedy, leaving the characters with broken lives and unresolved emotions‚Äîguilt and trauma.

But then at the same time, I wonder if there is a potential for a redemption or reflection arc, similar to Crime and Punishment.¬†

  
The ending left a lot of questions unanswered and I‚Äôm torn between whether that‚Äôs what made the book so impactful‚Äîleaving me thinking about it long after finishing‚Äîor whether I want more closure.

That being said, I would love a sequel from Julian‚Äôs perspective‚Äîa classic narcissist, if I‚Äôm not wrong.",normal

"Religious Themes in Shogun - Pachinko  I read Pachinko about a month ago and was bothered by the virtual signaling, the scripture quoting and the shifts to erotica from time to time. The whole wives being submissive to their husbands and yadda. I almost gave up reading the book because I was so bothered by it. It wasn‚Äôt subtle at all. My sister was reading along with me so I finished the book so we could have our discussion. Now I recently started Shogun after hearing great things about the show. I want to watch it but book first so I can compare, ne? I‚Äôm only 10% in I‚Äôm already starting to get Pachinko vibes. They have mentioned the word crucifix about 6-7 times in this little bit of book so far and the characters keep on bringing up religious sayings. Mind you the book is anti catholic so far, which doesn‚Äôt bother me because I was raised catholic and have big issues with their church as a whole. The travelers that just landed in Japan are to be Protestants and in opposition to the Catholic Portuguese priest already in the village. Some scenes also describe the penis of this one white man as being so endowed and the Japanese women giggling about it in appreciation. The guy has already slept with a courtesan and they seem eager to be seen as Christians as if that was better? I‚Äôm usually not bothered by religious themes in a book. I read and loved Life of Pi and recently finished Wolf Hall which talks about Henry the VIII‚Äôs push for separating himself from the Catholic Church in order to get his marriage annulled. I don‚Äôt mind reading about people having faith but I draw the line when it comes in the shape of scripture quoting and virtue signaling. 
My question is: is Shogun similar to Pachinko in this sense? Catholics bad, Protestants good, praise the lord, mixed in with some gratuitous erotica? I don‚Äôt want to spend all these hours reading just to be upset at every turn of the wheel. ",normal

"Anyone else read The Undercurrent by Sarah Sawyer yet? Just finished it this morning and enjoyed a lot. It was much slower than I expected. The prose was pretty dense and wasn‚Äôt as much a fast read as some thrillers are. I saw it marketed as mystery/thriller but I‚Äôd probably align more as a drama/mystery. Sarah Sawyer was much more invested in getting to know the women in the story than keeping a thrilling pace. 

Overall, I thought that was a good approach and I felt like I knew the characters very well by the end of the book. They all felt like people I could and have known in my life. I also liked that the women in the story were shown very completely with both strengths and very apparent flaws. Sawyer painted a pretty rich portrait of how messy and complicated motherhood can be. Curious to know everyone else‚Äôs thoughts. ",normal
"You're halfway through a book you don't hate, but are having a hard time staying invested in. What do you do? I know the frequent (and not bad) advice is to drop books that aren't engaging you, but I feel like it's more nuanced than that, and particularly when you're at or beyond the halfway point. For example I'm in the middle of a book I bought and paid for (used, but still). I don't hate it by any means, but whenever I pick it up on a lunch break at work or during downtime at home, I only manage a few pages before my mind wanders and I set it down again.

Do other people just drop the book at this point? Dedicate an afternoon and plow through it? Skim pages until it's either interesting or it's over? This one's relatively short, but the longer the book the more difficult the dilemma in my experience.

Edit: For the curious, the book I'm having this dilemma with is [Ice, by Anna Kavan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/636223.Ice). I was excited to start it, but...well, you've read the rest of this post lol",normal

"Spotify Audiobooks So I was looking through some of my apps that I need to delete and I noticed I still had Spotify on my phone, but before I deleted it, I opened it to see if anything changed and something did change. Spotify offers listeners audiobooks. 

As enticing as this sounds, I had to see what the catch was. I looked it up and it absolutely says you can listen to audiobooks on Spotify, but it‚Äôs only 15 hours per month on their premium service. 

15 hours isn‚Äôt anything right? Maybe one or two books? But I‚Äôve read 6 books between September and now. This can‚Äôt be a viable option for people who want to immerse themselves in reading. Or maybe it‚Äôs for those who read one or two audiobooks (separate from their normal reading)

I just thought it was ridiculous that they offer that but that‚Äôs not anything. I guess for casual reading it is fine but I could not do this unless I was like on vacation or something. 

Let me know what you think and if this is something you would be interested in. I personally just have audible and buy any others I need. Maybe that‚Äôs just as bad. ",normal

"Short stories by H.H. Munro (Saki) **Brilliant short stories from a master!**  
  
I recently decided to stretch my literary horizons by exploring the short story genre, so I began by looking up some lists of classics of the genre. The obvious candidates included well-known favourites from big names like Edgar Allan Poe, Guy de Maupassant, H.G. Wells, Oscar Wilde, O. Henry, Rudyard Kipling, Anton Chekhov, and more.   But there was one name I had not come across before, and I found myself delighted with the short stories I subsequently discovered.  That author is Hector Hugh Munro (1870-1916), who wrote under the pseudonym Saki.    
  
Saki was a British writer who proved himself a master of the short story genre, and whose work is rightly compared favourably alongside O. Henry, another of my favourite short story authors.  He was in part inspired by writers like Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll, and Rudyard Kipling, and in turn influenced others such as P.G. Wodehouse.  Many reviewers make frequent comparisons between Saki, Wilde, and Wodehouse.  
  
Typical of Saki's short stories is a biting satire of the stuffy Edwardian emphasis on etiquette and appearances, which was often given priority above morality.  Animals and children frequently outwit adults, and are used to expose the Edwardian hypocrisy that lurked beneath the outward layers of respectability.  His vocabulary is expansive, and his writing is crisp and stylish.  

Many of Saki's stories have comic elements, and returning buffoon characters like Reginald and Clovis are often used as tools to create points of humour, and to provide witty dialogue and mischief.  Some stories also feature an ironic twist at the end, reminiscent of O. Henry.  Saki accomplishes all this with a real economy of words, because it's rare for one of his stories to stretch beyond 2000 words, and most can easily be read in under 10 minutes.    
  
Saki's short stories can easily be found online on a number of websites, so you don't need to buy a book to check out his work.  Of all the Saki stories I've read so far, these are my personal favourites that I highly recommend: Bertie's Christmas Eve, Clovis on Parental Responsibilities, Cousin Teresa, Esme, Laura, Mrs Packletide's Tiger, Sredni Vashtar, The Baker's Dozen, The Boar Pig, The Feast of Nemesis, The Feast of Nemesis, The Interlopers, The Lumber Room, The Mouse, The Open Window, The Reticence of Lady Anne, The Schartz-Metterklume Method, The Seven Cream Jugs, The Stalled Ox, The Unrest-Cure, The Way to the Dairy, and Tobermory.  Brilliant all round!",normal
"The Wife Between Us Maybe I‚Äôve read too many mysteries, but in one word this book was: Trite. 

The book was marketed as some of sensational thriller with an unexpected plot twist that will make your jaw drop. Yet, the plot was an overused and trite story of a woman who married the perfect guy but he turns out to be an abusive monster. 

Majority of the book was the narrator harping on about how she misunderstood her husband and how terribly sorry she was for making that mistake. 

The two ‚Äúmajor‚Äù twists were not that big of a deal. Vanessa is Nellie and Emma is Maggie‚Äôs sister. Done. 

PS - In case anyone wants to ever pick up a Freida McFadden book called the Housemaid, just pick this one up. It looks like the Housemaid was a copy of two books this one, and Behind closed doors. ",normal

"A Heart That Works by Rob Delaney ‚Äî Stunning. This is one of those books that like one chapter in I was already excited to talk about it and knew I'd have a lot to say.

I've read Rob Delaney's other book and I certainly don't remember him being such an incredible writer. It did always make me have a soft spot for him, but this one made me truly adore him. What a wonderful man. I know the book is written from his perspective so I'm sure that's part of it, but then I also feel that he really does display his flaws and I love him for it anyway, probably even more than if he hadn't.

It's hard to put into words what made this so striking. Something about the way he wrote about his grief is so raw. I was at the gym a few days ago trying to decide on what book I wanted to listen to next, and suddenly had a strong desire to start this one which I'd only vaguely considered before. I've struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life and it was a hard day. I've been trying to read comforting books but nothing felt like it helped to distract me at all. So I suddenly needed this one. And it was in fact needed.

This is a story about his son Henry's death and his family's grief. It's not the first book I've read about grief at all, but is by far the most staggering. The first chapter hit me in the heart immediately. His visceral descriptions of the pain and horror. I have no children and I can't relate to his experience, which is a part of why I wanted this story. Now I know. I think it's important to understand things that you haven't been through, to have that compassion. 

There's so many fascinating thoughts Rob has in this. I just completely got it. I think we are kindred spirits. I also feel peace when I hear about other people's pain, because then I know I'm not alone. I also have thoughts and opinions surrounding death that he's had. I felt seen by a lot of what he said.

To me this book was a balm for the soul. Especially when so many horrible things are happening in the world, and the election is coming up and I just feel powerless and sometimes hopeless. There was a lot of gratitude here for the everyday people who made Henry's life better. It really reminded me of how much kindness is in the world. Also the relationship with him and his wife, and how much love they have for each other and their children. That was all life affirming. I honestly recommend it if you're struggling right now.

The very last paragraphs in the book were also just perfection. I absolutely agree with his views and it's something I've been coming to terms with as well.

>*I suspect I am a glass of water, and when I die, the contents of my glass will be poured into the same vast ocean that Henry's glass was poured into, and we will mingle together forever. We won't know who's who. And you'll get poured in there one day too.*

P.S. I remember a lot of people being put off by the ending of Catastrophe, then me reading about how his grief influenced it. I never felt any particular way about that finale anyway (except that it was slightly disturbing) but now I really understand and appreciate it. >!If you don't remember or didn't see the series, the two leads swim into a riptide in the ocean and you as a viewer never really know if they'll be okay or not.!<",normal
"Bi/Multi-lingual readers: any interest in reading a book in one language over another? If so, why? Apologies if this question is too general for this thread. 

What might cause you to choose to read (or re-read) a book in a second or third language?

As someone who wasn‚Äôt raised in a two-language household, I read some books in German (B2/C1) for the challenge/maintenance of language and expansion of vocab. However, I *choose* these books depending on their subject matter and the author‚Äôs writing style.

"Thoughts on the marketing of Nick Harkaway's ""Karla's Choice"" as a John LeCarr√© novel? As a longtime fan of John LeCarr√© I was saddened by the loss of the author, who kept turning out great books right up until the end of his life. I was intrigued to see that his son, Nick Harkaway, would be continuing some of his stories and characters, however I note that this idea has met with fairly mixed reviews among fans.

Personally I am not opposed to the idea, I've read one of Nick Harkaway's books (The Gone-Away World) and enjoyed it, but it was also a completely different genre and style than LeCarr√©, it was a wild and weird post-apocalyptic adventure story. so it will be interesting to see how he adapts to his father's much more subtle and suspenseful approach to writing. There's also the fact that LeCarr√© himself drew from his own substantial real experience and connections in espionage while Harkaway, as far as I know, does not have that background. But I'm still planning to buy the book and give it a fair shot.

That said I think putting the phrase ""A John LeCarr√© novel"" on the book cover is not a great move by the publisher. I don't think it's outright illegal or anything, clearly there's precedent with the many posthumous ""Tom Clancy novels"", but it still rubs me the wrong way, like they are turning him into a brand, it's just kind of gross to me.",normal

Certain books hold special memories for us- maybe because of nostalgia since they take us back to much simpler periods in our lives and some because they helped us evolve or encouraged us to think from the other perspective.

Some of them for me are:

* Harry Potter- Had so many life lessons without being preachy for a middle schooler- courage, loyalty, friendship, etc.
* A Thousand Splendid Suns- Cried so much in this book. Saw the toll that wars takes on Women's Rights and Freedoms. Was so beautiful to read about the transformation of the women's feelings from being wary and hostile to becoming best of confidantes.
* Secret Seven/ Famous Five- Pure childhood nostalgia. Loved the description of the picnics and food and adventures lol
* Pride and Prejudice/ Wuthering Heights- Self explanatory. What wouldn't I do to be able to experience the feelings for the first time again that Mr. Darcy and Heathcliff evoked in the teenaged me.
* Gone with the Wind- I am struck by my evolving perspective of Scarlett every time I read this book, depending on my phase in life.

"On the road to glory: Robert A Heinlein's ""Glory Road"". So it's been a while since I've read anything by Robert Heinlein. But tonight I have read and finished another one of his novels, 1963's ""Glory Road"".

In this one we follow Gordon, who had done a tour of combat in Southeast Asia, who one day finds an ad in the personal section of a newspaper. An ad that asks ""ARE YOU A COWARD?"", and states the requirements that lists for whatever job is at hand. And of course Gordon answers it and goes to the address listed on it.

When he arrives he meets a beautiful woman he has ever met. But this woman has many names, and she takes Gordon on the most fantastic adventure that he has ever experienced before! Through different worlds and many perils, before and after!

This is what a lot people claim to be Heinlein's true fantasy novel. Though for me, I think it fits with the science-fantasy mold, which kind of fits a bit better. This ones pretty good also. It's funny, fast paced and incredibly entertaining. And with the touch that only Heinlein could give it!

I can easily believe this to be a satire on the epic fantasy genre, the kind of fantasy made famous by writers like Tolkien and E.R. Burroughs. One that is a bit tougher and grittier, but is really loads of fun to read! This book is going on the list of the most fun and entertaining books I've ever read, period! Got another of Heinlein's novels that is waiting to be read, but I'll get to that one later as I've got another book by an author from the golden age of science fiction that I haven't read yet.",normal
"Thoughts after finishing ""As I Lay Dying"" I'm usually a scifi fantasy guy. I like wizards and aliens and shit. Unfortunately, my partner has read a lot of my suggestions and cashed in her credit to make me read Faulkner. There are worse fates. Here are my thoughts, which are as disjointed as the narration:

Everyone in this family sucks. Everyone in this family suuuuuuucks. The only exception is Vardaman, who is too young to suck.

In the beginning, as mom Addie is dying, dad Anse insists on sending half the kids off on an errand to earn three dollars. He repeats this a lot. (Actually, every character repeats everything a lot. I can't tell if this is because they're infuriating or because that's how people talked a hundred years ago.) I thought: ""Well, they're simple rural farming types, and it's probably a big deal to them to earn the modern equivalent of like $300."" There is a lot of grumbling from people in and out of the family about trading $3 for the ability to be present while a family member dies, but hey, it's not my place to judge. Then after a while I decided to plug $3 in 1928 dollars into an inflation calculator and *holy shit it's only $55 in 2024*. That's it. Man, there's poverty and then there's greed and idiocy.

Every time a character insulted Anse, to his face or not, was very satisfying to me.

It's fascinating how much interiority and emotional depth the children had given how awful both their parents are.

Seeing how language changes over time was super interesting (cows ""low"", not ""moo""; they'd say ""you bring me that"" whereas we'd say ""bring me that""; countless other little things). Even more interesting was seeing all kinds of things that didn't change, that I'd have expected to be more modern.

I'm not an English major but I suspect this was the first or at least a major early influential example of multiple narrators, which clearly casts a very, very long shadow on modern lit. Cool to see.

I tackled this book by reading the sparknotes chapter summary before each chapter. This cost me some tiny window of spoilers, but it didn't bother me here, because the alternative was not understanding major events at all. The writing isn't shakespearean-level difficult, but a lot of seriously important plot points are written so obtusely that I couldn't notice them even while watching for them after the summary. I highly recommend this strategy for anyone who wants to engage with this or similar works without struggling so much it becomes unfun.

Also, there were neither wizards nor aliens by the time I finished, which was very disappointing.

"The People in the Trees & Hanya Yanagihara  Just finished *The People in the Trees* by Hanya Yanagihara. Man, what an explosive debut! The idea itself, of immortality gained through a turtle, would be interesting on its own. But combined with themes of imperialism, sexual assault, and exploitation, it became this read I couldn‚Äôt put down. Although the writing is first-book material, the rhythm of the prose and the pacing more than made up for it.

	On the sexual assault front, there was plenty of inspiration drawn from Lolita with the frame narrative of his arrest and the autobiographical nature of his account. You begin to doubt him more and more after he returns to the States, and the lack of guilt becomes more and more apparent. I saw the inclusion of SA present in the entire book as an analog to imperialism as it is exploitation of an innocent victim purely for the gain of the perpetrator. It did seem somewhat gratuitous at times, although nowhere near the levels of A Little Life.¬†

	Connecting the two books is apples to oranges, as Trees is certainly more of a plotted adventure, with a distinct A to B plotline. I found Trees to be far better on almost every front; I even wished that it had the length of A Little Life. The nature of his parenting being the clearest candidate for more detail, and perhaps to weave more of his exploits better together. Though the book was dark and graphic at points, Yanagihara put more weight into *WHY* they happened as opposed to what is happening. However, I would not recommend this to a sensitive reader.¬†

	The racial dynamics in the subtext were interesting as well. Nearly every relationship is defined by a power struggle, from Norton‚Äôs with his brother to the nature of lab work and funding. I think that in general, the book takes more of a status quo view, seeing as the narrator is a white male in the mid-20th century and free to pursue whatever pleases him. There‚Äôs certainly a lot of envy towards others, projections placed by Norton onto seemingly everyone besides those he wishes he could be.¬†

	Overall, I greatly enjoyed this book, and honestly wish that it received the same attention as A Little Life. It‚Äôs done in far greater taste, crossing the boundary without necessarily being offensive. What does everyone else think, especially when compared to A Little Life?

"Why is it so hard to find a sci-fi novel about ... well sci-fi?

If feel like it could be a contemporary story.  It doesn't feel like sci-fi.  Several other ones have tried feel the same way.  I think they want to build a world and make it gritty but I want sci-fi.  
Another great example is Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Mars trilogy"".  It is good but feels heavily political and philosophical rather than sci-fi.

"Super disappointed in ‚ÄúThe First to Die at the End‚Äù I went in blind for ‚ÄúThey both die at the end‚Äù having been put off by the title for so long but I was SO blown away that when I came across a copy of the prequel, I immediately dove into it. Unfortunately it suffers from Second Book Syndrome where you can feel the author struggling to replicate the first book and falling short. It feels forced and is way too long, like they were trying so hard to make the reader connect to the story and completely feel the significance of everything. I have other complaints but don‚Äôt want to cross into spoiler territory. One of my favourite books in the world is the first Aristotle and Dante, and the sequel to that also suffered from Second Boom Syndrome but it still held itself together whereas this one kind of fell apart.

"how to read faster‚Äã?
 Hey guys, any tips on how to read faster‚Äã?

I would love to get to the point where I read one book a day, but right now best I can do is 3/week and even then I have to heavily rely on audiobooks.

Do you guys have any tips or techniques you could share with me? I run a business so time I have is very limited + my brain is frequently foggy from social media scrolling.

"Book Covers - Rant In my extensive experience, you should almost always judge a book by its cover. If I saw a book with a gruesome, gory cover, I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to be a sweet fluffy romance. When I see a cover with swords and dragons, I don‚Äôt expect contemporary fiction set in urban New York. Why do people even think that way? 

I almost never read dark romances except when they delve into more psychological sides of romance like inferiority complexes and other conditions. The last one I picked up had a ‚Äòdark‚Äô cover. The posture of the models and the design implied a power imbalance and maybe some partner worship. I went to the reviews and readers were bashing the main characters for their toxicity. They were meant to be toxic; the whole premise of the book was that they were toxic for each other but couldn‚Äôt leave, making more sacrifices for each other. 

Anyway, these are my thoughts. Thanks for listening.",normal
"Have you ever been pleasantly surprised by a ""guest room book""? I was thinking about the books I've come across in guest rooms over the years (at rental properties, an out-of-town friend's place, etc.). Not books I was planning to read, but that I found myself enjoying.

Here are my most memorable:

""The Good Earth"" by Pearl S. Buck - A classic that I'd certainly heard of but never read before. I found a battered copy on a bookshelf in the common area at a B and B. Spent all day glued to it when a storm blew in. Fantastic!

""Dissolution"", ""Dark Fire"" and ""Sovereign"" (first three books of The Shardlake Series) by C.J. Sansom.  I was at a rental property with a loft stacked to the rafters with books (!). Found this series (Tudor England/mystery) and devoured three in a row (they're not short).

""Memoires d'un Tricheur"" by Sacha Guitry. I found this while staying at a hotel in Paris and read it (very, very slowly) in the original French. The more I read, the more my rusty French came back to me which was very satisfying - and it was a good book! 

What strikes me is how much I enjoyed each of these books - despite the fact that I hadn't planned on reading them, in some cases hadn't even heard of them, and they weren't necessarily the sort of thing I'd choose.  It makes me wonder how much of that enjoyment is due to the vacation factor... On the other hand, maybe there was something about being forced out of my usual reading comfort zone that was a good thing...?

I'd like to know: has anyone else come across a ""guest room read"" or two that surprised you?",normal
"Annotating books? So for the last year I have annotated every book I read. Even stuff that‚Äôs not academic I read mostly fantasy and sci-fi. But I find it helps keep me focused being ADHD. I can connect things better and connect to the story and characters more

"In-store techniques for figuring out if a book is good in <5 minutes? My natural inclination is to buy every single book that catches my eye. However when my funds or bookshelf footage is running low I try to be more discriminating in what I buy. When I'm in the bookstore I've developed a technique for evaluating books whose reputation I don't know.

In order:

1. Check the index (if it has one), skim for terms/people I'm familiar with interested in and jump to the page. Read a few paragraphs on that topic.
2. Check the ToC(if it has one), see if the chapter names stoke the same excitement that the title did when it got me to pick it up.
3. Pick a chapter and read a page or two.

I make my judgment off of that. What exactly I'm looking for in the words depends on the sort of book (and has changed over the years), but here are a few things that jump out to me these days.

1. In fiction: Descriptions of people's manners that are so vivid and on-point that they highlight the author's understanding of how people are.
2. In non-fiction concise, explicit, concrete points being made. (Recently reading Sense of Beauty by Santayana on the strength of this.)
3. Lots more semi-tangibles.

I would Like to ask If anyone of you read Millionaire series from Kimberly Loth? What are your thoughts? I am on a fifth book and the more I read the more I am starting to think that AI wrote those books... Especially when I am seeing so many reels as advertisement and there are mistakes, Like person who made them didnt even read that book ü§∑ I also read one post on reddit how there are some pretty serious trauma events in book 1 and in the book they are basically written Like ""ah, life happens"" Like it is not really that a big deal... And that made me think about it even more. 
I am not saying that the books are not good, it just making me wonder ü§î

"Foreshadowing: Subjective Thoughts Some authors I find entertaining make good use of foreshadowing.  Steven King comes to mind with the memorable ""Death, but not for you, Gunslinger"" (Dark Tower series, more than once, and more than one death) comes to mind. 

Terry Pratchett, too, but in a different way.  Prachett leave unresolved questions, such as ""Vetenari wouldn't live forever, or perhaps he will use his vampire connection?"", ""What will Little Sam become?"", and ""What happens if Carrot and Angua have children?"".  Pratchett's foreshadowing, if you can call it that, is in hinted questions that may be resolved in future novels (as, for example was the question of the Low King's gender), but sadly will remain unresolved because Sir Terry died young.

I suspect both authors were leaving space for themselves to write into, if that makes sense, and the foreshadowing leaves space for imagination.  

Brutal use of foreshadowing, as common in thrillers, generally irritates me.  It may create dread, which is unpleasant, or may feel manipulative. 

I'm curious to hear how others feel about foreshadowing, and especially, who they feel uses it well and why",normal
"A continuation of the book from another author. Do you know those cases when the sequel to a book comes out in a strange way? 
The same thing happened with the Russian book 'food department'. The book came out in 2019, and already in 2021 there was a series consisting of 8 episodes. 
In short, this is a thriller book about a pioneer camp where some pioneers become vampires and the main character tries to survive the shift there. The vampires there are not quite ordinary, but it was interesting to read. The book has an open ending and at the end of the first season too. The series was quite successful, not a hit, but the atmosphere of summer and pioneer camp, coupled with sometimes unusual twists, was really cool. Yes, and the hidden subtext and the topics raised were unusual.
 I only read the book before this summer, but I watched the series this summer. The second season came out and if I have no problems with this, like everyone earns as they can, then the second book came out next. The first part was written by Alexey Ivanov, the second is being written by another author. It doesn't fit in my head.

"Americanah : Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie  I just finished reading the book, but unfortunately, it didn't resonate with me.

The language is lucid and easy to read, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The first 150 pages are engaging, particularly the vivid descriptions of everyday life in Nigeria, which paint a clear picture of the place and its people. The outsider's perspective on the USA is equally insightful.

However, I felt that the characters lack depth, seeming flat and one-dimensional. The story becomes stretched and loses momentum.After her return, I expected emotional development, but it didn't materialize.

"Dean Koontz - Midnight I‚Äôve read (and enjoyed) several Dean Koontz books. The one I currently have is Midnight, and I‚Äôm up to chapter 18 and it seems like this is going to be creature horror of the werewolf variety. 

I despise created horror; it‚Äôs not my cup of tea. Is this whole book going to be werewolf nonsense, or does it evolve to other things if I keep reading? I‚Äôd appreciate any feedback other readers have about whether this is worth pursuing. I‚Äôm just not into creature horror (not only werewolves, but vampires for example) It does nothing for me. 

If it‚Äôs going to stick with werewolves, I‚Äôll skip this one! ",normal
"The Splendid and the Vile : Churchill, Family and Defiance During the Bombing of London Just finished reading this. Penning my thoughts here. Would love to hear from others who read this or similar books.

The book primarily delves into Churchill's tumultuous early days as Prime Minister of Great Britain during World War II, offering an intimate look into life at 10 Downing Street during the Blitz. Initially, he was very unpopular amongst key political figures in Britain, and many worried that Churchill's chaotic style might not be suited to leading the country through the looming war. Drawing mainly from diary entries from Mary, Churchill's youngest daughter, John Colville, his secretary, Germany's information minister, Goebbel, and other diarists from the Mass Observation movement, the author narrates in a very engaging yet poetic fashion the ongoings of Number 10 Downing Street during the bombing of Great Britain, especially London. It's a fascinating insight into Churchill's amusing quirks like dictating to his secretary whilst lying in a bath tub and personal habits of mandatory naps,  as well as the lives of his so-called inner-circle, who witnessed his behind the scenes strategizing and emotional turmoil whilst the country was being bombed to shreds. The book doesn't narrate the entirety of the war, but paints beautifully the picture of Britain's courage and resilience during the bombing, which is largely credited to one person, Winston Churchill. His larger-than-life personality, attitude, and ability to rally the nation in such trying times are portrayed poignantly. The book also highlights how Churchill‚Äôs emotionally charged speeches and interaction with commoners eradicated despondency amongst people and ignited resilience and desire for retribution instead. It was also heart warming to read about Churchill's relationship and interaction with Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins, where seeing Britain's suffering, Roosevelt wanted desperately to help Britain yet he had to keep the well being of his nation as well as the upcoming presidential election in mind. I especially liked all the bits about the various letters and notes all the characters wrote each other. It lent a significant  weight to the narration and gave me goosebumps at multiple points. Overall, this book masterfully balances historical detail with personal narrative, providing a vivid portrayal of Churchill and his inner circle in one of Britain‚Äôs darkest hours.

"How to start reading books in your 2nd language? For context I am horribly incompetent at it. I can barely get by reading short texts inclusive of some abbreviations or text slang. It is all informal. I have never studied it in school. I speak it brokenly. sometimes can't keep up with conversations OR use a horribly wrong word that changes the meaning/tone because my vocabulary is too basic.

I struggle to read the embassy webpage or do the mandatory immigration list you get on planes when travelling. 

Soooo should I go for a book that I actually like and have already read? So at least I know what is going on. Was thinking Crime and Punishment. Or do I go for a book that I've never read in English before?

"Toni Morrison I just finished *Beloved*, the first novel by Morrison that I‚Äôve ever read. It took just a couple of days. And WOW! It was mystical, horrifying, and incredibly sad‚Äîand worth every second. The format confused me a little at times, but I believe I picked up on most of its meaning.
 
Despite them living lives that are obviously very different from my own, I felt I could understand each character and why they felt or acted in the way they did. Sethe (is it pronounced Seth?) was my favorite. Stamp Paid, too.

It‚Äôs the kind of book you need to be prepared for, at least if you‚Äôre sensitive to topics of racial injustice, sexual assault, and death. There were several times I felt so disgusted and uncomfortable that I had to take a pause. But I don‚Äôt think I could have stopped reading completely, even if I tried. 

It‚Äôs great reading by yourself but I think this is the kind of book that would also benefit from group discussion. That‚Äôs probably why many schools include it in their curriculum.

"30 Page Prologue I didn't expect the prologue in my current read to be 30 pages long. The last book that I read that had a prologue was 4 and a quarter pages long. I have never had a book prologue be that long before that was like a whole chapter. I get that the characters have a childhood past together but I feel like the author could have picked one event of the childhood for the prologue and then have the characters have flashbacks throughout the book. The prologue is suppose to be a quick thing that gets you into the book and hooked at least in my opinion. I found myself going stir crazy reading and kept asking myself is it done yet? It added some information for the reader but I feel like a lot of it could have been taken out and have the characters bring it up farther in the book or just not do a prologue. 

What is the longest prologue you have read? Do you like them or not a fan? Should there be a limit on how long a prologue is?",normal
"Inner monsters: Edward Levy's ""The Beast Within"". Completed a short but interesting novel tonight by an unknown author by the name of Edward Levy, and it is titled ""The Beast Within"".

So here the story is set in the Ozark Mountain region in the Northwest area of Northwest Arkansas, it starts off with an act of cheating between the wife of a very brutal husband and a salesman, leading to the husband enacting a horrific instance of revenge that ends with the salesman being imprisoned in the cellar for twenty years. And during those years the not-so-innocent salesman becomes increasingly insane and turns into something that is less than human.

Soon he breaks loose and in the process would come to cross pass with a newly married couple and irrevocably change their lives, and leave a legacy that would haunt them.

This is a short book but the contents of it are extremely dark and extremely brutal. I mean there are some pretty gruesome moments in it along with some very spicy moments too. And all done in a very surprising literary way even. That is most likely because of the research that Levy did while he worked on it, which included lycanthropy, parapsychology, animal telepathy (interestingly enough) and Ozark mountain folklore.

And since I mentioned lycanthropy here, yes this is Levy's own take of the werewolf trope in horror. I think I would put this novel in the psychological horror category with a bit of a supernatural twist. Some of the characters that initially appear in the story, especially in the first part of it, aren't particularly that sympathetic, but the young family, the MacCleary's, I really feel for, especially in regards with what is happening to their only son. This is a particularly short but very sharp novel, done in a very literary way. And it of course only one of two novels, that I know of, that Levy had written. The other, ""Came A Spider"" I might have to track down.

Oh,and as a side note, I do live in the Northwest region of Arkansas in the Ozarks, and I kind of wonder what folktales, particularly in the Ozarks, Levy used as one of the key basics for this novel?",normal
"I love buying used books Just came back from book festival with indie authors, small writers panels and the library bookstore selling their wares. I bought a couple of books that I've always wanted to have like Dante's inferno and interview with a vampire by Anna Rice. What I live most about going through these used books are the little piece of the previous owner. In Dantes inferno, someone left their study notes typed on an electric type writer and hand written notes on the side. In a copy of Gai-Jin from James Caldwell, someone left a handwritten recipe for simple pancakes. 

I don't know about you but these little trinkets fill me with a little bit of joy. Especially if they leave a note or their name on the inside of the book. Having the prettiest book is nice but some of these well loved one have their own charm to them.",normal
"What book do you think is a must read but you disagree with in part or as a whole? This might be easier to answer for Non Fiction readers, however I'd love to hear answers of a fiction variety if some do exist. I am currently reading *Amusing Ourselves To Death*  by Neil Postman and while I agree with Postmans big claims, the small mintuae of his argument lose me and I find myself disagreeing with him. 

I also think *Amusing Ourselves* should be read by nearly everyone and is a fascinating look at what TV has done to culture as a whole, even if I don't quite agree. Meaning I'm in the paradox of recommending with a caveat.

"Some thoughts on Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose I just recently read this book and had to share some thoughts about it, to bounce some of my impressions off others who have read it.  
  
For those unfamiliar with it, this debut novel from author Umberto Eco was first published in Italian in 1980, but later became a smash hit around the world in many languages. It's sold over 50 million copies and has received many international awards.  
  
Overtly this book is a murder mystery. It's framed as a story of someone who found a narrative of 14th century events within medieval manuscripts, and despite being entirely fictional, it is presented with real authenticity.  
  
Set over the course of seven days, the basic plot concerns a young Benedictine monk, Adso of Melk, who is conscripted to join the erudite Franciscan monk William of Baskerville as he visits a monastery in northern Italy to witness a theological debate. William is a former inquisitor, and his deductive powers are immediately on display, in a hilarious incident where he divines the whereabouts of a missing horse, in a way that brings to mind Sherlock Holmes at his best. The local abbot asks William to investigate the mysterious death of an illuminator who recently fell from the abbey's library. But from then on, someone at the abbey dies mysteriously daily, apparently following the pattern of apocalyptic judgements found in the book of Revelation.  
  
The key to this mystery appears to lie in a mysterious book (the missing second part of Aristotle's Poetics, in which he discusses laughter) and the labyrinth that holds the abbey's giant collection of books. This library is built like a giant maze and occupies an entire floor of the massive castle that makes up the abbey. As the story progresses, William slowly collects evidence and eventually explores the mysterious labyrinth that is at the heart of the story.  
  
But this is more than just a detective story. It's also seen by many to be an intellectual exploration of what truth is, from theological, philosophical, scholarly, and historical perspectives. Eco himself was a scholar in semiotics, which is the systematic study of sign processes and the communication of meaning. So, it's not surprising that his book has many themes relating to interpretation and meaning, and about the importance of inquiring carefully to determine truth. As he once said, ""Books are not meant to be believed but to be subjected to inquiry. When we consider a book, we mustn't ask ourselves what it says but what it means.""  
  
Many of these themes only emerge in the closing parts of the novel. The character of William represents the importance of rational investigation and logical deduction, which contrasts the dogmatic censorship of some of the other characters, who are determined to keep the secrets of the library closed and hidden. We're encouraged to sympathize with William's approach and to criticize that of his detractors.  
  
Yet there's something ironic about the closing part of the novel. William concedes in the end that while it looked like everything was planned, much of what happened was a result of coincidence and error. It's not that readers are left with loose threads that are unexplained; rather, the chain of events turns out to be more a result of chance than of human decisions. Eco himself says about the novel's conclusion that ""very little is discovered and the detective is defeated."" For this reason, the book is sometimes considered a work of postmodernism.  
  
Certainly, Eco's own remarks about the significance of the novel would appear to support that. The edition I read had a lengthy postscript from the author, with some of his own commentary about the book. He wants each reader to come with their own interpretation, and deliberately doesn't want to interpret things for us. In his view, ""the author should die once he has finished writing, so as not to trouble the path of the text."" But as much as he insists on refusing to give an interpretation of his book, it seems clear that he is making a case for postmodernism, and where the series of deaths in the story are ultimately just a chaotic pattern of multiple causes and accidents, and without real meaning, thus suggesting that the quest for certainty and meaning is often fruitless. Even the chosen title ""The Name of the Rose"" was deliberately chosen to be something neutral and empty, rather than a clue to what the novel is about.  
  
The Name of the Rose is not an easy book to read, because it constantly makes frequent allusions to literature, geography, and history, and is very demanding on its reader. There's a dense cast of characters, often with similar names. Many times we're confronted with entire sentences in Latin, without any translation, adding real obscurity. The style often feels scholarly in tone. At times a lengthy paragraph will go on for an entire page, and the reader must wade through lengthy lists that feel more like a catalogued inventory of a ship's cargo than a novel. Eco has been criticized for all this, but he has stated that he deliberately made the first one hundred pages difficult and demanding, despite suggestions he abbreviate this by friends and editors, because he wanted to eliminate any would-be readers unwilling or unable to persevere and thus be unworthy of his book.  
  
The theological debate over Christ's poverty is particularly central to the novel, because the dispute that occupies the monks concerns whether Christ had been poor and whether this is an ongoing mandate for the church; and also whether the pope or the emperor should hold political authority in Europe. The abbey was chosen as a neutral location, with repetitive from both sides.  
  
I did appreciate the academic and theological flavour of the novel, particularly the account of some of the rhetoric about apostolic poverty (p340ff), which has a historical basis in real debates from the 14th century, and revolved around whether Christians could rightly hold any property. Unsurprisingly this theology appealed to the impoverished masses of the time and threatened the wealth and land ownership of the church. it was condemned as heretical by Pope John XXII in 1323, although the Spiritual Franciscans continued to live by that doctrine. I found this background of these theological disputes stimulating and fascinating.  
  
Despite the theological subject matter, and a setting populated with clergymen, the novel does still venture into some dark moral territory. One of the sub-plots concerns the same-sex passions of a monk in a sexual relationship with another monk. Even Adso himself ends up having a sexual fling with one of the local girls. To be fair, all this is described in a very sober, poetic, and even intellectual way (p.245), so rather than having the feel of a saucy romance novel, it recalls passages of Song of Solomon and similar texts. So even carnal acts are presented in a detached way, and closely connected with spiritual struggles of the soul, and they feel more like poetic and theological observations about virtues and vices than pure smut.  
  
Despite the promise and potential, I still found myself feeling somewhat disappointed by the time the novel wrapped up. There is some excitement in the closing part, including a showdown with the main villain, and a massive fire. And when we discover how all the events unfolded everything does make sense. But is it simply divine justice orchestrating events, as the story's villain believes? Or have multiple causes and accidental happenings contributed to the chain of events more than anything else, as Eco wants us to believe? As a result, there's a sense of postmodern ambivalence and ambiguity about the ending, despite there being no loose ends. Furthermore, even the narrative of final events didn't feel that suspenseful or exciting on a surface level.  
  
The Name of the Rose has turned out to become a surprising bestseller, and a modern classic. It's just a pity that despite its success, it doesn't quite live up to what I was hoping for in the end, and I expected more of a pay-off. But perhaps that says more about my sentiments about post-modernism than it does about this book.",normal

"Has reading any book ever scared or disturbed you as much as watching movie?  Got into a debate with this guy about how books can be as scary, disturbing, and upsetting as movies. I mean that's my position. He said no, the medium of film is much more immediate. Like you get the visual and the sound together, and more importantly you can't just stop the way you can stop reading a book, which is a more intentional and active activity.

He used the example of the movie Psycho and also Requiem for a Dream, saying a book could never be as intense because authors can't do visual tricks and use music the way those movies do.

I've been reading ""The Last Mrs. Parrish"", by Liv Constantine, and besides Jackson having money, I just can't see what the main character finds so fascinating about him. He's bland, he's boring, his character is almost nothing but a ""rich male"" stereotype. He seems - to me, anyway - to have absolutely zero personality. 

Is he just not my ""type""? Am I missing something? Or maybe he is SUPPOSED to be dull, to add question to the main character's obsession with him? I just don't understand it. ",normal
"What happened to ""The House of the Scorpion"" by Nancy Farmer? I did not read it as a kid, but I read it a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it.  The concept of a boy who's really the clone of a drug lord and is supposedly raised to eventually inherit said drug lord's empire.  I found the story compelling, the characters well developed, the themes of cloning and the search for personal identity are well represented and explored.  Not to mention the tension, world building, and plot points were well established.  Of course, the sequel ""The Lord of Opium"" leaves a lot to be desired, but ""The House of the Scorpion"" deserves its recognition and accolades (can't miss the 3 medals on the cover).

Why wasn't it more popular?  With a premise like that, why hasn't it already been adapted into a movie or TV series?  It may be considered dystopian, but IMO it's better than Hunger Games, Maze Runner, and Divergent.  There are many more lackluster books and newer books that have been adapted (some hits and misses).  I believe this book deserves its time to shine.  ",normal
"waiting for their next book but remembering that authors have things going on in their lives also I read Circe by Madeline Miller and the Song of the Lioness series by Tamora Pierce (and I intended to explore Tortall a bit more later).  While awaiting their next work, I understand that both of them are going through health problems.  I follow the Youtuber darkmatter2525 and am making my way through his ""Shadow of the Tyrant King"" novel series; my impression of the first book is that it's compelling and unique enough and that I do recommend it.  He had an episodic Youtube series called ""Power Corrupts"" and had intended to make it into a novel series.  However, his home was in the path of Hurricane Milton, and thank goodness he's safe.  He also reports having to care for a special needs son.  I suppose it puts things in perspective that though these authors delivered works we've enjoyed and appreciated that leave us wanting more, their health and personal lives take priority in their eyes, and we should respect that.  

Of course, there are authors like George R.R. Martin...",normal

"Which book/author you had read that turns out to be much more difficult than you expected? Putting aside authors that are quite known to be difficult and often discussed here (Pynchon, Joyce, Faulkner and etc..), which author or book you've picked expecting it to be a casual read but ended up struggling with it?

For me as an ESL reader, I can honestly say there are a lot author I am struggling with even though i have been using english since I was a teenager. So, It's not easy me for to get recommendations because there are always a chance that the writing styles while feel normal to everyone else, end up much harder for me.

There was this novel particularly i want to point out. Somebody recommended the book on a post in a horrorlit subreddit and the premise intigued me. Usually with horror the writing styles are not very hard, but with this book (The Dead Path) made me quit after like 10 pages because it's nearly unreadable to me.

Excerpt from the book posted by a goodreads commenter:

*""Nicholas got inside and twisted the car alive. The bones of a city don't change. Perhaps its skin grows tight or flaccid as suburbs grow fashionable of become declassee; crow's feet spread from pockets--new streets, new arteries into fresh corpulence. But the skeleton of its founding roads, the blood of its river, the skull of the low mountain that looms over it with its thorny crown of television towers like its own blinking Calvary...these things hadn't changed.""*

It's not like I dont understand them at all, I do eventually,  but it caused me to read sentences multiples times and slow down, and its hard to get absorbed into the story.

For me this is the biggest barrier in reading novels because i cannot just choose whatever topic and story I am interested about. Do you guys had the same experience? Which author caught you off guard?

"Elif Shafak - There are Rivers in the Sky  (No spoilers) 

Just finished this and loved it. I think Elif Shafak is fast becoming one of my favourite authors, having also read and loved 10 Minutes 38 Seconds and The Island of Missing Trees.

This is certainly the most epic of the three, and I really enjoyed how it followed three storylines across several centuries. I also enjoyed the very slight hint of magical realism.

10 Minutes and 38 Seconds is probably my favourite of the three I've read as it has a dark humour the others don't have.

"The secret history, some questions. I just finished reading The secret history by Dona Tartt. And i have a lot of thoughts and questions so i thought posting here is a good idea, also i read few reviews and a bit of theories so i am really interested in TSH lore.

1. Did they actually kill the farmer? I feel like they might have not killed him and were wrong about it. Making it more tragic.

2. Also about the ritual and stuff so there is a lot of supernatural things happening, did they actually experience all that stuff during bacchanal? Or they just lied?

3. Was Henry trying to frame Richard and kill Charles? And were his feelings towards camilla genuine or was he just manipulating her?

4. Is Henry a psychopath or just a victim of events? I feel like was definitely manipulative but he didn't want to kill Bunny but there was no choice and farmer's death was an accident.

5. The incest ?? Also i feel like in the end charles might have tried to force himself on Camilla. Idk

6.Is Richard genuine or just an unreliable narrator twisting the story? Also what exactly makes Henry to confide in Richard? 

7. Henry killing himself and making the ultimate sacrifice, do you think he redeems himself in that way?

8. Is Julian actually the master manipulator, orchestrating everything? Maybe a part of some ritual. His behaviour was weird and by the end Richard points out some stuff regarding it.

"To Kill A Mockingbird: please can a USA reader check my (UK teacher) ideas? Hi all and thank you in advance.

I'm a UK teacher prepping TKAM for the first time. I have mixed feelings about the book but at the moment I have to teach it so I just want to do a good job. I would love someone with better background knowledge than me to just give a little feedback on these points. Thank you so much.

1. I'm really interested in poverty in the book as a social ill alongside racism. Is it fair to say that poverty in the South in the Depression was traceable back to the Civil War and Reconstruction as well as the Depression itself? The American Civil War is not widely taught here in the UK and I don't think this is on many teachers' radars, but the fact of Alabama being on the ""losing"" side and the collective memory of the Civil War seem quite relevant to the book.
2. To what extent am I right in thinking this is partly a ""giving voice to the voiceless"" type of book? From the viewpoint of 1960s America it might have been easy for some readers to dismiss a poor, racism-ridden town in Depression Alabama as beneath their worldview. Is it fair to tell students that in fact Lee is trying to crack open this image and present a three-dimensional view of the time and place?
3. One of the themes in the book seems to be that the apparatus of government -- education, the courts -- is faulty and does a poor job of people's actual lives. It isn't equal to the social problems on the ground. Is it fair to say this reflects a deeper mistrust between disadvantaged people and the state?

Would love any comments on these ideas. Thank you!

"What are your thoughts on rebinding antique books that are in poor condition?  There's this antique herbalism book from 1889 that I've been eying up and I managed to find a copy. 
However, it is sadly in poor condition with the spine practically falling apart and some pages loose. 
The pages however look to be in good condition. 

I have the skills, knowledge and tools to rebind it but I'd have to take the entire book apart, resew it and possibly even make a new cover for it. 

I was going to rebind it using some fresh book board or wooden boards and some high quality black leather that I have for such special projects. 

It also looks like it's had a bit of repair before too. 

I know that doing this will devalue the book but because of its poor condition, I think that it will give it a new life. 

How do you all feel about doing such a thing to such an old book?

Would you leave it as is, see if someone can do a full restore bringing it back to original condition or do a full rebind knowing that it won't be as valuable any more?

"Elias Canetti  I bought and read Auto-da-F√© a while ago and became very interested in Canetti's ability to write so I read Crowds and Power, and a selection of some of his writings through out his career called I Want to Keep Smashing Myself Until I am Whole, and then I bought the collection of his memoirs because of that book so I'll be reading that soon.  And to note, a book of his is getting an English translation for the first time very soon so I will obviously be getting that since there were snippets of it in the  selection book.  

Auto-da-F√© was an interesting book, I don't like using that word bur it's the best I can think of to describe it.  At the beginning it reminded me of the movie The Phantom Thread due to the main characters self obsession and narcissism, though as you continue to read you realize that every time we follow a new character we are 100% inside their own head and their own world, which took me a minute to figure out but I stuck along with the ride because the writing itself was what kept me going.  It reminded me of how I first read Notes from the Underground, as if in time that I'm not careful I might end up like the main character.  In short, I am glad that I read it but can understand why some people wouldn't want anything to do with it.  I read on the back of the book it was supposed to represent the current climate for European literature so I thought that the main character was a personified caricature of classic literature terrified of no longer having a place in the ever evolving world.

Crowds and Power was a fascinating read, I'm very surprised, or at least have no idea if, Rene Gerard never mentioned or collaborated with Canetti because they have a lot of similar theories when it comes to people and the crowds that follow them.  It delves deep into reasons the human mind may become to manipulated into giving itself to someone else, through mythologies based of already existing human characteristics, to current systems breaking down its people to exploit their obedience.  So many ideas and ways things can happen.  

I Want to Keep Smashing Myself Until I am Whole as I said is selected writings of his but I think is still a good introduction to him, I haven't read all his works but this book includes some other of his writings in regards to his book that aren't included in those books.  I'll be reading his full memoirs soon.

If anyone else has read his works, I'd love to know what you think?  ",normal

"Wolf in White Van Started and finished this book today, it is a quick read and I was impressed by how engaging it is.  I realize this book is 10 years old now but I'm interested in getting others' thoughts about it.  I checked out the GoodReads reviews which seem to all go along with the assumption that Sean's ""accident"" was >!a failed suicide attempt.!<

>!What Sean did wasn't an accident, but it also wasn't a suicide attempt.  My reading of the book is that he got exactly the outcome he was aiming for.  Here's why:!<

* >!When Sean meets the teenagers in the parking lot, he's asked what the worst part of his disfigurement is.  His answer is not the social isolation, the stares, the inability to eat food normally, but the hearing issue caused by the injury.  The teens are incredulous and ask him if he would rather have a ""more normal"" face or have his hearing fixed, and he says he doesn't know anymore.!<
* >!Sean's total disinterest in having any reconstructive surgery that could give him a normal life.  This might be interpreted as reluctance to have a more experimental procedure done on his face, but I feel like most people in his situation would jump at the chance anyway.!<
* >!He says of his relationship with his father, ""I did something terrible to his son.""  This is a really striking line highlighting, in my view, that Sean killed the boy who was a normal teenager and is now someone else.!<
* >!Similarly, when he is in the hospital, he tells his mother, ""I was going to be lonely anyway.""  At another point in the book, he suggests that he always seems to know exactly how things will play out.!<
* >!Sean hypothesizes that, if things had been different, if he hadn't decided to shoot himself, he might have gotten some mail-order swords and gone on a rampage and become an infamous killer.  Or, equally likely, he might have hung them on his wall and eventually outgrown them.  He imagines telling his mother, ""Do whatever you want with them.  I'm not that person anymore.""!<
* >!He has a perfect moment with Kimmy, kissing her and seeing the beauty of his area, right before he shoots himself.  I interpret this as him realizing that, even in that beautiful moment, he still felt cut off and isolated.!<
* >!Finally, the very last scene of the book.  He pulls the trigger, crying and wondering if that's because he really wants to ""do this"" or really doesn't want to, but it doesn't matter.  The book ends: ""Okay.  There it is.  I am here now.  And then I laid down on my belly and listened to the rising squall beyond my door.""  !<

>!To me, all of this paints a fairly clear picture of Sean's motivations.  After kissing Kimmy, he realized that he would always be a loner, alienated from society and self-isolating.  By mutilating his face in such a dramatic way, he externalizes that alienation.  Nobody questions why he lives by himself and has no romantic partners or friends.  His parents don't pester him to get out of the house more.  He doesn't have to try to go to college, date, get a normal job, or any of other adult things that he knows he will struggle with.  He frees himself from the expectations of being a person that he is not, and becomes his ""true self.""  ""Okay.  There it is.  I am here now.""  !<

>!In his view, the alternatives were to live that life that he wasn't meant for, or to go on a homicidal rampage, and even contemplates killing his parents.  But, in the end, he doesn't want to hurt anyone, as he emphasizes in the letter to Carrie's parents, so he decides to just turn the gun on himself.  Much like the choose your own adventure system of Trace Italian, he chose his own life on his own terms.!<",normal
"Writers or books that paint with words? I enjoy well-done descriptions. I don't mean just bare description, which you might find in nonfiction, maybe in some manuals even, but a kind of poetic or sensual painting with words. So you can almost feel yourself there, watching, listening, touching, even smelling and tasting things.

I'm often in my head, so creative descriptions, whether of nature or people or whatever, really helps ground me in the story and bring it to life for me. 

The kind of writing I like is hard to do right, and some authors who want to sound poetic and deep produce work borders on purple prose, but when it's done right, it's amazing.

For instance, this I think is a good example of what I like. This how The Amber Spyglass by Pullman begins:

""In a valley shaded with rhododendrons, close to the snow line, where a stream milky with meltwater splashed and where doves and linnets flew among the immense pines, lay a cave, half-hidden by the crag above and the stiff heavy leaves that clustered below.""

""The woods were full of sound: the stream between the rocks, the wind among the needles of the pine branches, the chitter of insects and the cries of small arboreal mammals, as well as the birdsong; and from time to time a stronger gust of wind would make one of the branches of a cedar or a fir move against another and groan like a cello.""

""It was a place of brilliant sunlight, never undappled. Shafts of lemon-gold brilliance lanced down to the forest floor between bars and pools of brown-green shade; and the light was never still, never constant, because drifting mist would often float among the treetops, filtering all the sunlight to a pearly sheen and brushing every pine cone with moisture that glistened when the mist lifted. Sometimes the wetness in the clouds condensed into tiny drops half mist and half rain, which floated downward rather than fell, making a soft rustling patter among the millions of needles.""

"Gave Up on Filterworld By Kyle Chayka Halfway Through I was hoping to get all the way through, since I‚Äôd seen Chayka on a couple of music YouTube channels being interviewed, but I found the book much to defeatist about the state of culture to finish. So many of his observations failed to provide any meaningful solutions, and instead felt resigned to just comment on culture elements he felt were detrimental. It felt very pedestrian in a lot of ways, unfortunately.

Maybe the back half had more solutions, but what I read was becoming a chore of wondering what he was going to complain about next.",normal
"Symbolism in ‚ÄúFarewell, My Lovely‚Äù  I‚Äôve been reading some Raymond Chandler lately, and I recently read ‚ÄúFarewell, My Lovely‚Äù. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and recommend it to anyone interested in the noir genre (though saying you recommend Chandler for noire is like saying you recommend Shakespeare for sonnets, or Asimov for high-concept sci-fi. I mean- duh, right?). However, there was a piece of symbolism that I think went right over my head. Most of the way through the book, before Marlowe (the protagonist) goes to confront the lynchpin of the case, he‚Äôs talking to someone at the homicide bureau about the case, and notices a bug with pink spots (hereafter referred to as ‚Äúthe pink bug‚Äù) that struggled to find a way out of the room he was in. Marlowe is sort of focused on the bug throughout the conversation, and closes the talk with his colleague (who he‚Äôs kind of at odds with) by picking up the bug, taking it outside, and putting it in a bush. 

There‚Äôs some juxtaposition a little later on that makes it clear (in my opinion anyway), that the bug is supposed to represent Marlowe‚Äôs own tenacity- a creature in an environment not made for him that constantly beats him down and prevents him from reaching his goal, but he struggles on anyway, because it‚Äôs all he knows how to do. 

My question is this- at the very end of the book, he flashes back to the bug, and wonders if it‚Äôs gone back into town hall by now, and if so, how far along it‚Äôs gotten. Why? The line seems kind of out of the place in the ending, which is largely about his relationship with Anne and the kinds of people they both are, and the bug line seems to come out of nowhere. Does anybody have any insight that might explain why Chandler decided to call back to that theme at that moment? Does the bug represent more- or something entirely different- than I thought? Am I reading too much into what was supposed to be a simple analogy in a pulpy-kind of a book? Any insight is appreciated. ",normal
"I need to talk about ‚Äúwe need to talk about Kevin‚Äù Just finished the book, it was amazing but utterly depressing here are my thoughts:

1. Everyone sucks in this book, Franklin is a naive dumbass who won‚Äôt discipline his child,Eva is an arrogant narcissist who resented her son from the word ‚Äúgo‚Äù, Kevin is a cold blooded murderer and possibly a psychopath.

2. The way Eva treated Cecilia compared to the way she treated Kevin makes me think she have misandrist tendencies, she clearly wanted a daughter and Kevin definitely picked up on that.

3. Kevin wasn‚Äôt properly disciplined, the way he‚Äôs so casual about disrespecting his parents especially his mother, and his casual profanity in front of his sister is unacceptable behavior.  

4. I guessed the ‚Äútwist‚Äù pretty early but it still had me doubting

That‚Äôs this book. I am irate that I read this long-winded torture porn. I think I finished it out of spite, more than anything. 

The first 30% was pretty good! We had the gothic setting, a sapphic romance, an interesting dilemma. I definitely saw the plot twist coming (seriously, who grows up among thieves and would be stupid enough to think Gentleman wouldn‚Äôt pull a fast one?), but I was enjoying it.

"Demonology, by Rick Moody I haven't read anything by this guy before, never heard his name, but there are apparently quite a few posts on this sub about other books by him.  Nothing about this one though.

It's a short story collection.  One of the stories is VERY short.  Two pages.

I would say ""strangely effective"" sums up most of the ones I've read so far.  I haven't finished the book, but I can see that I'm going to, which doesn't happen often with fiction.  His writing is easy to love.  Is all writing at least partly a way of flirting with the reader?  Hmm, saith the Lord.  And it was hmm.

Love is the right word, though.  His writing sticks to you the way meat and potatoes should and never do.  He's good at changing it up, giving you a new perspective, a new ""so THIS is what the story's about"" and then doing it again a few pages later, until you've piled up reasons to think it over like stuffed animals on a bed:  too many, and also never enough.

No insights, fortunately or unfortunately.  But he's not an atmosphericist, like McCarthy, either; his focus is on the relationships between people, not on the critical absurdity of life.  He treats them carefully, too.  He seems to love them all, strange as that may be.  It's a very attractive pose.",normal
"The increasingly detailed categorization in book blurbs feels really cheapening Maybe this is my ""old man yells at clouds"" moment, but is it me or are book descriptions getting more and more itemized? I just came across one that partially reads:

The breakdown of all the tropes to be found in the book really makes me lose a lot of interest in it, to be honest. Maybe it's because it feels like it means a very by-the-numbers narrative that's going to hit all the plot elements that are currently popular? I don't know, it just seems like one of those things that editors love because it enables very precise marketing, but that ultimately dispels a lot of the mystery in picking up a new book or series.

"Memoirs of a Geisha  Hi y'all, I just finished reading Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden and I just wanted to share some of my thoughts, hope that's ok!

First of all, I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was a delightful read and I would recommend it to anyone 16 years or older who is interested in art, history, or beauty, 10/10. 

  
I find it really interesting how Sayuri‚Äôs life could‚Äôve been completely different. If, for example, Hatsumomo had become her older sister and not Mameha, she could have easily become just like her. Just as she molded Pumpkin into something she wasn‚Äôt, Hatsumomo may have molded Sayuri, too. In the end, I didn‚Äôt really like Pumpkin anymore. Hatsumomo made her mean and nasty, which is kind of sad to me. She and Sayuri grew up together, they were friends, and before the end, Sayuri tried to get Pumpkin to remember that. I don‚Äôt really want to blame Pumpkin, though; she had a hard life. With Hatsumomo‚Äôs cruelty, Sayuri replacing her as the Nitta Okiya‚Äôs adopted daughter, and then having to work as a prostitute for two years during the war? That‚Äôs enough to turn anyone a bit sour, I suppose. 

And it kind of makes me wonder, if Sayuri didn‚Äôt have those beautiful blue-gray eyes of hers, how different would her fate have been? Would the chairman have taken notice of her crying at the river and showed her kindness? Would Mameha and Mother or the countless men that she entertained have been so kind, or patient, or generous with our flawed character, without her stunning, one-of-a-kind gaze? 

Also, I had a myriad of mixed emotions when I learned that the chairman had a wife. I mean, come on. You've been obsessing over this dude for over a decade, and he has a wife?! And children?! It just really took some of the wind out of the sails in the whole love story if I'm being honest. But I also found it hilarious and, in a way, perfectly fitting. At one point in the story, Mameha tells Sayuri that women become geisha not because they want to, but because they have no other option. I think this unexpected romantic twist really fits in perfectly with these themes of acceptance and managing expectations that we have going on here. 

Again, I just loved this book. Please feel free to share any of your thoughts with me, as well as recommendations for similar books for my next read. Thank you!

"We're in October so let's talk about Frankenstein First off, I want to say it's so impressive that Mary Shelley, a young girl of 18 or 19 wrote a book this good, with so many layers to it ripe for analysis and interpretation. Show a level of intelligence, skill, and maturity that much older people often lack.

Second, before reading the book, I thought Frankenstein was the name of the monster. Then I read the book and realized Frankenstein was the name...of the monster. :p

Seriously though, I both sympathize with and dislike Frankenstein. Sometimes he is like that innocent and highly intelligent and curious kid doing things he does not realize will have severe consequences. Like scientists who did the basic research that was used as the foundation for creating the atomic bomb. At other times he seems to be so full of himself, like an egotistical, moody, and irresponsible parent. Or, well, a merciless God.

One last observation: I very much appreciated Shelley allowing the creature to tell his own story, something that I feel was not often the case for people back in the 1700s and 1800s, especially for women and children. But she respects the creature enough to allow him to tell his story and I felt that showed great humanity.",normal

"Thomas Harris's ""Hannibal Rising"". And now I have fully completed the Hannibal series by finishing up ""Hannibal Rising""!

Essentially what I read was pretty much Hannibal Lecter's origin story. A story that begins on the Eastern Front during the second world war that provided the main ingredients to create the monster that he would eventually become.

Orphaned and brilliant, but with demons that are hiding inside of his memories, gouging him with the fragments of his horrible past. And if he can find and confront them in his heart and brain, he can find them in the flesh and then hunt them down to achieve a kind of peace.

While on the other hand a beautiful exotic woman takes him into her heart, and she uses every weapon and wile she has at her disposal in order to save him from the darkness, and to keep the horrible forces stemmed that were unleashed by Hannibal.

Some of Hannibal's past life was hinted at in the third book, but here in the fourth, and final, book in the series we get the full story. It is in ""Hannibal Rising"" we have a complete picture of how Lecter ended up being the way he is. Along with all the horror and intrigue there is also this very strong sense of tragedy that goes along with it, especially in some scenes.

In my mind this, and also including ""Hannibal"", is pretty solid book. It isn't in the same level of greatness as ""Red Dragon"" or ""Lamb"", but still very solid. And it is also not as long as ""Hannibal"", but I still got quite a lot out of it. And since it is the last book in the series it is time bid Lecter adieu as soon I will be heading and reading a different book from a different author.",normal
"Richard Power's The Playground I am curious what people's thoughts were about the book.

Personally, I was expecting to like this a lot more. I am an avid scuba diver so I was super excited to see Powers give the ocean the same mystical awe he gave forests in Overstory. I also recognized some of the Polynesian stories having grown up in Hawaii, and was excited to hear about Ina‚Äôs life.

Ultimately, the descriptions of the ocean somewhat fell flat. One of my earliest dive memories was seeing a cuttlefish and although the performance Powers described was on paper everything I experienced and more, it still felt it somehow didn‚Äôt do it justice. I did read that Powers dove when he grew up, but the book didn't read as if it was written by someone who loved diving.

Here are some of my additional thoughts: 

I also wished we could see more of the relationships between the characters>!, especially Ina and Rafi. I felt we mostly got to know them through Todd's story, but Todd is likely the most unreliable narrator in the book. I wanted to see why they fell in love with each other, hear their side of the (seemly quite significant) relationship they each had Todd, and then also know how the conflict unfolded in their eyes. Given that Ina gets all the money in the end, getting to know a bit more about what drives her would have made the ending feel more closed. I also wish we could have seen a bit into Evelyn's life after Limpet died since that seemed like a very transformational moment for her.!<

I am also curious what people thought of the end. >!It felt a bit like whiplash going from Todd having heard that Rafi was dead to him being on Maketea. Does this mean he really didn't sponsor the project because he had any feelings left about Rafi and his friendship?  Everything at the end with Maketea feels almost like a fantasy where everyone wins. In some ways it felt almost too neat after all the conflict that Todd just finished telling us about. However, maybe this just says more about me and my cynicism to be skeptical of a happy ending.!<

I am diving into Galetea 2.2 now, and am very excited to contrast the two views of AI almost 30 years apart, so if anyone has read both and have thoughts I would love to hear them.",normal

"Has anyone here read Playground by Richard Powers yet? It's been about two weeks now since ""Playground"" by Richard Powers was released. I just finished it today and was hoping to discuss it here.

I really enjoyed The Overstory even though the back half lost me a bit with the crime plot. I haven't read Bewilderment as I just finished The Overstory about a month ago, but it seems like maybe I haven't missed much there anyway.

Overall I enjoyed Playground but it felt derivative of The Overstory. The couple growing old together with a complicated relationship, the tech guy building an app that mirrors real life, the overarching theme of thoughtfulness about the environment. 

The first half or so was pretty slow. I wasn't particularly invested in Keane and Rafi's friendship. I also felt like Rafi (a black man) was written poorly, almost like a caricature. 

But then the last few pages hit and it all tied together, and I might need a re-read, because I think it changes the perspective of everything in the book. I think it also (maybe) excuses Powers writing the caricature, because it's not really ""him"" writing as an author but Keane's recollection and education of the AI.

"Is Mr Darcy just the fantasy of the emotionally unavailable man? I am definitely new to this subject so very curious what the general assessment is on this. 

But Darcy, to me in my late 30s, comes across as a man who is ‚Äúemotionally unavailable‚Äù and whose sudden interest becomes overwhelmingly flattering because he seems so hard to get. Then the emotions run high with constant conflict during courtship stirring up a lot of sexual tension. So that by the time they actually come together there‚Äôs a lot of emotional attachment but based more on drama than actual compatibility. 

The story ends there with a happily ever after, and I won‚Äôt say he and Elizabeth aren‚Äôt compatible but I do wonder if once the excitement cools, his more unpleasant qualities turn towards Elizabeth. She‚Äôs free and outspoken and he is more reserved and controlled. I could see him being a controlling partner or at least a major stuck in the mud. 

That said, Elizabeth‚Äôs options of men seem to be timelessly relatable: the good guy who‚Äôs not an option, the weird jerk, the nice guy who‚Äôs actually a jerk, and the jerk with the golden heart. 

Is Darcy‚Äôs golden heart just a hopeful projection that fades after the chase?

UPDATE: first of all, I just watched the Matthew McFadyen movie and can see why so many people have the perspectives they do about Darcy. 

I really love this conversation and am excited to finally be initiated into the lore. 

Based on just the book I do still feel like this is optimistic ‚Äúdiamond in the rough‚Äù fantasy like any early Disney fairytale. And I love these fantasies. But I think this book really nails the female perspective. 

Elizabeth seems to change her perspective upon learning more about Darcy. But Darcy‚Äôs perceived changes seem directed by selfish interests. His treatment of Elizabeth and his meddling in his friend‚Äôs relationship only changes when he takes a personal interest in Elizabeth, however earnest that may be. Alas, in the book, he‚Äôs the real deal and truly seems to grow. But my point is that in reality I think these scenarios end up painful and disappointing for the ‚ÄúElizabeth‚Äù. The fantasy is what makes this so enchanting for me though. ",normal

"Will you keep reading a good story with bad prose? What about a bad story with good prose? I've wrestled with this before. Some books have really intriguing characters, strong stories, and great plot twists - but they're written horribly. 

And I've seen the inverse - dull characters, weak or nonexistent motives, bland plots - but the prose is beautiful. It can paint a great picture in my head, it just doesn't end up being a particularly memorable one.

"I finished Shuggie Bain and I have many things to say  I picked up this book in mid-September and from the very first pages, I could understand that it would not be a pleasant journey. I decided to read this book slowly and take breaks in-between in order to savour it and recover a little once I felt it got too overwhelming. Even when I didn't read it, the book couldn't leave my mind. I found myself worrying over the characters, trying to guess what would happen next.

I admit that it took me a while to _fully_ get into the story. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED the book but it was kinda hard to dive deep into it at the beginning. There were moments which made me kinda bored and there were some parts which dragged and perhaps could have been excluded from the story. Nevertheless, once I dived head first into the book, I was able to appreciate it more. 

The writing was truly exceptional. It's almost hard to comprehend that this was the debut novel of Douglas Stuart. The writing style was mature, descriptive and raw. It did a wonderful job at portraying the characters and it highlighted the bleak atmosphere that surrounded the book. The rich descriptions of the buildings, the people, the working class and the sceneries gave me a better idea of what it would be like to live in '80s Glasgow's tenements and it was clear that the author was familiar with the hardships of poverty and Scottish society during these times. I also appreciated the depiction of the Scottish accent, it was really fun to read it aloud and it made the story more realistic.

The way Stuart wrote the characters is just great. They were flawed and far from perfect and they felt real. I felt many emotions towards them. But my heart aches for Agnes and Shuggie. I was desperate for them to finally find happiness. Although I was sometimes baffled with Agnes' actions, I couldn't blame her entirely. I don't know what it is like to live with an alcoholic and I hope I won't. Agnes was a woman which had to deal with her own demons. She made mistakes and she was trying to fight against her addiction. I found her to be a very complex character. On the one hand, I knowledged that she was not a saint and that she was partly at fault for how her life turned into. On the other hand...I felt sad. Sad for her because she was trying so hard to please a man who didn't truly love her. Sad because she was desperate to find her own happiness. Sad because although she clearly loved her children, she couldn't be a better mother because of alcoholism. Agnes was a flawed human being and even though, I understand why many readers disliked her, I really wished for her misery to end. 

At first, I found it odd that the book focused a lot on Agnes. I had expected that the novel would centre around Shuggie. But the more I think about it, the more I realise that by showcasing Agnes' battle with alcohol, we get to see how her actions affected those around her and how difficult Shuggie's task was. I think that it was important to witness Agnes' life and see how that affected Shuggie and the rest of the family. 

Out of all the characters, the one I loved the most was none other than the boy whose name is prefixed to the cover of the novel. Shuggie had a rough upbringing and ever since he was a small child, he had to endure his mother's fits and the bullying from the other kids. He became more mature and despite the misery around him, he somehow managed to remain optimistic. His love towarrds Agnes is beautiful and tragic. I personally couldn't believe how it was possible for him to live her so much, even though she was in such a bad state. He refused to abandon her, he didn't want to see her getting mistreated and until the very last moment, he just wished she could get back on her feet. Those around him warned him about her, they told him that she was a lost case. And yet he remained by her side, clinging to her and trying his best to help her. On top of that, he had to deal with his inner conflict about his sexuality while trying to fit in a society that constantly belittled him and his mother. His desperation to be considered ""normal"" was heartbreaking to say the least. It's such a bad feeling to feel unwelcome and to feel like you are wrong. I really wanted to hug him and reassure him that he's not wrong and that he's doing his best. 

One of my most favourite experts in the book is the part when Agnes encourages Shuggie to continue his dance, even though their neighbors, the McAvennies were watching and mocking him.  

>‚ÄúIf I were you, I would keep dancing.‚Äù
‚ÄúI can't‚Äù. His hands and fingers were still outstretched and frozen, like a dead tree. 
‚ÄúDon't give them the satisfaction. ‚Äù

This right here is one of the best scenes between Snuggie and Agnes. Agnes encourage Shuggie to do what he likes instead of worrying about the McAvennies and she showed him that he should feel comfortable expressing his freedom however he liked. She didn't feel ashamed by him and instead of making him hide his talent in dancing, she wanted to make him be free and not care about the other's opinion. 

The love between a mother and her children is explored well in the book. Although Agnes is not tender with her children, they still cared about her. Catherine and Leek still loved her but they weren't willing to deal with her if that meant that they would be prevented from chasing their own dreams. They wanted to escape from this void which makes total sense. Still, they cared about her. Shuggie and Leek who stayed with her for a longer time made sure to protect her as much as they could. They tried to prevent her from hurting herself or drink too much. Shuggie wanted to make her feel happy so when he saw that Agnes seemed happier around Eugene, he was bitter. Because as her son and as someone who cared deeply about her, he wanted to be _the one_ to make her laugh. He wanted to make her feel good. His love for his mother made him have more tolerance against her outbursts and condition and he tried to remain optimistic for the most part. He was just a kid who wanted the best for his mom. Even if that meant that he would have to sacrifice a part of himself in order to take care of her. 

So far in my life, I have never had any experience with addictions. None of my relatives have been alcoholics so I have no experience in this field. However, I could easily tell that Stuart's depiction of alcohol addiction came from the heart and that he _knew_ what it feels like to be with an alcoholic. Agnes' addiction to alcohol was portrayed in a raw, gut-wrenching way. It made me feel sad, angry, confused...Dealing with an addiction it's by no means pleasant. And it's not easy to recover either. Your actions affect those around you, you slowly destroy yourself and you find yourself trapped in a loop with no way to escape. When Agnes was one year sober, I truly felt salvation. I felt hopeful and I was optimistic that things would change for the best. But they didn't. And when Eugene pressured her to drink again, I was DEVASTATED. I almost screamed and cried from frustration. I considered throwing the book away. And as her addiction continued, I couldn't help but ask: when is this going to end? 

The ending was very beautiful in my opinion. One of the best endings I have read so far. I was sobbing for almost have an hour and my mom had to bring me tissues to wipe my tears. It's bittersweet yet realistic. Agnes' death broke me, especially when I read Shuggie's reaction. But at the same time, I knowledged that Shuggie couldn't do anything more. That was beyond his powers. He did what he had to do but his role as his mother's protector had come to an end. It was time to seize his own day and live his life. It's not easy. And he already has to deal with some problems. But there is still hope. There is hope for a brighter future, one when he will truly be free. 

>‚ÄúThere is no way Shuggie Bain can dance!‚Äù
Shuggie tutted. He wrenched himself from her side and ran a few paces ahead. He nodded, all gallus, and spun, just the once, on his polished shoes.

This quote right here makes me tear up everytine I think about it. For the first time, Shuggie is truly free. Free to dance publicly. Free to express himself. Free to become what he wants to. He finally feels comfortable with himself and he is not going to hide anymore. He will continue to ""dance"" and live his life in the best way possible. And that is an encouraging thought. 

As much as I LOVED, LOVED the book, I admit that there were certain aspects which I didn't like that much. As I mentioned above, some parts of the story could have been exluded, I definitely think that had the book been a little bit shorter, it would be slightly better. I also think that as much as I read liked reading about the characters, I feel like there was room for more development. It would be nice if Stuart had dived deeper into their personalities because there were ttimes when I felt like there was more beneath the surface. I understand why some people described them as ""two dimensional"" and I myself would have enjoyed something deeper. 

All in all, this is definitely a book that captured my heart. It's a book that deals with many difficult themes and made me feel many emotions. I don't think that I'll reread it anytime soon but I'll still be haunted by it for a really long time. I am looking forward for the tv series, I really hope we'll get more news about it eventually. If you're planning to read this book, do it. But check the trigger warnings first!  ",normal

"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother by Amy Chua was one of my more disappointing reads of the year. Wow, this book made me angry. It also made me really sad, and also even more conflicted about my own experience being raised in an Asian family. 

For those not in the know, this is a book by corporate lawyer and writer Amy Chua about her experience raising her two daughters in the ""traditional"" Chinese style - with academic and musical success, obedience, drive, and SUCCESS (oh, did I say that already?) being valued over all else. It's basically a memoir-style work detailing the most extreme form of ""tiger parenting.""

I read it out of curiosity (and to admit, maybe to see if I could find some of my own mother's voice in Chua's book?) and ended up with more than a few gripes. 

* First, the book was published at the wrong time. I think it could have been a lot more insightful if it was published after her children actually grew into adults. The so-called conclusion of the book includes her still-teenager daughters assuring her that they appreciated the way they were raised, and considered it a net positive. I don't know about you, but to me age 14 doesn't seem like the ideal time to get this opinion. It being published later would also give Chua more years to think and maybe make it possible for her to have one single self-reflective point throughout the entirety of the book.
* That sort of brings me into point 2. What is Chua even trying to say with this book? It kind of just seems provocative for the sake of provocation. Okay, you had your child practice for ten hours a day for ten years. You screamed, smashed glasses, never let your child pick extracurricular activities or have friends - at some point it just becomes *we get it.* What did you *learn?* What did you conclude about parenting? Do you think you did the right thing? It was a lot more ""here are some anecdotes about my children! I yelled a lot"" rather than the reflective POV I was expecting. I feel like Chua knew her book would be shocking to a Western audience and just leaned into that rather than make any effort to make her book meaningful.
* Finally, I feel like the most important thing to recognize about this book is that we're hearing about Amy Chua's parenting ""success"" because ultimately, her kids were able to survive it. Something I think not a lot of people want to acknowledge is that children actually are different - not in the ""everybody's special"" kind of way, but more matter-of-factly - some children are less able to handle pressure than others. Some are less intelligent, less driven, more prone to distraction. Some children are Yoon-seoks. (There is an anecdote in the book in which Chua's older daughter, Sophia, comes in second to a boy named Yoon-seok on a multiplication test. In response, Chua has Sophia drill multiplication for hours and hours until she comes in first every time for the rest of the year.) But what if Yoon-seok's parents were jut as invested in success as Chua? But no matter how much they drilled him, he just couldn't beat that other girl in his math class? What happens when it's not a math test, but he just can't beat her out for valedictorian, or that Harvard spot, or that job offer? According to Chua's parenting style, he'll be ""motivated"" by being called garbage every time. Maybe he turns out fine - just second place. Or maybe he becomes a maladjusted adult with anger issues, develops a drinking problem, enters a string of abusive relationships, engages in some combination of these, or just kills himself. And his story will never be told - it'll be ""shameful"" and hidden forever.

But there were some interesting questions I thought this book raised too. Is parenting simpler than Chua's making it? Can you leave your children to make decisions for themselves, just support them, and have them turn out fine? Or is it actually *more* complex than she says, and there's some kind of magical balance that needs to be struck? And what should we tolerate within the Asian community? How much of what Westerners consider ""abuse"" should we accept as part of our culture? None of it? Part of it? What parts? Why do Westerners get to define ""default"" parenting and Asian parenting is the deviation?

I'm still in high school, and have next to no experience when it comes to child-rearing, so I don't expect to get answers to these anytime soon, but I do wonder about it - especially when I catch myself thinking  about how to make sure my children will be in the highest reading group at school without also having them tearing up in the school bathroom over an ""In progress"" grade. I thought Chua might come up with something in over 200 pages, but she seemed more occupied with recitals & shock value.",normal

"The marketing shift from ""Philosopher's"" to ""Sorcerer's"" stone was a bad faith move I've heard the rumor for years that the first HP book's title was changed essentially because publishers thought American kids were too dumb to know what a philosopher was. 

But back in 1998, most of us that young (8-12ish) reading books that big would have had no problem with the word ""Philosopher."" And it wasn't as if ""sorcerer"" was really a big part of our standard lexicon either. 

So was it really the reason? If so, it seems like that they didn't really know their target audience. But that doesn't surprise me since most people (especially in the (US) don't give kids enough credit.

"Count Belisarius near unreadable I bought a historical fiction book Count Belisarius (2022 edition) by Robert Graves from a publisher called Seven Stories Press. The original book was published in the 1930's, and Graves isn't an unknown author; he also wrote the relatively well known and received I, Claudius. The editing in this printing is abysmal; like an error a page for at least 50 pages (I stopped reading after 50 pages). I'm not an especially strong editor and haven't taken a lit/eng course in about 10 years, but boy howdy look at how these errors stand out:

Pg. 3 ex, ""... he should never tum is head..."" instead of turn. I think the publisher scanned a faded 1930's printing and had chatgpt or something recreate the scan in a word processor. AI must have read 'rn' as 'm' (I speculate)



Page 4 ex, ""Whether or not he w true to the oath..."" W instead of were.



Page 7 ex, ""... and thus making the Cyclops drunk, thrust out his one eye with the Barning point."" Barning instead of burning. Barning unnecessarily capitalized.

Page 23 ex, ""It was there th.at..."" this error occurs twice on this page, both times with the word that.



Page 25 ex, ""convinced Christian a d somewhat scandalized..."" and missing an ""n."" Still has the spacing between a and d though.



Page 26 ex, ""water dock, of which he is so proud and which keeps such poOI; time,"" dock instead of clock, poOI instead of poor. Random ; inserted. Again, somehow two letters, 'c' and 'l' combined to form a 'd.' Why...?



Page 35 ex, ""(This was the other Thracian, a land owner}"" Brackets don't match. Happens more than once.



Page 43 ex, ""the stone by which the tome was dosed..."" dosed instead of closed. 



Page 43 ex, ""a great number oi: rich...'' oi should be of; weird insertion of colon



Page 43 ex, ""New Years Da'y..."" You understand



Page 43 ex, ""walls, floor, and roo¬£..."" That is a pound Sterling in place of an 'f'.

  
This isn't an exhaustive list of errors; I just picked out some of my favorite examples to keep the list short but demonstrative of different types of errors. I've contacted Seven Stories Press 3 times with no response back, so I guess I'm just stuck with a bricked book. Anyone experience anything similar with publishers? Is there anything I can do?

"How do you guys remember the plot of all the books you've read?  I read a decent amount of books (anywhere between 25‚Äì60) every year. Unfortunately, I find that I can barely remember the plot of most of the books, except for the central overarching theme, even as less as 6 months later. 

I've tried the usual methods, such as annotating and active reading, as well as writing goodreads reviews for each. But they don't seem to work too well. 

I understand that there are biological determinants and cognitive differences that affect each person's recall abilities, but if you guys have any tips to remember what you read, please do share! ",normal
"I totally missed the point of this book and now I'm sad. The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet by Becky Chambers EDIT: Someone mentioned this and I couldn't agree more! My problem wasnt the book so much as it was the advertisement. The marketing was waaaay off for this book. For context, this book was suggested after Red Rising....if you've read Red Rising, you would understand how I was totally caught off guard by this book. 

First, Im aware this will come out kinda harsh but I am just really disappointed by how this turned out. Becky Chambers is an awesome writer that I would have loved to love

I am a sucker for a good space epic so when I found The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet, I thought it checked all the boxes. Space colonies, war, illegal arms dealing, lust for power, adventure through the dangers of uncharted space. The characters were complex and likeable sure, but it was the world building that sold me. It was so interesting how each alien species had their own cultures, languages, biases, and social status and how it shaped the formation of this interplanetary government. So when another violent alien race comes into the picture that no one really knows about, its the perfect set up for a killer series.

I was so excited for this story to start until it just...didn't. I was expecting a fast paced, action packed rollercoaster, but instead it felt like 330 pages of opening credits. Instead of diving into this amazing story line, we get three different love stories (more like 2 love stories and 1 oddly placed and unecessary lesbian alien sex scene just because). We get a story of friendship and learning to live with others and random side characters with no other purpose than to cause nostalgia and fill up space on the page and so on and on and on....

All of this squishy slice of life writing wouldn't be an issue by itself, her writing style is very well done. The issue I have is when this soft (and kinda boring) day to day life idea is sitting ontop of an absolute SIFI goldmine in world building. And I thought, ""okay, maaaybe book 1 was just character building for the story progression in book 2."" NOPE, all of the books following never fully circle back around to the crew or the plot of book 1, leaving plenty of questions and confusion as to why it was ever created in the first place. Such a terrible waste of a wonderful thing.

Did anyone else feel this way too? Did anyone like the idea of focusing on the characters in the midst of the chaos instead of the chaos itself? While you're at it, please drop any suggestions on books that might be more my speed if you've got any!",normal

"Sex-positive nonfiction books for people who want to explore this topic Many of the books my friends and I are reading fall fall under the ‚Äòsex-positive‚Äô umbrella. With that being said, it‚Äôs such a broad term. 

What does sex positivity mean to you?¬†

These are five recommendations from us that cover the wanting, wistful and the wonderful - everything from ethics and politics of sex through to relationships in the modern age, intimacy and desire. 

Tomorrow Sex Will Be Good Again by Katherine Angel¬†  
Focussing on women, specifically in the age of consent, and a huge uprising of violence against women and girls, Katherine Angel urges that we remake our thinking about sex, pleasure, and autonomy without any illusions about perfect self-knowledge. How can women, in this environment, possibly know what they want? And why do we expect them to? Answers on a postcard.¬†

Don't Hold My Head Down by Lucy-Anne Holmes  
Written by Lucy when she couldn‚Äôt find the book she wanted to read, Lucy explores the world of sex and realises everything is geared to male pleasure rather than to women's. But Lucy didn‚Äôt let that stop her - in search of ‚Äúsome brilliant fucking‚Äù, Lucy penned a list. ‚ÄúLess bucket, more fuck it‚Äù, she notes as she set out to find out what her sex life was missing.   
  
Want by Gillian Anderson  
Gillian Anderson (Sex Education, The X Files, etc.) has compiled a compendium of anonymous sexual fantasies of women from around the world - and included her own anonymous submission. These secret stories are full of desire, fear, intimacy, shame, satisfaction and, ultimately, liberation.   
If you‚Äôre looking to revel in someone else‚Äôs fantasies, or even reconcile some of your own then these fantasies provide a window into the most secret part of our minds - and Gillian‚Äôs inviting you in.  
  
Mating in Captivity, Esther Perel  
In this book, Esther asks the hard questions - does intimacy always equal hot sex, and can we crave what we already have? Analysing sex in committed couples, Ester is determined to reconcile the erotic and the domestic and explains why democracy is a passion killer in the bedroom. She argues for playfulness, distance, and uncertainty. And shows what it takes to bring lust home. 

Rough by Rachel Thompson¬†  
To give it its full title, Rough is about how violence crept into the bedroom, and what we can do about it. Through powerful testimony from 50 women and non-binary people, this book shines a light on the sexual violence that takes place in our bedrooms and beyond, sometimes at the hands of people we know, trust, or even love. Rachel Thompson notes that it's time for a societal shift. ‚ÄúAs individuals with agency within our sexual culture we have the power to remodel our behaviour and this book shows us how.‚Äù",normal
"Autumn by Ali Smith... Maybe not for me Hi. I've just read this book and I don't love it (to put it politely), but probably it was my fault, and that's what I want to ask you. I read the book, connect with the characters in a few chapters, but I miss some conflict in the story. For me, without conflict you don't have a story. I was waiting for a problem to be solve, but then I realized, at page 200, that it will not be any. Probably is my fault, because I used to read books with ""the hero's journey"" structure: hero -> conflict -> resolution (to put in three words), but here I don't have that.  
So, What are your impressions about the book? Is it only the story of a relation? Why do you like it?  
I'm hoping to find in your answers that ""something"" that make me understand the book.",normal

I just thought the book revolved around the Count meeting a bunch of strangers in a hotel‚Ä¶that‚Äôs it. Ending seemed rather predictable too. 

I had some support here for not enjoying All The Light We Cannot See, which also got very high praise. But I‚Äôm not so sure I‚Äôll get the same support since I see nothing but amazing things about AGIM. It‚Äôs been hit or miss recently with historical fiction. On to the next one I suppose!

Interesting article about frustrating problem. Have you every been recomended a really good book only to find that you have already read IT but completely forgot?

"'A Sand County Almanac' is being very hard for me to enjoy. I really like some forms of nature writing. Thoreau's *Walden* and Emerson's essay *Nature* are some of my top favourites.

In this regard, I picked up Aldo Leopald's highly acclaimed work *A Sand County Almanac*. So far I've read about 25% of the book and boy oh boy.. it has been a really tough read for me. 

What I find the most difficult is the landscape he is describing and the activities he wrote about, the whole chapters upon chapters 
 - are just totally unrelatable to me. I don't really get a visual picture of what he's describing. 

I'm an aspiring writer myself and I do have to say that some of the sentences he wrote are really insightful and the vocabulary he uses is great.. But that's about it. Other than a few sentences here and there, I'm not getting much out of it. It's a bit embarrassing to say for someone who wants to be a serious literary writer.

I guess my intellectual capabilities aren't yet sufficient to enjoy this apparently classic work of ecological writing. (Any tips on that?)

Now the inevitable question: *Am I the only one?*",normal
"Book jacket tells me nothing I just read the fragile threads of power by V. E. Schwab. I picked this book up and thought it looked intriguing so I decided to read it. It was pretty good, but I was confused about the characters at the beginning until the book really got going. By the end, I thought it was entertaining enough that I was hoping for book 2. When I started researching, if there was going to be a book 2 and when it would be released, I realized that this book is based off an entirely different trilogy. (Shades of Magic series). Nowhere on the book jacket does it tell me that this was a continuation of another story, or that this author created/written previous stories that would have helped me understand the plot and characters faster. I'm just so frustrated that I missed the first part. I would've gotten those books before this one had  I known. V. E. Schwab is missing out because her book jackets are lacking information. I have to say I hate it when I pick up a book in the jacket does not describe what the book is about, or if there is a previous story to read first, and all it is is praises and quotes from The NY Times best sellers list. Just tell me what the stories about, so I can decide whether or not I want to read you. I very rarely read books that I don't know brief synopsis of first...when I (hopefully) get published one day, I'll make sure readers know what's going on by reading the book jacket. End of rant.

"I didn't understand Little Altars Everywhere by Rebecca Wells Exactly what the title says. I just finished Little Altars Everywhere and I feel like I'm missing something. The book felt like a series of meandering anecdotes about sad, lonely characters that ended up going nowhere. The best part of the book was when various characters would reflect on the land and their relationship to their hometown, but most of it was taken up with various stories of their dysfunctional relationships and home life. Can anyone tell me what the point of this book is, and/or why people seem to enjoy it so much?",normal
"One Day is a book about flawed people, and that‚Äôs a good thing. Spoiler Alert: This review contains spoilers for the book, movie, and TV show.

First, I need to get this off my chest (even though I know this is r/books): ANNE HATHAWAY WAS MISCAST AS EMMA MORLEY. Emma is strong-headed, opinionated, and stubborn, but Anne‚Äôs portrayal was more like the ‚Äúcute nerd‚Äù stereotype, which felt wrong for the character. I think Ambika nailed Emma in the TV show, and I can‚Äôt believe the hate she received just because of her looks. She brought Emma to life perfectly, and I‚Äôll die on this hill.

Now, let‚Äôs get into the book.

A lot of people seem to dislike One Day for various reasons, and we‚Äôre all entitled to our opinions, but here‚Äôs my take on some of the common criticisms:

	1.	The characters aren‚Äôt likeable: I get it, especially with Dexter. He‚Äôs not meant to be likeable all the time, but that‚Äôs part of what makes him compelling. Dexter had everything handed to him‚Äîprivilege, charm, opportunity‚Äîand he squandered it. He‚Äôs deeply flawed, but his journey of regret and self-destruction feels real. He faces the consequences of his actions and feels the weight of his choices, which is why I think he was written well. Honestly, I found him even more interesting in the TV show.
Emma, on the other hand, is someone I relate to deeply. She‚Äôs smart and idealistic, but also judgmental and a bit lost in her own ego. People argue it‚Äôs unrealistic that she couldn‚Äôt get a good job, but I think it‚Äôs more about her expectations and pride holding her back. She‚Äôs a social justice warrior in her early 20s, but reality hits hard, and she struggles to find her place. Her affair with a married man didn‚Äôt make me angry, just sad for her, because she‚Äôs so lost. I love how she‚Äôs a late bloomer‚Äîthere‚Äôs something hopeful about her figuring things out later in life, which resonates with me as someone in their mid-20s who also feels a bit directionless. Her growth gave me hope.
	2.	Emma‚Äôs death is pointless: I knew it was coming, having seen the movie first, but it didn‚Äôt make me mad. Sometimes life is sudden like that. The real tragedy isn‚Äôt her death itself but the wasted years Dexter and Emma spent apart, miscommunicating, and letting their egos get in the way. There‚Äôs a message there‚Äîdon‚Äôt wait to make things right, because life doesn‚Äôt always give you time.
	3.	The story feels choppy: I won‚Äôt argue with this one. The ‚Äúone day every year‚Äù format does leave gaps, and I would‚Äôve loved to see key moments fleshed out more‚Äîlike their wedding, the time they slept together after Dexter‚Äôs divorce, or Dexter learning about Emma‚Äôs death. But there‚Äôs something charming about the way you have to piece things together from their conversations. It‚Äôs like catching up with old friends after a long time apart, where you‚Äôre filling in the blanks and realizing how much has changed.

All in all, it‚Äôs not a perfect book by any means, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I might even prefer the TV show (controversial opinion, I know). If you‚Äôve read the book and seen the adaptations, I‚Äôd love to hear what you thought!",normal

"Shirley Jackson I‚Äôve started to read Shirley Jackson‚Äôs work over the last few years. Thus far I‚Äôve read three of her novels: Hangsaman, The Haunting of Hill House, and I just finished We Have Always Lived in the Castle. (Which was phenomenal by the way.) To me her writing feels unique - and I can‚Äôt understand why her work is not something that is talked about more on the level of say Steinbeck or Fitzgerald or Hemingway. Her work is excellent and I‚Äôm struggling to understand why it wasn‚Äôt celebrated more as a great American writer. Is it because it was more gothic in tone or because she was a woman? Why wasn‚Äôt she on the recommended reading lists? Do they talk about her now in school? I‚Äôd really love to hear some perspective on her - as I feel like she is really overlooked. Or am I not looking in the right places? ",normal
"The Family Fang, by Kevin Wilson.  Can't tell if it's deep or I'm reading into it, ether way, I would recommend it Had this book on my shelf for a while, just finished it and wow, what a great book.  It wasn't ""funny"" to me, but interesting, quirky, weird, cool.   If you're not familiar with it, it's about two kids A and B, now adults, growing up with parents Camille and Caleb, who are performance artists who would include them in their ""happenings""  and as adults they are dealing with it. 

I wonder if it's an intentional look at  the question ""What is art?""  ""What makes someone an artist?"" The dad, Caleb, has literally ""bled for his art"" and again, was this intentional or am I reading into it? 

I think the book is so well written, the characters are somewhat relatable,  some of it is just out there and I really enjoyed it.     

If you've read it, what do you think?  Does it get into philosophical questions about art, or am I making too much of it?",normal

"I could not finish ‚ÄúOn the Road‚Äù by Jack Kerouac I had always heard of this book as being regarded highly and thought I was someone who enjoyed ‚Äústream of consciousness‚Äù writing‚Ä¶. But I could just not get through this, it felt like a total slog.

The general premise of being on the road and exploring is very interesting and I was drawn in quickly but it just felt like the book never really evolved from there.

Sal and his friends are just always off seeking another adventure. For the most part they‚Äôre kind of just sleazy guys trying to skirt responsibility. Which I think is the point? That the ‚Äúon the road‚Äù lifestyle is hedonistic fun but fleeting and also damaging to your morality?

The general themes and premise were interesting but after 200 pages of Kerouac describing parties and sweating and cars, it just started to turn into a slog where it felt like everything was being beat over your head over and over again.

"Have you ever re-read a favourite book from your childhood and been astounded by a layer you didn't see as a kid, or by something that you now see in a new way? I'm definitely a re-reader, and will often choose books from my childhood to enjoy again. I love going back to a world that's had an impact on me (part nostalgia, part just what my particular reader-imagination craves!)

In re-reading a few Judy Blume books - namely Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing, Superfudge, and Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great - I  find myself literally astounded at how deftly Blume portrays adult characters, despite them being secondary characters who remain mostly ""in the wings"" of the main story. As a kid, I accepted what the adults did and said as a matter of course - and I think that's what her young central characters do, too.

But now as an adult, I can see and feel the adults' midlife crises, career angst, complicated financial decisions, dynamics with extended family and other parents... These are not know-it-all grown ups, nor are they bumbling, clueless types where the kids know best. They are living, breathing, flawed (sometimes humorously), loving ""whole"" people. And again, what impresses me most  - especially when reading now - is how Blume does not write pages and pages about any of the above and none of it with a heavy hand; these details are simply what come through in little snippets of action and effortless dialogue as the young characters go about their kid-centric lives.

So I'd love to know: what childhood books look different to you - and how so - when you read them in adulthood?",normal

"When the book is just average. On this subreddit, a book is usually either praised, called a masterpiece, or scolded and called one of the worst. But I'm wondering which books are just average for you. It's not the worst thing you've read in your life, but it's not good either. 

For me, this is the ""The Atlas Six"" by Olivie Blake. This is a dark academy-style book about six magicians who are fighting for a place in Alexandrian society. In this book, most of the time nothing happens except that the characters drink, say how smart they are and how others are just garbage, develop broken tactics, a lot of pretentious philosophical speeches, and the characters are cardboard and pretentious. 

But I don't think it's a really bad book. When something starts happening in a book, it's interesting to read (it's a pity that the most interesting thing here takes only 10 percent). And the world of the book is interesting and I want to learn a lot more about it.

"Ending of Labyrinth of the Faun (Pan's Labyrinth novelization) - what just happened? Some thoughts, more questions.  So I just finished the book and I'm confused. I could only find threads about the movie and none about the book, so I'm posting one.

If we take everything at face value, Orphelia is Moana and upon completing the tasks and proving she's still deserving, she gets to return to the Underworld Kingdom and rule for centuries.

Except why are the King and Queen, her parents, the same people (the tailor and Karmen)? She recognizes them. One interpretation is that they went out to search for Moana, but just like her, ended up forgetting their real selves - and the 3 of them kept getting reborn? Which would mean that Karmen, weak, tragic Karmen who emotionally abandoned her daughter to chase the love of the sadistic new guy she hoped would save her, is...a Queen? What?

Another, darker option is that the throne room scene was a figment of dying Orphelia's imagination. But that doesn't seem possible in the book, as the epilogue makes it pretty clear that Moana really did come back and rule etc. Right?

And why are the fairies suddenly alive again? And what was up with the darkness - Orphelia talking about the book being corrupted, the Fawn being dodgy, him and the fairies eating raw bloody meat - that just suddenly goes away in the final scene and they're all gold and good? I understand that the Underworld is supposed to be very different from our imperfect world - but why were the fawn and fairies different here? Were they corrupted by our world, and going back restored them? Or is it another piece of evidence that the final scene isn't ""real""?

All in all, amazing book, quickly became one of my all-time favorites, but I'm left with so many questions.

"Why are books different sizes? When my book collection only occupied a couple of shelves I arranged them by size. The various sizes bothered me so that was one way to keep my tiny collection visually organized.

It may seem stupid, but the visual chaos of seeing rows of books in different heights and widths continues to bother me. Surely I am not the only one? I don‚Äôt understand the point of making books all these different sizes. They should all be uniform (like CD cases and vinyl records as an example). I understand thickness because some books are longer or shorter than others. But I wish height and width would be standardized.

Of course there are exceptions, like coffee table books, technical manuals, textbooks, map books, etc. But our everyday reading material should be the same standard size. Please, publishers, reduce the visual clutter. My slightly OCD brain can‚Äôt take it. And I know I‚Äôm not the only one.",normal

"Riddley Walker, Flowers for Algernon, and the Art of writing English as a Foreign Language. I‚Äôm knee deep in Russel Hoban‚Äôs Riddley Walker, set in an age where written language is forgotten and spoken language has mutated in its own way. As such, the whole of the book is written in this English which makes it hard to understand ‚Äî but there‚Äôs more. It lends itself to wordplay and indulges the inner etymologist in you, often urging you read things out loud as opposed to reading the text internally. I include a sample here :

>! Being the Big 2 they only done ther 4 shows a year regler plus special is now and then but they liket to look like ful time Eusa show men they kep ther faces shavit and all. Orfing the littl 1 he carrit the fit up and Goodparley the big 1 he carrit the weapons the same as regler Eusa show partners done even tho they cudve had the hevvys carry the fit up and the weapons and them as wel. Goodparley had a big face with littl eyes like lookouts looking over the top of a fents and he wer all ways smyling with his big sqware teef. Orfing had a face like a limpit.!<

Along with teaching you the language by context, Hoban intentionally doesn‚Äôt reveal the meaning of certain words until you need to know them. At first these caused frustration but when I did gain knowledge that was hidden so far, it was a beautiful quenching of the thirsting mind. 

Along with this delightfully touching marvel of writing, one of my favourites Flowers for Algernon also uses this device - it is simply the protagonist‚Äôs tongue, and not that of the writer √† la Finnegans Wake. 

What are your views? And do you know other such books?",normal

"‚ÄúThe scapegoat‚Äù by Daphne du Maurier was amazing‚Ä¶ up before the ending.  She was an amazing writer and I‚Äôve found myself indulging in her work and her interesting stories full of the gothic and horror-like element. After a big break of reading, the scapegoat was what made me remember how much I love books. 


The story is so interesting, almost relatable to its overall questions. ‚ÄúIf you could change place with someone and escape your life of misery would you do it?‚Äù. 
The characters had so much personality, you could see their thoughts, pains and emotions throughout the chapters, everyone had something they wanted to do but couldn‚Äôt till the end. Even the protagonist, who sometimes can be the most complicated part of a story, to me seemed really well written all things considered. 

I loved reading it up until the last two chapters, when the real Jean comes back. I feel like it was really rushed, the ending not only wasn‚Äôt dramatic enough it also didn‚Äôt really have anything surprising or interesting deserving of a story such as this one. John immediately complies with his wish and just leaves. I was expecting him to go back and tell everyone what actually happened, or find a way to kill him after all. But in the end he just decides to leave. I also don‚Äôt like their last conversation with Bella, I think he had a reason for calling Jean a ‚Äúdevil‚Äù, her going around that and saying that he isn‚Äôt, after everything we‚Äôve seen Jean do, is just bad to me. He is a bad person, he murdered innocent people, he sees the bad in everyone even his own daughter, he literally admitted he will kill again in the future. But no supposedly everyone has a bad side so it‚Äôs ok? 
In a way, Jean literally destroying John‚Äôs life is symbolic, yes he hated his life so it‚Äôs like a forced new beginning, but come on John. He literally took everything from you and you will just leave like that? 


I‚Äôm just really disappointed of the ending. You could say it‚Äôs symbolic but to me it‚Äôs just really lacking and it‚Äôs such a shame because I really enjoyed it overall.

How do you chose your next book?  Everytime I finish a book and want to statt a new one I just go and scroll for like 30 minutes on my to read list then go and do something else and forget about the new book that I was choosing so is there like a system that you go by to chose or is it just what you feel like reading in the current moment?,normal

"Just finished Poppy War. It was very good, but not great. I did not write any spoilers in my post.

This was an interesting read. I've been processing my thoughts and I felt like throwing them into the forums of the internet.

I don't mind any of the historical events being portrayed in a magic fantasy novel. I've read a lot of people say that they thought it was done in poor taste. However, Kuang did successfully shine a flashlight on real tragedies. It got a lot of people talking about some atrocious historical events. 

To be honest, I have always practiced death of the author whenever I experience media. I don't care if an author is an evil person. I've always separated the art from the artist completely. 

So any criticisms that I have are regarding the quality of the novel. I do feel like there are valid criticisms. My main complaint is that the quality of her prose is not consistent. I would also say that there are a lot of segments that are poorly framed and paced. 

I find this pretty frustrating. It is hard to know that an author is capable of very dynamic prose, yet unable to consistently apply quality writing. 

I've read many novels by Ursula Le Guin and she is very consistent in the high quality of writing throughout each of her books. Le Guin also wrote her most well known fantasy series as a young adult book. Yet, it definitely does not come across as a YA book. Conversely, Kuang isn't writing a YA book here, but it reads like one.

The Poppy War comes across as often sophomoric and unpolished to me. That is to be expected from a debut novel. If Kuang continues to develop her craft I am definitely excited to see what she cooks up. 

Some of the scenes were so well done! There's this one scene where a man is hanging from a building as a crowd of bystanders helplessly watch. The scene really stuck with me. 

There's a lot of little moments that convey perfectly what they are meant to. Pictures are painted vividly and I have been totally engrossed within them. Unfortunately, directly following these moments, there will be 10 pages of YA banter. 

I would give the book a 7.5/10. I'm glad to have read it, and I would recommend it to others. Far above average, but not mind-blowing. 

To anyone that has read the full series: is it worth continuing? I'm currently leaning on not continuing. I am working on the Malazan book of the fallen series, this has been a relaxing detour! ",normal
"Local Bookstores or Chain Bookstores? For long as I have been into reading and books I've always gotten most of my books from a chainlink bookstore. Years ago when I was younger it was Borders then it became Barnes and Noble. Then I sometimes get books off of Amazon. 

There really hasn't ever been local bookstops around where I live. The only one in my town that's been around for years just had older books and really nothing current. And the other one that wasn't too far away was very small and not alot of options.

This year though I decided to go into this bookstore in a plaza area not far from my town. I had never been inside it before and decided to check out. I ended up loving it. It was the right size not too big and not too small. I ended up finding the books I wanted but couldn't find when I went into Barnes and Noble.

I've been back a couple times and each time they have books that Barnes and Noble don't have in the store and I discover books that would be hard to discover or wouldn't even be in a mainstream bookstore.

Do you prefer local bookstores or mainstream bookstores? Do you like both? Do you go to one for certain genres and the other for a different genre?",normal
"Disappointed with The 7 Husbands of Evelyn Hugo I know a lot of people liked this book, so I'm gonna apologize in advance, but this was not good. If you don't really want to hear me rant, I'd suggest you don't read this post.

Also, lots of spoilers.

I expected quite a lot more from this book, but I couldn't even bring myself to finish it.

I checked a few spoiler-free reviews before, and they were all 5 stars. Not sure how that is possible.

The story promises a lot from the very beginning. The secret life of a Marilyn Monroe-like celebrity... All the sordid details and secrets of her life... A story worth 12 million dollars... But all of that amounts to a generic, boring, and poorly-paced story.

The introduction to Monique is fine, albeit cliche. Struggling writer who wants to climb to the top. Heard all of that before. Nothing really exciting there.

The mystery of Evelyn Hugo on the other hand is well introduced. Who is she? Why did she marry 7 times? Why does she want to meet Monique?

And then she starts telling her story, and nothing she ever says is ground-breaking.

Her childhood was quickly skipped. She mentions her dreams of becoming famous, making her mother proud and leaving her abusive father.

All of that is fine, but it seems that the author forgot the most important rule of story-telling: SHOW DON'T TELL.

We never see any of the bad stuff. And not just that, a few pages later, she's married and ready to leave Hell's Kitchen. WHAT??? YOU'RE GONNA SKIP YOUR CHILDHOOD JUST LIKE THAT???

Where was the struggle? Why should I care about you, Evelyn? It didn't really sound like you went through much. You're just another Mary Sue.

Edit:

Yes, a Mary Sue. And there are several types of Mary Sue. It's not just someone who is flawless. It can be someone who is good at everything. Or someone for whom characters behave differently and reality bends to meet their needs. And that's exactly what happens throughout Evelyn's life. One day she is single and hopeless, the next day she's met a gullible guy who agrees to take her somewhere else. None of that happens so quickly in the real world. And even if it does, Evelyn finds a ways to make all of this sound plain and boring.

And BTW, a Mary Sue doesn't necessarily have to be a bad character. The fact that she is a Mary Sue is irrelevant. Like I said, the problem is that she doesn't ever delve into details. We only get a surface level story.

End edit.

She then starts her career as an actress in the most generic way possible. As a waitress who meets a producer at whatever place she was. And not just that, she did it again in just a few pages.

Again, WHERE WAS THE STRUGGLE YOU OVERCAME???

She quickly becomes a famous movie star with a rising career in just a few pages.

WHERE WAS THE STRUGGLE???

Edit:

I'm not saying that there needs to be a struggle. What I mean by this is that Evelyn has given us the very condensed version of her story and she's left out anything that would make it relatable or interesting.

End edit.

She starts dating and eventually marries Don, who turns out to be a terrible human being.

This is where it actually got good for a moment, and I finally felt like the story was gonna get interesting.

The scene of the first time he attacks her is very well done. This is what I wanted to see. You're finally SHOWING us that you did struggle. That the life of movie star is not just glamour and happiness.

The problem comes next. The book had been so completely rushed as of that point, that I felt the change in pacing 10 times more annoying than it should've been. Evelyn's previous divorce was SO fast that it felt only natural that she would divorce Don a few pages later, but the story just kept dragging on and on and on... for several hours.

It really was tedious to read about their marriage. The whole time I was thinking, why hasn't she divorced him yet? You claim to be smart and manipulative, but you're being really dumb now. The book hasn't given us any reason for which you can't divorce him other than the fact that staying with him keeps the cameras on you, which is a lame reason.

And yes, I know she claims to be in love for the first time in her life, but none of that shows in the pages! Their relationship is as dull as can be. Dancing a little bit and eating at restaurants. REALLY EVELYN??? 12 MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS GARBAGE???

Her relationship with Celia was also rushed. They had one or two good scenes together that were good but not great. I started to like Celia a bit, but the romance felt forced because it didn't have time to grow. Like I said, ONLY 1 or 2 good sexually charged scenes together and then made them a couple? No, that's not enough!

The best chemistry between couples comes from waiting and getting to know each other. We don't even know enough about Celia to care about her character. All we know is that she is obsessed with Evelyn. AND THAT'S NOT ENOUGH!

Her friendship with Harry was also boring at best (to be fair, all the characters are boring). He was there for emotional support, but it never really felt like he mattered. He offered to help many times, but he never really did anything important. He felt nothing more than like an extra in a movie.

And then we FINALLY get to the divorce. And the story can FINALLY continue.

A new problem is introduced, and as always, Evelyn solves it effortlessly and without any struggle. Her career is saved in just a few pages because she landed a role in an international film.

Wow. Exciting, isn't it? No. Not really.

At this point she's proven she can do anything the plot needs her to do. So why should I care if her career was momentarily ruined for 20 minutes?

Her marriage to Mick was another sort of exciting point in the story, but I was so numb at that point that I didn't care much for it.

And then I finally decided to DNF the book. I'm halfway through it, and there's no sign it will get any better. I could've finished it, but I see no point in doing that. It's only mediocre at best.

I read a quick summary just to know if the promised twist would be good enough to hook me again, but it's not. It's as generic as can be.

I will say though that I'm disappointed in myself for not having figured it out. I had several theories, but I wasn't able to deduce why she specifically wanted Monique to write her book.

Edit: I appreciate the people who are both offering to tell me the ending of the book or doing so. But, as mentioned in the post, I already read a summary to see if it was worth revisiting. So, yes, I already know about Monique's father. Still, I don't feel it changes anything about my opinions on this book.

Edit 2: Thanks for the nice comments! Only a few people say I demand too much from this book. As if demanding good writing, better characterizations, and better pacing was unreasonable. It's the minimum we should expect from any book.

I will say though that I read Jennette McCurdy's I'm Glad my Mother Died last year, and it's really increased my standards in historical fiction (even though it's non-fiction). And I think it's valid to compare them because they are both, for the most part, autobiographies of famous hollywood stars.

And let's not forget that from the very beginning, Evelyn tells Monique that she wants her to write her life story. So, the fact that Evelyn is unable to speak like a real person, provide details like a real person, or tell stories that feel real and not made up shows how little mastery in writing the author has.

If that was a 10, this is a 2. And if anyone had told me this was written by AI, I would have believed it because the story lacks depth and characterization. We only see the surface level of Evelyn's life, and it feels like the first draft of a story rather than a finished product.

But hey, if you enjoyed this book, I'm glad. Obviously, no one likes to be in the minority that dislikes something, but it sometimes happens.",normal
"You shouldn‚Äôt have come here - What did you think? Wrapped up this ‚Äúthriller‚Äù which felt more like a country romance, today. 

The audiobook narration was spot on, and if all narrators read this way, I‚Äôd be hooked. 

The book felt like a country song about blue eyes, ranches, blue jeans and beers. 

The last 10% of the book is where things got interesting and while the twist was entertaining, it felt too simple. Too flat. 

My takeaway from this book: Anyone can be a NYT best selling author if you just write something. (I‚Äôm kidding, mostly) ",normal
"What was the worst (cringe inducing/poorly written/obtuse) book you've suggested for a book club? I'll go first, it still feels like this was yesterday, even though it was over a decade ago.  I like reading pretty much all things, as long as it's well written, and well, not everyone is that way.  I came to book club with some suggestions for our next book, one of the being ""The Stupidest Angel"" by Christopher Moore (which I still haven't read, but I'm sure it's great) but instead went with Zombie by Joyce Carol Oates (we voted I didn't make an executive decision I swear!)  You more than likely haven't read this book, but a brief synopsis is that it's a first person account of a serial killer rapist with a limited mental capacity.  It's dark, but well written, and I liked it as I think Joyce Carol Oates has some great prose and ability as a writer.  So, I come prepared with ton of questions and enthusiasm, and what I got was a non-discussion.  Basically no one read the book, and/or found the subject matter so off putting that they felt they could not discuss it.  Not only did it ruin the book club meeting but probably ruined some of the members whole month.  I sometimes lay in bed wondering if the members of that group think I'm an uncultured disturbed individual with no feelings or emotions around such heavy topics.",normal
"Can Someone Help Me Like Durrell's Alexandria Quartet? **What am I missing about The Alexandria Quartet?** I really want to like it. 

tl;dr- I've had it on my shelf for a long time and read great reviews and see that it's praised, but... I'm just not feeling it and I'd love for someone to share their passion for it in hopes that I can be encouraged to continue reading it.

I (literally really) never DNF books, but I‚Äôve finished the first volume of four (*Justine*) of Durrell‚Äôs *Alexandria Quartet*, and while it was really **just** okay, I‚Äôd have been more positive about it were there not three more volumes to follow that apparently center around or retell the same happenings from a different perspective.¬†

It reminds me a bit of Powell‚Äôs *Dance to the Music of Time*, which I devoured in just a few months. The 12 novels were humorous, heartfelt, and although at times a bit slow, overall endearing and enjoyable. This was largely due, I felt, to them not overselling themselves: they felt somewhat lighthearted and easy reading, but for *AQ*, it‚Äôs falling a little bit flat for how epic or deep (or something) I expected it to be (and others talked about it being). I guess I just don‚Äôt find it very compelling, in a word.¬†

Usually there‚Äôs at least *something* about a book, even if I don‚Äôt care for it much, that redeems it: lovable or interesting characters, aphorisms, beautiful writing, something, and while I find the writing beautiful in some places, overall I‚Äôm just not into it and find the thought of reading the next 600+ pages just not very appealing.¬†

This book has high ratings on Goodreads and StoryGraph (also a plug to StoryGraph if you don‚Äôt know about it!), but I‚Äôm just not into it. I would love to hear anyone‚Äôs input or perspective about loving this book and why, because it might help me reframe it, or know what to look for, or something. I‚Äôd love for someone‚Äôs enthusiasm for this book to be contagious and help me find some interest in finishing it. 

(Additionally, I‚Äôm reading this because I‚Äôm working through [Modern Library‚Äôs Top 100 List](https://sites.prh.com/modern-library-top-100), and it‚Äôs no. 70 on the list. A high school lit teacher passed that list out to us and over the past 20+ years, I‚Äôve been working on 100%-ing it, and i‚Äôm at about 70 now. Some outstanding reads there, some less so.)¬†

"Sophie's Choice - what am I missing? I picked up Sophie's Choice at a used-book sale -it's one of those books I've heard about but never read. Settled in, psyched for a new favorite.

I hated it. Padded, wordy, uninteresting, with dull characters badly presented, full of pointless repetition. I read maybe 100 pages, flipped through the rest (it's way too long) to see if it improved, then tossed it.

I rarely react so negatively to a book with such a high reputation, so I wonder if I missed something. Anybody else read it and like to give a different perspective?

"The Dark Forest  I just finished reading this and can't wait to share my excitement!!

After reading the first book in the series, I didn‚Äôt expect to enjoy The Dark Forest as much as I did, but it surpassed all my expectations. The book kept me on the edge from start to finish, with one intrigue after another, whether it was a surprising scientific revelation or a character-driven twist. The way the story unfolded was incredibly elaborate, with no lulls to slow down the momentum.

As someone who isn‚Äôt typically a sci-fi fan, I was amazed by how fascinating the concepts were, explained clearly without delving too deep into technicalities. While I can‚Äôt say if the science was fully accurate, the philosophical themes behind it definitely felt grounded and thought-provoking.

The author‚Äôs creativity and imagination deserve immense credit, and I especially enjoyed the narration style, which was full of sudden plot twists that constantly surprised me. And the ending? It was thrilling and deeply satisfying. This book is easily a five-star read for me‚Äîone of the most unforgettable books I‚Äôve had the joy of reading.

"Why isn't James A. Michener famous anymore? I picked up Hawaii thinking it was written by some little-known author that I hadn't heard of. I'm really enjoying it, so I googled Michener to find out more about him. He was VERY famous a generation or two ago! I'm shocked that he wasn't on my radar. I asked some book friends, and they hadn't heard of him either. 

Why do you think that is? Is there something about his style that's out of vogue? Or was he eclipsed by writers like Ken Follett? Or is this just what happens to most bestselling authors?",normal

"Blood Meridian - this was an insanely interesting and disturbing ride  Well, I finally got to reading Blood Meridian! I know this book is quite popular now, and so praising it in a book subreddit may seem clich√©, but it's been a while since I've read a book that was this fascinating. After reading this, I'll definitely be looking at more Cormac McCarthy novels (The Road is probably what I'll read next)!

The atmosphere of this book is amazingly built in my opinion. The book makes use of its lengthy descriptions of landscapes to create these bizarre, lonely, and bleak environments. It really helps with the feeling of unease and the feeling that something bad is going to happen soon throughout the novel.

Easily my favorite thing about the book though is the main antagonist, The Judge, also known as Judge Holden. This ""man"" is maybe my new favorite antagonist in all of fiction. Everything about him is so chilling. From his bleak nihilistic worldview, to his random disturbing acts of sadistic violence and depravity, he constantly scared me whenever he appeared because wherever he goes, death and violence ensues. I personally feel he's even scarier than Anton Chigurh, which says a lot.

Also obviously I have to mention the extreme violence because, well, it's Blood Meridian. Some of this was really gut-wrenching stuff. I knew it was a violent Western novel, but I didn't expect material like all the violence against children and animals. Most of the violence, though by no means constant, was really disturbing and tough to read, largely because of the vivid detailed descriptions. However, it didn't really feel like shock value to me, largely because of the general evil of all the characters, and the fact that they're all scalphunters. Still, it was very shocking and stomach-churning at points. 

I'm not here to really give much of a review, but I just wanted to highlight the major points of the book that stood out to me. What were your thoughts on this novel, good or bad? I'd be happy to hear it all!",normal
"Have you ever lied about having read a book? Alternatively, have people ever accused you of not having read a book? I interact with a few booklovers who are kind of pushy, like they insist on me reading books that they recommend. Most recently, James, by Percival Everett. I've tried to get out of these situations a few times politely but they seemed offended, as if I don't respect them or their opinion. They know i'm not busy but don't understand I'm not as disciplined and productive as they are. Like I'm not always motivated to read. Sometimes I rather watch an old sitcom.

Anyhow so on a couple of occasions I've lied and said I did read the book. To back up my claim, I looked up details summaries of said books. I feel bad but can't find a better solution to it.

I've also had the opposite experience, where I say I read a particular book but people don't believe me. The problem is I don't have a good memory so I can only remember details of a book I've read in the last few weeks. Then I forget.

For example, a friend who just read Pride and Prejudice asked me what I thought of George Wickham, but I just couldn't remember who he was. At the time we had that conversation, I had read the book a year ago (for the second time in fact) but embarrassingly couldn't remember several important characters and their stories, other than important parts of what happened between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy (what was his first name?).

Anybody else relate or am I alone in this?",normal

"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue might genuinely be the best novel I've read in my life. Not really much to say about it. The main character makes a deal with a primordial god which condemns her to not just immortality, but to never be remembered by anyone.

"Long or Short Chapters? The lastest book that I read was a few pages shy of 300 so it was a quick read book not too long. It had 64 chapters though not even a 100 pages in you were already on chapter 21. 

I'm not a fan of a new chapter every few pages. For me a short chapter should be like 10-12 pages at the max and like 6 or 5 for the miminum. I don't want to start a chapter only to turn the page and have it be done and over with already. But I also don't want a 400/500 page book to have only 20 chapters in it and each chapter be 40 pages long etc.

Do you like short or long chapters or do do prefer a mix of them?

"GoodReads putting spoilers for the book I‚Äôm currently reading on my homepage Okay I feel so thoroughly annoyed right now. I am currently reading Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier for the first time, and really enjoying it. I‚Äôm at about 120 pages now, so approximately a quarter of the way through.  
This morning I logged on to GoodReads out of habit, just to check out some recommendations and stuff, and there‚Äôs always a little window right on the homepage with a single recommendation based on the book you‚Äôre currently reading.
This time it was what appears to be a fanfiction based on Rebecca, titled Mrs. De Winter, and the tiny blurb immediately below (which I wish I would‚Äôve kept my eyes away from), read something along the lines of ‚ÄúRebecca is Daphne du Maurier‚Äôs most well-known novel, which left many readers wondering ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù >!From the fire-wrecked remains of Manderley‚Ä¶‚Äù!<.

"The Will of the Many by James Islington - the best book I've read this year? Just finished The Will of the Many and honestly, I‚Äôm blown away by how unexpectedly amazing this book was. I tried the author's Licanus Trilogy and didnt really get into it as it seemed to reliant on secrets and plot twists and was kinda YA structured.

I am *very* weary of hyped up books beacuse they usually dont live up to it but damn, just... Damn. This book delivered it.

Sure, it leans into a couple of classic academia tropes‚Äîlike the skinny smart friend and the big burly silent friend, and the classic ""this teacher doesn‚Äôt like me"". Plus, Vis is basically the smartest guy on the planet and would give Kvothe, Son of Arliden a run for his money but overall, the book is incredible, and I couldn‚Äôt put it down.

One thing I wish they explored more was the concept of Will. The author give us the theory and all, but I wanted more scenes actually showing how it‚Äôs used in practice - it seems weird that future sentaros with insane amounts of Will dont learn how to use it.

Some plottwists did surprise me and I had to double back to make sure I've read something correctly but I also did see a few from a mile away - which, mind you is *not* a bad thing, I have just read so many books that a few things can surprise me anymore.

Despite those few flaws, the ending was ridiculously good, and that cliffhanger abrupt ending? Insanely well done. A certain death made me actually whince and I felt soo bad about it.

Can't wait to see where this series goes. 5/5 stars!",normal
"Return of the gentleman serial killer: Thomas Harris's ""Hannibal"". Tonight I've got through the third book of the Hannibal series for tonight. And it is one of the most polarizing of the four. Some like it, some don't.

It has been seven years since Dr. Hannibal Lecter had escaped from custody. And during those seven years he's been at large he has been savoring the scents and essences of a world that is unguarded.

But now Dr. Lecter's sanctuary has been entered by intruders. And they have now pierced his new identity and have sensed the evil that surrounds him.

Now he is hunted by multimillionaire that he had maimed, a corrupt Italian officer, and FBI agent Clarice Starling who was never the same when she first encountered the insane serial killer. And all of them want to find him, each in their own way. But there will be only one who will live long enough to savor the reward.

Now this one is much longer than the last two that I've read. The first book was about 400+ pages while the second was 300+ pages. So a much slower burn than the other two, with a bit more of a thriller feel to it, but still is really fine.

The book is polarizing mostly because of how it ends and some fans of the series don't really like it. I'll admit the ending is jarring but still I found ""Hannibal"" to be a great third entry in the whole. Maybe not the best as the first two books but still great anyways. Now it's on  to the fourth and final book, and after that something a little different.",normal

"Books changing covers/different covers for different formats I read Sweet Collide by Ava Harrison when it first came out in the beginning of the year. I loved it and I was happy when she got signed to a publishing company but O didn't like when they released with a new cover for the book. The book to me looks like a ya high school romance book now instead of characters in their twenties. 
Plus it has a second book coming out soon I think and you know its going to match the new cover but it stinks for the people who brought the original cover. 

Another author that I read had a beautiful landscape cover for the first book of her series but it got changed right before the second book came out and she announced the only way to get that cover was to go on her website since she's a self published author. 

Am I the only one that gets annoyed when that happens? Or does it not bother you at all? I like my series covers to match and go well together. I don't want to have a ton of different covers that don't match.

What's with some books having a different cover for every type of format it's published in? It's like a different cover for kindle, paper, hardcover etc. I understand discreet covers for spicy books that makes sense having two different covers. What I don't get is one book getting 3 different when it's released. It's like the author announces their new book then the blurb then 3 different covers it will be available in. Or a store special edition that you get this cover only if you buy from the store?

Do you think it's overdone a book having so many covers? Do you buy the same book but different cover? What do you think of the movie covers of books when they are made into a movie? ",normal
"How would Bret Easton Ellis‚Äôs novel American Psycho The other day a book titled Haunting Adeline popped up on my IG feed and some comments were praising it, so I decided check out the reviews on GoodReads. 


The reviews are all over the place, but I noticed a number of them saying how ‚Äútriggering‚Äù the book was. Apparently a character repeatedly rapes another character and the reviewers were shocked. (Which they have every right to be). I‚Äôm in no way passing judgement on anyones personal reactions. That‚Äôs not what my post is about. 


But it got me thinking about Bret Easton Ellis‚Äôs novel American Psycho. The book not the movie. 

I first read American Psycho in ‚Äò93 when I was 23 and I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was reading. I‚Äôm sure today there are equal or even crazier books on the market but at the time horror novels for the most part had a certain look and feel to them. Think Stephen King, James Herbert, Richard Laymon paperbacks etc. you know what I‚Äôm talking about. 


Anyhow American Psycho came in a trade paperback format looking like a perfectly respectable piece of literature lol. But holy shit. At the time it was the craziest thing I have ever read. If you‚Äôve read it you know what I‚Äôm taking about. The book makes the movies feel like a children‚Äôs nursery rhyme. 


So I‚Äôm just wondering if it was published today with the internet being what it is, and with sites dedicated to book reviews what would the reaction be? Would it have even made it to print? 


Maybe I‚Äôm just naive and there have always been books with that same type of explicit material. ",normal
"What Book/Series Lives Rent Free in Your Head (But in a good way)? As the title says, I want to hear about the book that lives in your head, rent free, and  you are happy that it is there to keep you company. Is it the first chapter book that turned you into a reader? Some book a friend gave you that opened up your world? One that was just really weird, but in a fun way?

Mine is Sara Douglass' *Wayfarer Redemption* trilogy (only books 1-3, I bailed on book 4 for REASONS)

"Reading my first John Updike, kinda skeeved out by it. I‚Äôve never read any John Updike before, but I have read a ton of what I would consider ‚Äúdude lit,‚Äù even though I‚Äôm a straight woman. I love Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, Philip Roth, Don Delillo, Bret Easton Ellis, etc. But this John Updike guy? I just don‚Äôt know about him. 

I‚Äôm reading The Villages, which maybe isn‚Äôt a great place to start, but I just really don‚Äôt like how Updike writes about women and sex. It‚Äôs like he has no empathy for his female characters, at all, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre just sex-puppets to him. And this is coming from someone who loves Bret Easton Ellis! Who has sawed his female characters in half! Hemingway, who has knocked up several poor long-suffering nurses and abandoned them! Steinbeck, who has given us so many drunken louts who let down the women in their lives. 

I don‚Äôt know why Updike‚Äôs suburban, milquetoast misogyny bothers me so much! I guess it‚Äôs this pervasive belief that his characters seem to have that women are so ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù so ‚Äúexotic and unknowable.‚Äù It‚Äôs like, they are just women, like, half the people on the planet, like your own mom and sister. Why does he write about them like they are another species? 

I was going to read Rabbit, Run, but now I‚Äôm just too skeeved out. Does it handle its female characters well? Is it worth reading? Thanks! ",normal
"How many themes should a book have before you‚Äôre trying to discuss too much? I know this is subjective and there‚Äôs no set answer but I just want to hear opinions. I‚Äôm writing a book and my strategy is coming up with a basic plot summary first then asking what themes I could explore there and which ones I actually care about or have enoigu to say about. I think one big problem with writing nowadays is writers with too much on their
minds and I‚Äôm generally someone who thinks less is more. But where do you think most books become too specific in their themes or too broad?",normal
"Malazan I‚Äôm currently on ‚ÄúDust of Dreams‚Äù by Erikson (book 9 of 10), and I‚Äôve been really enjoying the series. I‚Äôm both looking forward to finishing, and not wanting it to end.

I thought at the end of the series, I wouldn‚Äôt have to learn about and try to digest the implications and POVs of brand new characters, but boy was I wrong. Erikson is such a unique writer and I love it. ",normal
"Invisible Monsters (Palahniuk) - LGBTQ+ Opinions Just finished *Invisible Monsters* (1999) and am curious about it's reception by queer folk, both upon release and now in retrospect. Without giving spoilers, much of the plot and character development hinge on trans identities. I liked it for the interesting way Palahniuk uses tone to set really complex moods, but I also can see how various characters could be considered negative stereotypes of trans people. On the other hand, despite some of the caricatures and general outlandish-ness, the characters felt sympathetic and detailed way beyond just being a tool for humor (even though parts were very funny). 

Any trans or queer folk have opinions they'd like to share? Is it harmful and I missed the negativity?",normal

"I am currently reading Shuggie Bain and I really like it!  So, I started reading Shuggie Bain at the end of September. It's a book that I have seen numerous times on bookstagram and reddit and since the plot sounded intriguing, I decided to give it a try. 

Truth be said, this is not the type of book that I binge-read in one sitting. Because of its bleak atmosphere and dense writing, I take break in-between and there are days when I don't read it a lot. That being said, I love the writing a lot, I feel like the author has portrayed perfectly the sceneries, the places and the characters and for a debut novel, the book is well-written. 

The characters are so interesting and I really feel a sort of connection with Agnes and Shuggie. I really pity them and I wish the best for them. I was actually surprised to see that the book follows Agnes a lot, I had assumed that the narration would be focused on Shuggie, like it did in the first part. However, I do not complain because by doing so, it allows the reader to connect more with Agnes and observe Shuggie's background better. 

I am very interested to hear your opinion about the book (WITHOUT SPOILERS PLEASE). I am hopeful that I'll end up loving it. I am currently halfway through it and so far, it's a solid 4-5 stars read. I can't wait to see what happens next. ",normal
"Waiting till all the books in a series are out before reading it I've noticed with most of the series I have and have read or currently reading that I never discovered the series with the first book most of them I discovered when the first two or three books of the series were out already. The series was already in motion and I then just went into the series from there. I've never waited till the series was done and all the books were out so I could read it all at once mostly due to the fact that most of my series the author doesn't have a set number of books planned for the series so I never know when it will be finished. Yes waiting for the next book of the series to come out is at least to me hard depending on the series the author and how the book was left off. But if I don't know how many books is planned for the series I don't think I could do it could be years before I could read the series if the author takes about a year to publish each book.  

Do you wait till all the books in a series are out or do you read series as the books come out?",normal
"Who is your favorite dramatist and why?  I have always felt that drama is a genre gets sidelined in the literature field. While drama/ theatre in performance is usually a case of intrigue to people, drama on paper; in terms of writing doesn‚Äôt get enough acknowledgement.

if you were given a chance to research or know more about any works of a dramatist, who would you choose and why?",normal
"How long do you wait for the next book in the series? I've noticed with some of the new authors I'm reading that there's different ranges of when the next book of the series between them. Some are popping out books as soon as 3 months after the first book is published. Some are 6-7 months and others are a year between books. Growing up reading Rick Riordan I hated having to wait a whole year for the next book to come out because I would read them so quick. But as I got older while reading them I knew I was getting the best quality of storytelling in the book in the time it took to be written.

It seems like some authors today the first book of the series isn't even out yet before they are making a post of how they are working on book 2 and then you blink and they are promoting book 2 when book 1 hasn't even been out that long.  If the author and series is good and keeps me hooked then 6/7 months and even a year between books isn't bad for me. But I'm 50/50 about books that come out so quick it's like is this going to be the author's best work on this book.

How soon do you like having the next book in the series published? How long do you wait for the next book before you forget about it and loose interest? If it goes past a year would you even read it or be like I'm done with the series it's taking to long for the books to come out? What do you think is the perfect time frame for time between books in a series for it to live up to the book before or be better?",normal

2) Books set in Russia during the Soviet era

3) Hiking. If the story centers around a hike, I am more inclined to try reading it. ",normal
"ü¶áüéÉSpooky Season Is Upon Us!! What Are Your Reading Plans?üéÉüëª It's October 1st and Spooky Season has officially begun! Every year since 2017, I have made a tradition of planning my Spooktober reads several months in advance. Usually the books are a mix of horror and gothic fiction, with the occasional seasonally appropriate mystery. I often like to get an anthology of traditional horror/gothic/ghost short stories in there as well. 

I find it exciting to plan and go hunting for spooky books in the lead up. The anticipation as Fall draws near is such a rush! And now here we are, Spooktober is here!

My Spooktober 2024 Reads:

- **The Elementals by Michael McDowell (1981)** - I started my spooky reads a little early, actually, and read this in the last week of September. I just finished it last night. It's a short southern gothic haunted house novel. I really enjoy a good haunted house story, so I've had this recommended to me a lot of the years. Decided to finally give it a go, though it wasn't *quite* what I was hoping for. It was still a good read though and definitely a talented author when it comes to creating an uncanny atmosphere. I will probably reread it at some point because I think part of the problem was my own mindset.

- **Clown in a Cornfield 2 - Frendo Lives by Adam Cesare (2022)** - Just started this and expecting good fun! Read and enjoyed the first book last spooky season.

- **The Carrow Haunt by Darcy Coates (2018)** - another haunted house book. I've read her Haunting of Ashburn House and From Below in previous years. Really liked Haunting of Ashburn House so thought I'd try another haunted house book by her. This one is about a house haunted by the ghost of a serial killer, from what I understand.

- **Roald Dahl's Book of Ghost Stories (1983)** - this is my traditional horror short story collection for this season. It's a collection of Roald Dahl's favourite ghost/gothic stories by 19th/early 20th century authors. Includes some greats like A.M. Burrage, E.F. Benson, Edith Wharton, and Robert Aikman.

- **The Haunted by Bentley Little (2012)** - hadn't originally planned to read this but was an impulse buy when I was more recently browsing at a local bookstore.

- **The Monk by Matthew Lewis (1796)** - this is my traditional gothic novel for the season (usually always at least one). I've been meaning to read it for a while now so excited to finally get to it. 

- Potentially **The Haar by David Sodergren** - even though its high on my list, depends if I end up pulling the trigger on buying it or just going with stuff I've already got at home.

- Potentially **Pine by Francine Toon** - Scottish folk/gothic horror I've been wanting to read for a while. I do have it at home, but kind of depends on whether I end up grabbing the Haar or not, just as far as having time to read all of these this month.

- Potentially **Darkness by John Saul** - a back up if I have more time to read more books than expected this month.

- Potentially **The Gathering by C.J. Tudor** - another back up

**How about you guys?! What are you planning to read for Spooky Season this year??**",normal
"Have you ever found a real gem in one of those public free book shelves/book trading places? I just need to share this with you all since everyone here is so enthusiastic about books as well and my friends are already rolling their eyes at me, but i got really lucky last week. 
I'm currently on a cruise around Norway and when we were visiting the tourist information in the rather small town Kristiansand, there was a shelves of books for everyone to take as they please, and what do I find there between a hundred Norwegian novels? The Norton Anthology on English Literature, in English. Maybe a month ago I asked on reddit for recommendations of a collection of different Romantic poets, and as luck would have it, I find the most popular rec in one of the unlikeliest places ever. and it's in peak condition! Not too long ago, I also got Les Miserables, an edition from the 80s, in one of those telephone booths turned into book shelf, where you can take one and leave one of your own there

"The Husbands by Holly Gramazio Just finished this book and loved it so much.  
As a single woman, it felt so relevant.  That feeling of flipping through options on dating apps, getting turned off by one weird little thing, wondering if you're settling, if there's something better out there if you keep trying, getting stuck on one person and thinking if you could just be with them everything would be perfect.
And I loved the end. >!When Lauren finally makes the decision to just choose to love someone and make a life with him.  Isn't that what relationships are? Just being willing to acknowledge that there's no perfect person but there might be someone wonderful who you can be happy with, if you can just settle down and do the work. !<

Just a really great commentary on relationships, woven inside a very entertaining story (Zach Ephron!) I'm interested to hear what others thought of it.",normal

"The Myth Of Sisyphus. Albert Camus. I became aware of this book recently after reading Steven Fry's books Mythos and Heros, I thought it was going to be a more in depth telling of the Greek story of Sisyphus, OH BOY, was I wrong.

A book on self awareness and philosophy, basically examining the way we see ourselves, our life and our situation.

Very much what I'd call an intellectual read, not for the faint hearted.

It does go into some detail and explanation of the legend, but more in reference to his mindset rather than a literary telling of the story.

Glad I read it?  Yes.

Did I enjoy it?  Not so much enjoy, but enlightening.

Recommend it as a good read?  Probably not for everyone.",normal
"In memory of Pete Rose:  ""Ball Four,"" by Jim Bouton (1970) Pete Rose, who died yesterday, is best remembered in some parts for his succinct review of *Ball Four,* one of the best sports books ever written:  *Fuck you, Shakespeare*, delivered personally from the Reds dugout while Bouton was pitching for the opposing team.

After the success of [Ball Four](https://archive.org/details/ballfourmylifeha00bout)*,* Bouton wrote a follow-up best-seller, ¬†[I'm Glad You Didn't Take It Personall](https://archive.org/details/imgladyoudidntta0000jimb)*y*.   I've linked to two of the many copies that can be borrowed from the Internet Archive.

Jim Bouton died in 2019.  He donated some [37,000 papers](https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchCode=LCCN&searchArg=mm2018086270&searchType=1&permalink=y&loclr=blogloc) and other items to the Library of Congress:  [https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2019/07/new-baseballs-jim-bouton-and-ball-four-at-the-library/](https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2019/07/new-baseballs-jim-bouton-and-ball-four-at-the-library/)

Rose was banned from baseball (and eligibility for the Hall of Fame) for life for gambling, and later convicted of tax evasion.",normal

"Anyone notice how many literary accolades India has in english? I'm just curious about correlation and causation. Im currently listening to my first Salman rushdie book (midnights children) and have been physically reading shantaram, both of which revolve around bombay. It's very curious when the book I read earlier (the secret history) had references to rushdie as a legend. Also, last but not least, a podcast (the English history podcast) describes English as having proto indo European origins. These same origins are said to have evolved into sanskrit (among many others) which is one of indias many languages. I know that's a lot, and I'm naive so bare with me, but do you think some of this translates into native Indians dialect as more alluring for other English speakers? Any examples of good metaphors or related material are welcome. It's a fascinating story and any hunches or conspiracy would be welcome too!",normal
"Why isn‚Äôt there more analysis of mental illness in Neuromancer? I‚Äôve been thinking about how mental illness is portrayed in Neuromancer and was surprised to find very little analysis or discussion about it in google scholar. It seems like there‚Äôs a lot to unpack, especially with characters like Armitage, Case, and Riviera, who all seem to suffer from significant mental health issues. For example, Armitage‚Äôs psychological instability, Case‚Äôs drug addiction and self-destructive tendencies, and Riviera‚Äôs disturbing behavior could all be explored in greater depth.

EditÔºö

So, I'm wondering why no papers delve deeply into the depiction of mental illness in this book. Is it because the worldview of cyberpunk is not compatible with contemporary psychoanalytic theories? But since William Gibson is a modern author, his novels should be analyzable using modern methodologies.

What do you think about this situation? Or, if you have any insights into the mental issues in the novel, feel free to share them.",normal
"When do you decide that you're just done with an author? When I read the Bookshop on the Corner by Jenny Colgan I totally loved it  Other books by her that involved reading/books in the plot I have loved to. But any other work by her that doesn't involved that it just seems to be horrible writing wise, plot wise, characters etc it's like they are not even written by the same author. I've given her the benefit of the doubt with some of the books I've read. But it seems each one is worse than the last. After the latest book of hers that I read I really think I have to call it quits with her. Her work is too inconsistent and I'm getting more and more frustrated when reading her books. 

Usually I can tell within a book or two if I don't like an author's writing style or just don't think they're a good writer. But with her I went thru at least 5 good books before the downfall started.  How many books of an author will you read before you decide that they're just not the author for you? What do you do when you have read them for a certain amount of time and then their work becomes inconsistent leaning towards more the not so good side? ",normal
"Somewhere Beyond the Sea by TJ Klune  I could count on one hand the number I‚Äôve books I regret reading. Actually I think it‚Äôs only two. The Troop by Nick Cutter, and Somewhere Beyond the Sea (SBTS). 

The House in the Cerulean Sea is my favorite book. I listen to it when I‚Äôm stressed out because it makes me so happy. I adore the characters. It‚Äôs not perfect and it definitely has its moments that I feel are too corny and unrealistic, and he really beats you over the head with the moral, but I like the book. I was so excited for SBTS, especially bc I‚Äôm obsessed with Arthur Parnassas (is that how it‚Äôs spelled? I read the audiobook. Anyway). 

I liked the beginning of the book. Arthur‚Äôs trial was exciting and dramatic, and it was nice to have some time between just Linus and Arthur without the kids. I even liked when they picked up David, even though I thought he was a little annoying and unnecessary, because I liked seeing the way Arthur interacted with him. 

But as the book went on after Mrs. Marblemaw showed up, it was just so hard to keep going. The reader of the audiobook has been good in the past, but I kept having to turn down the volume bc I was embarrassed by the melodramatic reading. I can live with a bit of overacting on the dialogue, but being so loud and dramatic on narrative lines is just unnecessary and uncomfortable. It constantly took me out of the story. 

Not that I was really dying to be in the story, because the story itself wasn‚Äôt great either. Every time the kids talked to Arthur and Linus they were giving some kind of profound statement or lecture to their dads. I thought Arthur must be dehydrated from all the times he cried or teared up at some beautiful thing they said. Enough! It‚Äôs not poignant anymore after 50 times. Can they just be normal for five seconds? I get that Sal is mature for his age, and I can appreciate that. But there‚Äôs only so many times a 15 year old can know more than his parents before I start to roll my eyes. Lucy was funny though, he always is. 

The plot was all over the place. What is the deal with the mud people? That was so out of nowhere and weird. Zoe being a queen all of a sudden was preposterous. If she was the queen, why didn‚Äôt she do anything before? She just figured out now that she shouldn‚Äôt let the government try to take away Arthur‚Äôs children? And she never helped Arthur when he was being beaten and locked in a cellar, but no one ever gives her shit for that. But Arthur can demand of Linus ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you help the other kids you met before us?‚Äù If I were Linus I wouldn‚Äôt have just accepted that bs. 

I think the worst for me is the corniness. The townspeople all got together and clapped for the kids no less than twice, probably more. It was literally the ‚Äúand then everyone clapped‚Äù meme, except it was supposed to be in earnest. And J Bone is *such* a caricature. Why does he keeping coming into the story? I can‚Äôt take it.

And Mrs. Marblemaw and Mrs. Rowder were so one dimensional, even when you thought they might not be. Like there were hints that Marblemaw might turn into a decent person, but that just went away and wasn‚Äôt acknowledged. And Mrs. Rowder actually made some decent points (like, can we seriously acknowledge that Lucy being the antichrist is worth discussing? And she‚Äôs right, she *wasnt* alive for what happened to Zoe so why is Zoe blaming her for it), but there was no engagement with those ideas. We were just supposed to figure ah whatever she‚Äôs evil, let‚Äôs move on. 

And I wanted more passion with Linus and Arthur. I know the books don‚Äôt have sex scenes and that‚Äôs fine. But what about some fighting, or making out, or sexual innuendo? I didn‚Äôt think it was supposed to be YA but maybe it was. I just wanted a little something more from them than acting like they‚Äôve been married for 50 years and only care about their kids. 

Ok thank goodness I got that off my chest. ",normal
"What books are you saving to read because you know you'll love them.  I love Thomas Hardy and have read about half of his novels. The other half are sitting on my bookshelf.

"I get annoyed when every chapter is a different characters perspective I just find it so jarring to change gears so abruptly every chapter. I'll be getting swept away in an exciting part of the story and then BAM now we're following Gerald at the airport. I just finished God Of The Woods (it was fine) but not only did it change characters every chapter, it also jumped between 5 different timelines. It was so fatiguing that I almost put it down a few times.   
On a brighter note, I also read Will Of The Many about a month ago which is a true linear story and it was so refreshing. Each chapter picked up right where the last one left off and i just had a blast reading it. ",normal
"Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah‚Äôs Chain-Gang All Stars: A Dystopian Look at Power, Freedom, and Humanity Has anyone read *Chain-Gang All Stars* by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah?¬† I found the book to be absolutely incredible and thought-provoking. I got the chance to talk with the author as well which was really fun. Got to understand his writing process and ask questions about some of the themes in the book.

This novel is a powerful dystopian tale about freedom, survival, and resistance. It about how Prisoners can reduce their sentence to 3 years if they compete in fight to the death combat sport.

In many ways, it evokes the themes of the *13th* documentary by Ava DuVernay, *The New Jim Crow* by Michelle Alexander, and the film *Sorry to Bother You* by Boots Riley‚Äîoffering a raw exploration of systemic violence and societal exploitation.

I wanted to share some of my thoughts & I had questions:

**1. The Weight of Freedom:** Loretta Thurwar, the protagonist, is the closest to freedom anyone‚Äôs been in the CAPE program. But this path to freedom isn‚Äôt a straight line‚Äîit‚Äôs built on death, pain, and sacrifice. How far will you go for liberation, especially when it‚Äôs designed to be nearly impossible to reach?

**2. The Power Dynamic of Sport:** The spectacle of ‚ÄúChain-Gang‚Äù is a chilling reflection of how society consumes violence. With chains ranked from Rookie to Colossal, each ""Link"" fights for their life while the world watches. Does this sound far-fetched, or could it be a disturbing future reality for entertainment?

**3. The Cost of Survival:** Thurwar and Staxxx are both forced to navigate the complexities of survival in a system that pits people against each other. The characters show us that sometimes, survival means making choices that will haunt you forever.

**4. The Dehumanization of Prisoners:** The CAPE program strips prisoners of their humanity, reducing them to mere ‚ÄúLinks‚Äù in a chain. The use of ""Bloodpoints"" and the merchandising of their likenesses reflect how these characters are exploited and commodified. This is eerily similar to the privatization of prisons in our world, where profit often outweighs human life.

*Chain-Gang All Stars* is not just a dystopian novel‚Äîit‚Äôs a mirror reflecting how we engage with power, entertainment, and the humanity of those behind bars.

For those that read it, What did you think about the book? Curious to talk to people about it",normal
"Animal Farm by George Orwell (Book Review) Animal Farm by George Orwell is a striking satirical novel that mocks the central idea of an authoritative regime and displays the hypocrisy and cruelty lined by the ones in power, the formation of a totalitarian authority and the horrors faced by the innocent souls layered within naivety and blinding belief. This is a novel where we follow the animals of a farm, how they discuss on starting a rebellion and acting against it to overthrow the tyrannical corruption of the humans and whole of humanity.  
  
As the rebellion starts and the animals presumably win over; we can see what becomes their living life next. Overthrowing the owner of the farm, are the animals now truly free? Is this independence that that they sought for such long? Is this their true victory? As the novel progresses, we can see the horrifying realities that is faced by the animals. As the ones gain power, sooner or later things start to stir up. We can see how the satire of this book lays upon infront of our eyes.  
  
Giving a body the right to leadership and then being ruled by it, is it true freedom? As we see in the real world, how tyrannical and fascist governments tend to be and in many instances are there a layered segmented body of totalitarian authority and how as the governing body gains power, the realities of the civilians and the normal working class people gets ruled over by corruption and the greed that nests over the governing body. The lust for more as ones perception of humanity and morality descends into treachery and tyranny. How can one turn out to be the victims of discrimination and prejudiced and labelled ""lowly"" due to factors that no one can change; disparity between race and how this affects the perception of ""equality"" within the body of many different races (species of animals, context) and maps out their lives for till the moment they halt their breath.  
  
This novel excellently mocks the world in which we are living in today. Overthrowing the government and letting a new party take over, do you call this independence? Being blinded by the ones in power even when you do know the reality and the truth, brainwashed to a point where the fabricated and layered statement full of faulty and flawed information are fed to you as the truth. Overconsumption and willing to stay blinded and letting your life being dictated and ruled by the fascist authority, all while you being patriotic and devoted to the higher ups. Don't you think this is familiar? This is the reality of the world we live in and the nuanced complexity of Animal Farm portrayed this magnificently throughout the course of the fate and lives of the animals.  
  
Corruption, cruelty and dictatorship. As one received the throne of power; they became the sole thing they swore to destroy : corruption and the tyrannical oppressor. How the cycle of revolution comes to be when it is completed. Back to before but even worse. This story also displays the naivety and innocence of the regular normal civilians and how they are played by the crooked and heinous authority. The revolution of the animals to gain freedom? Or to be back in the same state yet again but blinded and fed with untrue virtues of kindness and morality??  
  
This story also displays the immense and striking effect caused by a strong speech from a political figure. How in doing so a normal person would likely gravitate into following the speakers words and trusting those by heart. How words and speeches play a major role in the formation and destruction of a community and an authority. Even when you know the reality, if you are to speak, your fate will be doomed, the petrifying nature of totalitarianism and an authority with utmost power, layered by corrupted views of greed and lust. The political commentary is a work of art, portrayed realistically with utmost nuance and complexity.  
  
The story itself is very accessible, I was to be frank stunned how easy this was to read and understand. Displaying the horrors and torments of our unfair lives in a cartoonish and funny way while diving through the depths of the mind that is layered in deception, betrayal and doctoring. What else is there to be said about this excellent piece of fiction that depicts the reality in such striking lens? Masterful work by the author and it truly is well worthy and known for its worldwide popularity. Truly a classic fable that deserves all the praise, it is probably the book I tabbed and annotated the most. I can't help but think of 1984, how will that turn out to be? I own the book and this one was probably the best start for delving into the world of Orwellian fiction. Genuinely loved the book and its overall commentary. There are very few quotes worthy of mentioning as you have to decipher the meaning yourself, but here are 2 which stood out to me quite prominently:  
  
***‚Äú It had become usual to give Napoleon the Credit for every Successful achievement and every stroke of good fortune. You would often hear one hen remark to another, ‚ÄúUnder the guidance of our leader, Comrade Napoleon, I have laid five eggs in six days‚Äù or two cows, enjoying a drink at the pool, would exclaim, 'thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon, how excellent this water tastes!' ""***  
  
***""They had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes.""***  
  
To understand the striking intensity and the depths of these quotes, you have to read the story yourself first. Which I highly recommend you to do so. And ofcourse, the infamous quote that sums up the entirety of Animal Farm:  
  
***‚ÄúAll animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.‚Äù***  
  
Excellent book with utmost insights and significance.

"Have you read a review of a book that was just really funny? Sometimes the world can get a bit depressing, so let's talk about some funny reviews you've seen!

Have you ever read a review that just made you laugh, even if the book was a serious one? Maybe the book itself was funny and the reviewer simply matched that energy in their review, or the book was really bad and the reviewer burned it to the ground in a funny way, or maybe the review mentioned aspects of the book that made you think: 'Did we even read the same book?'

The review that resulted in this post was from that last category. For context, on Storygraph, reviewers can add content warnings for the book to their reviews, and readers can see these warnings along with how many people included a certain warning, and when multiple people have used the same warning, you know it's more than likely actually in the book, but I like seeking out the warnings that only one or two people have commented, usually things that aren't really in the book anyway, and I look up their comment to see their justification.

This particular content warning was on The Sunbearer Trials by Aiden Thomas, and the tag was 'sexism'. Now, I didn't think this book was sexist, like, at all. There is a lot of representation of different genders and sexes (the main character is a trans boy, there are multiple trans and non-binary characters, the women are always treated as equal to the men, personal stengths play a big part in the story and both men and women are have their own strengths and weaknesses) and I genuinely couldn't think of anything sexist happening in this book. So I checked out the comment this content warning came from, and no offense to the reviewer, but I thought it was really funny.

The reviewer said that they found the dialogue to be sexist, mostly because of the frequent usage of the word 'douche', which, according to them, cannot be used in a way that's not derogatory, and this ruined their enjoyment of the book. Again, they are entitled to their own opinions and feelings, their review just confused me, as I never thought of 'douche' being a sexist insult. I know the origin and I can see how it originally started out as sexist (men don't like being called something related to vagina's), but I think it has been seperated from its origin enough to not be considered sexist anymore, especially since it's more of a gender neutral insult now. And if I remember it correctly, the three people in the book who use this word the most are two trans boys and a girl, and they use it towards a boy, a girl, and a non-binary person. So in context it's definitly not intended to be sexist!

Anyway, I don't think this reviewer is wrong per se, but I just thought it was funny that they picked up on something that I would have never noticed. 

Are there any reviews like that you've read that were so different from your own reading experience that it just made you laugh? Or reviews that were funny for a different reason?",normal
"Once A Monster by Robert Dinsdale- Read this book if you like Charles dickens, Herman Hesse, and Neil Gaiman. I really, really loved this book.  I hesitated starting it because I was frustrated by the previous 2 Greek reimagining's I read, but this came highly recommended by a dear friend, so i jumped in.

The prose is really a delight, the plot is a joy to discover, the characters feel very deeply, it just hit all my sweet spots. 

Obviously given the setting, dickens sprang to mind (what with the Fagin parallel and the orphans and street kids), but very strongly was the spirit of Herman Hesse, that straightforward prose that strips the soul bare, it hit just right for me.  A touch of Gaiman's fantastic sense of wonder permeates the darkest moments, helping save it from becoming a depression triggering tale for me at least. 

I've never written a blurb like this and posted it.  I just really hope people read this book because I enjoyed it deeply.",normal
"Natsume S≈çseki A while ago I've read Botchan, Kokoro and Sanshir≈ç and I though I can't really remember them well, though I remember Kokoro rather well, I found them enjoyable to read but never really felt like writing about them on here.  But I only yesterday finished I am a Cat and I am very appreciative to have read that book.  I love his inclusion of other writings and teachings so the characters can make sense of the time they are forced to fill in their lives and I really enjoyed the cat who as of yet has no name and his minor conquests, or attempts at, in his own life.  I already knew the writer had a fun way to make his books fun to read but for some reason, I am a Cat was so fluid with its's story telling that the mixture of comedic and tragic worked to compliment each other so well that you didn't feel like they were interrupting one or the other.  I wish I could say more about the other three I read but I can't remember much of them, only that I enjoyed the writing.  

If anyone else has read his work, I'd love to know your thoughts.  ",normal

"Books that make you feel loved, as if getting a warm hug by the fire and are surrounded by caring people. I'd been going through a rough time and feeling invisible, alone, and alienated in a world of strangers who are just looking out for themselves.

Started looking around for books that make me feel good, and give me cozy feeling of like being loved by others and cared for. Didn't care if it'd be fiction, nonfiction, or however long, something that gives you hope and a sense that you matter to people and make you believe that life may be tough but kind people exist and can help.

Tried a couple of different types of books but wasn't able to get past the first few pages. They were either sugar-coated and dumbed down versions of reality or too self-helpy or just not to my taste.

Then I had a strange reaction to a book that is not usually considered a feel-good book: To Kill a Mockingbird. I don't know what it is, I mean like the Southern way of life, that sense of family, an intelligent and caring father who took the time to teach his children about life and important values like justice and compassion...something about it really warmed my heart. I still go back to it and feel the same warm feelings I did upon first reading it. Even though it deals with serious issues and has some unpleasant and ignorant characters too, reading it continues to be an emotional resource.

I continue my search for other books that I can go to at such difficult personal times, but I have now learned I might find them in places did not ever think to look.

Also I decided to also ask what books other people find that have similar effects.

P.S. In the meantime I've seen also a couple of other people online mentioning similar reactions to Harper's book so I'm not the only one I guess.",normal

"White by Bret Easton Ellis I have never encountered anything‚Äîany book or movie or series‚Äîthat has aged so badly and so fast as White by Bret Easton Ellis.

Ellis was one of my favorite writers, who frankly peaked at a very young age. There was the numbing Less Than Zero when he was a teenager, and then of course American Psycho which was absolutely brilliant and defining and somehow was written in his twenties.

He wrote some other pretty good novels and short stories as well, but his 21st century output just hasn‚Äôt been the same. Lunar Park and The Shards, which both star fictional versions of himself, are too self-centered to ever be considered classics.

Still, I thought I‚Äôd be a completist and check out his controversial nonfiction book of essays. I have to say, I wish I hadn't.

White really starts out so promising. Ellis spends a lot of time reviewing movies and music, especially from the 80s, which seems to be among his favorite topics. He says some interesting things about being queer as well, especially in the context of film and Hollywood's evolving norms. Most of all, the background on writing Less Than Zero and then American Psycho are excellent. Very much worth reading for fans. Even the backstory of the latter‚Äôs film and yes its musical adaptation are great reads. Plenty of celebrity name-dropping for good measure.

But that‚Äôs not really the point of White. The point of this book, is to complain about the kids these days.

He doesn‚Äôt use the word woke, which wasn‚Äôt quite in fashion yet, but it‚Äôs an incredibly familiar list of complaints. Couldn‚Äôt be more cliched.

Basically, 2017 and the subsequent years since then were an annoying time and some people went overboard. We all know. And yet, this was written right before 2020 when shit got so much more serious. And it could not have aged more badly.

His premise more or less is that the MAGA movement isn‚Äôt that bad, people complained too much about the president which annoyed him (the greatest sin there is apparently), and just generally trying to normalize that awful administration.

He devotes thousands and thousands of words to this. Having read a few political books in my time, what's frustrating is how much Ellis talks about ‚Äòaesthetics‚Äô without actually caring about the policy aspects of politics whatsoever. He doesn‚Äôt have anything to say about immigration, or women‚Äôs rights, or even gay marriage or anything like that. He seems to think presidents and governments don‚Äôt do much of anything, and so all the fears the winey libs had are overblown.

Wow this aged badly after January 6. Like, he reveals how his boyfriend is a Millennial and acts like he deserves points for that‚Äîwhich is kind of problematic with the age gap actually, since when was it progressive to be 20 years older than your partner, not that I really care. He calls him a member of Generation Wuss, and has nothing to say about substantial LGBTQ+ issues of which that administration was extremely hostile.

Sure, he makes the perfunctory statements how he‚Äôs not right-wing and didn't vote for that. But the both side-ism doesn‚Äôt work, when he uses almost all his energies to complain about ‚Äúthe left.‚Äù

He keeps saying he has friends who voted Republican, how amazingly diverse his social group is, but he never says why they voted that way. There's no real argument. Politics is all an abstraction which doesn‚Äôt apparently affect anyone in real life.

Ellis mocks the term, but there‚Äôs really not other way to say it but this: He‚Äôs incredibly privileged.

Who cares that dinner parties were awkward for him because people freaked out too much? So what? There were real human beings affected by family separations at the border, and the Muslim ban, the hurricane response in Puerto Rico, trying to overturn the ACA, etc., etc.

Not to mention COVID!

And since then, Roe vs. Wade has been overturned and Project 2025 is now a viable threat and democracy is being undermined and there's a host of other serious issues. Sorry, but it turned out that his hyperventilating friends were completely correct.

Remarkably, the book ends on a note with defending Kanye West of all people. It‚Äôs nuts reading this in 2024. Like the whole ‚Äúdragon energy‚Äù take Kanye had, it‚Äôs all about the vibe, and zero about how the government functions in a way would help anyone.

And then it gets worse. He says Kanye can‚Äôt support white supremacy if he's Black, and then he defends Candace Owens and Roseanne Barr. The worst examples you could come up with. Somehow he throws James Gunn in there, without mentioning or even understanding that Gunn‚Äôs cancel moment was a right-wing smear job, and of course a lot has happened since then with the director‚Äôs resurgence because it fundamentally wasn‚Äôt the same as those other bigoted celebrities who went off the deep end and have turned out to deserve every criticism.

Bret Easton Ellis has always been an incredibly talented writer, but he should never have gotten into politics. Especially this kind of petty grievances-style blogging.

He‚Äôs become exactly what he used to satirize.

Take this quote: ‚ÄúHowever, my socialist boyfriend, whom I often accused of liberal fascism, now believed that my obsession with aesthetics had become, by the summer of 2018, essentially fascist as well.‚Äù

So if you follow that, it‚Äôs so bad that his boyfriend believed Ellis essentially a fascist. Even though he accuses his boyfriend of being a liberal fascist in the same sentence.

Which is it? Is it lame overreacting to call anyone fascists, or is it that the libs are the real fascists and that makes it okay to call them fascists?

If you haven‚Äôt noticed, this writing actually isn‚Äôt any good at all‚Ä¶

Lastly, there‚Äôs this term ‚ÄòEmpire‚Äô and ‚ÄòPost-Empire‚Äô that Ellis is fond of. I simply don‚Äôt get what the point is ultimately, what's supposed to be so great about post-Empire. What he‚Äôs really talking about is being anti-establishment, but where‚Äôs the value of being contrarian for its own sake? He never explains. All these essays and he has nothing actually political to say in the sense that politics is about policies that effect the lives of millions. And the only thing that‚Äôs a big deal, in the end, is people on Twitter vaguely making him uncomfortable sometimes.

For Bret Easton Ellis, what really matters is but the surface-level, with nothing fundamentally there, an empty tirade all focused on only‚Ä¶ the aesthetics.",normal

"I like Winston Groom's ""Forrest Gump"". I decided to read this book after the film, because it was interesting what the film adaptation was based on.  And even though I liked the book, it's very different from the movie. At one point, jumping the shark actually happens. 

The story tells about the amazing life of a not very smart guy Forrest Gump. And with each chapter, his life becomes more and more absurd. 

In general, I was drawn into this story. It was interesting to read and think where Forrest's road would lead him next, what a very strange story he would get into. And if in the first half everything was within the norm, then in the second the author seems to be going crazy >!(the most normal moment in this half is when Gump becomes a chess champion)!< . And the book has humor... black humor, which made me laugh a lot, although there are serious moments here, for example, Gump's stay in Vietnam.

About Forrest Gump. I liked this character. He is such a bumpkin with a kind heart, but rude and feeble-minded, but still understands how life works.  

I liked the author's writing style. The book is written like this. It's like Forrest is communicating directly with you, so the text uses a conversational style of speech. And I like that Forrest makes spelling mistakes in some words, it highlights his dementia. And the text itself is easy to read.

As a result, I liked the book. She is interesting and funny, the main character is well made, and the author's writing style is good. It is very different from its adaptation, but it is still good.",normal
"White World, a Pakistani novel that visions a future where nothing ever changes. I wanted to share this because this book hit me deeply. I came across it at book fair. It brought to me memories of what my family went through in Pakistan. It has corruption, bigotry, and reminders that military rule is more the norm for my country. I found that I had to stop reading many times, but I kept on going because it is also a story of love and family. The writing is very good. If you like dystopian novels that have very complex characters, I recommend this.",normal

"Diary of a Wimpy Kid I just read the first book in the series and I wasn't expecting it to be as funny as it was. I was genuinely laughing out loud throughout. Don't get me wrong, the main character's behavior and outlook and the way that he treats people are abominable, and there's no way that I could recommend reading this to your kids - I think it'd set an awful example for how to treat people - but the writing's hilarious when you're reading it as an adult without kids to worry about.

For stuff like this, how does it become such a huge sensation (the series has sold over 290 million copies worldwide since the first book's release in 2007)? Do kids find the book on their own? And they think the way this character behaves is funny, or the way he thinks/situations he finds himself in are relatable, so they tell their friends about it? Or is it something where parents find it and read it to their kids because they think it's a good story about childhood and friendship and feeling like an outsider and reaping the consequences of the way we treat others and all that?

If you have it handy, I strongly suggest reading it. Again, I can't condone any of the main character's decisions or actions, but it won't take you more than a couple hours to read, and the writing really is laugh out loud funny.

**Edit:** /u/aubreythez/ compared this to The Simpsons, and that's given me a completely new understanding of/appreciation for the book and why kids love it, and how kids are able to differentiate between behavior they think is funny and behavior they actually emulate.",normal
"Animal farm I just read this for the first time, having read 1984 in high school.   And holy cow it's absolutely terrifying how like... it's all happening right now.   The doublethink and ""alternate facts"" already blew my mind a little but reading this it's like a playbook for crummy business/government/politicians and its happening right in front of our eyes.   Orwell was either a prophet or a keen observer of humanity, but I want to believe it has never been as blatant as it seems to be right now.  

It's super short, only like 140 pages, I advise everyone if you haven't yet to read it.  Hug your loved ones and make sure you do whatever you can to not let whatever your animal farm is to become the manor farm.  ",normal
"The Next Mrs. Parrish spoiler discussion So I read the first book ""The Last Mrs. Parrish"" years ago and I absolutely hated it, but I'd read other books by Liv Constantine that I enjoyed (The Wife Stalker), and I was hoping this one would redeem the ending of the first one a bit, so I gave it a chance.

I didn't read the prequel book ""The First Shot"" so when they introduced this plotline into the book with this Daisy Ann character I was a bit thrown for a loop since I had no idea who this character was. Thankfully, the book went into the backstory a bit to give us an understanding.

I felt this book, compared to the first created a lot of plotholes. At the end of the first book, Jackson terminates his parental rights and is arrested for tax evasion and his assets are taken. But then in this book, apparently being arrested for tax evasion isn't a big deal so he's able to keep his multi-million dollar mansion, yacht, luxury cars, etc. Okay. Then later, when Daphne gets framed for using drugs, he's given temporary emergency custody? I don't care how much money he bribed a judge, who would award custody to someone who voluntarily terminated their parental rights and was convicted of a crime and JUST got out of prison?

Even the characters we're supposed to root for (Daphne, Daisy Ann) were just even more unlikeable in this book. Daphne was just so stupid! ""Jackson was so evil and abusive, and I ran away from him for a reason. Oh, my bratty teenage daughter wants to see him. Should I tell her the truth of who her father really is? Nah, I'll just go bring my daughters back to him, he says he's changed after all! He was a bad husband but a good dad, I doubt he'll do anything!""

And the whole thing about Amber killing her first husband (Daisy Ann's father), it was originally ruled an accident, but Daisy Ann does some digging but comes up empty. Then suddenly out of nowhere she gets a call that they randomly found footage from someone that proves it wasn't an accident? Like, yeah, okay lol.

The subplots with the diamonds, the business dealings and the endless name brand mentions, I could easily do without, those are just boring.

I was glad to see Jackson finally get punishment that he deserves, although I don't know if I could wish that type of fate on anyone (locked-in syndrome), even someone as evil and sadistic as Jackson.

I also hated the ending of Amber getting bailed out by the same guy that beat Jackson up and it leaving on a cliffhanger. I hope we get a third book and hopefully Amber gets out of it, cause as awful as she is, she's such a fun villain imo. (Plus I just hate cliffhangers lol)

Overall, I'd say I liked it better than the first one mostly because I just HATE the first one's ending so much (""she's a mean bitch and a con artist so I'm gonna give my abusive husband to her"") without knowing Amber's backstory, so I liked that this one explored her backstory a bit more and that Amber got away from Jackson and Jackson got a fitting ending.",normal
"Streets of Laredo, the sequel to Lonesome Dove is also amazing! Thanks to this group I read Lonesome Dove a while ago, despite not usually liking westerns and loved it! To be honest I was dubious that any sequel could live up to it, especially with Gus, my favourite and easily the most likeale and charismatic character  gone. However, I loved LD so much I thought it would be rude to ignore the sequel and I have to say it supassed my expectations by a lot. Mybe it\`s a bit ""grimmer and sad"" than LD but that\`s not necesarry a bad thing IMHO!

The Captain Call ""on one last mission"" narrative was gripping and the host of new characters, notably Joey Garza, the cold blooded killer and his mother were well drawn complex but believable people. The themes of aging, legend, sexism, the preatory nature of men and life and death were all delt with in a subtle and engossing way. It was great, I read it really quickly and it was almost as good as Lonesome Dove, which is the highest of praise!",normal

"Recently read American Psycho and gave me nightmares. What was the most unsettling book you've read? American Psycho is about Patrick Bateman, who is an investment banker with a huge ego who may also have a, well, quite a disturbing and scary side to his personality. I don't want to say more but I suspect many of you are already familiar with this book through the movie adaptation which I saw first. I think the movie does a good job but, as shocking as the movie is in certain scenes, the book is actually way scarier and I highly recommend that you do not read it before going to bed! It gives you nightmares. Not kidding. And I'm not easily scared.

"When you like a certain book, but most people think it's bad. I'm wondering which book you liked, despite the fact that most people consider it bad or terrible. For me, this is  ""The Poppy War"" by R.F. Kuang. Yes, the fact that this book won the William Crawford Prize is very stupid, because the book has an uneven pace, cardboard (for the most part) characters, and the author's writing style is very dry and difficult to read (in a bad way). But I enjoyed it. The action was written quite well, Rin is currently an interesting character in terms of showing character degradation. And to some extent, it was interesting to read.

"Finished the Harry Potter series as a first time reader who has not seen the movies! I had the pretty cool opportunity to read the whole series without ever really being spoiled. I always thought the series was lame so I never cared for the pop culture surrounding it. 

I made a previous post about not liking Hermione when I was reading the books and that was I believe after finishing the prisoner of azkaban and the whole crookshank and that rat fight. But after finishing the book I realise they have all had their insufferable moments since they are teens. Actually them being annoying little shits to each other made them more endearing to me cause they felt like real teenagers. 

I kept some notes for each book in my notes app that I will copy down below. I don‚Äôt think I will be watching the movies. I remember finishing the goblet of fire book and deciding to just watch that one and being slightly disappointed that they left out Winky. I feel like my favourite parts will probably not make it into the movies, like I need Kreacher in the movies. 

My favourite book has to be between the Prisoner of Azkaban and The Halfblood Prince. I went from thinking Sirius was some super crazy terrifying thug to him being my favourite character.

Random notes while reading:

Goblet of Fire thoughts:
- Love what was done with Winky 
- It took them a very long time to get to the Hogwarts part in the book, that kind of annoyed me.
- Strange that Mrs. Weasley was cold towards Hermione after the rumours by that Skeeter woman spread
- Poor poor poor Cedric, teared up thinking about his classmates
- The romance thing is not for me, I wish it wasnt there between the gang
- My heart absolutely broke for Neville. He has gone through so much, I actually cried again damn it.
- At no point did I suspect mad-eye moody to be the person behind putting Harry‚Äôs name in the Goblet. Well played, very well played. But from now on im suspecting every defence against the dark arts teacher.

Order of the Phoenix Thoughts:
- I felt so sad for Harry, he felt like everything and everyone was against him. Dumbledore was ignoring him and leaving him in the dark and the Ministry was being evil to him.
- I really like Luna, she is so whimsical and so herself.
- Umbridge needs to go to hell. 
- Weirdly enough, I always liked Percy cause he reminded me of myself (overachiever because feels overshadowed and invisible due to big family). I just cannot bring myself to hate him cause I understand him.
- Umbridge is a fascist.
- Meeting Neville in the hospital BROKE ME.
- Snape‚Äôs going to hell because why are you beefing with a teenager because you hated his daddy.
- Admittedly, I never cared about any parts with Grawp or Hagrid‚Äôs trip with the giants.
- I love that they have to sit exams and also do a lot of normal student stuff. Hermione reminds me of myself back then and it is all just nostalgic.
- Sirius dying RUINED ME. I loved that Harry finally had someone to call his close family üò´. 

Half-Blood Prince Thoughts
- Romance between the gang was full on in this book. I didn‚Äôt mind it actually, comes with the age. 
- Shout-out to Slughorn, I was waiting for a Slytherin who wasnt evil. I really wish we had more likeable slytherins
- Ginny is cool af. 
- I loved going through memories, those parts were so fun to read especially getting Voldemort‚Äôs backstory.
- Dumbledore‚Äôs death has shook me up. I was CONVINCED this book was going to give us a Snape redemption story. That man is sick and evil, he has been rude to Harry for all of the books. 

Deathly Hallows Thoughts
- Kreacher and Regulus story is hella dark omg‚Ä¶ I feel so bad for Kreacher
- How the hell is any parent still sending their kids to Hogwarts?? 
- I love the name of Luna‚Äôs dad, Xenophilius Lovegood is an awesome name. 
- When Remus Lupin came to the Black house where the gang was hiding and he was acting strange, I was convinced he was just an undercover death eater. That‚Äôs why I thought Harry was picking a fight with him.
- Dobby‚Äôs death and burial made me cry, Harry getting the last horcrux from the snitch aan having all his deceased loved ones around him as he walked to his death made me cry. Neville‚Äôs grandmother being proud of him and joining him in battle made me cry.
- Ron is my favourite character, he is just so real. If I was heavily injured wearing a depression necklace while starving and camping in the rain in freaking England, I would lose all my shit as well. i teared up when he came back. 
- This book actually scared me in certain parts ngl. Them dementors and death eaters lurking everywhere‚Ä¶ very scary.
- Snape was actually a double agent all time‚Ä¶ He was still a dick to Harry but I guess he just really couldnt see past the fact that Harry reminded him of James. & Dumbledore was already on borrowed time‚Ä¶ well played JK Rowling, well played. 
- Harry saying Voldemort‚Äôs name and them then getting caught because of that pissed me off so bad. 
- Kreacher leading an army of elfs against Voldemort had me laughing but also so heartwarming
- Admittedly since finding out that Neville and Harry were both born in the same month and that Neville also lost his parents‚Ä¶ since book 4 that the plot twist would be that Neville was actually the chosen one and the one to defeat Voldemort. 
- Bellatrix LeStrange dying at the hands of mrs. weasley only feels right. 
- Making Teddy Lupin an orphan is ice cold‚Ä¶ ",normal
"Is your favorite book an objectively good book? I was just wondering because I‚Äôm reading the sequel to my favorite book (my favorite book is the House in the Cerulean Sea) and I‚Äôm having a great time.

"Moral Puritanism and the Body Keeps the Score I have about 50 pages left in Bessel Van Der Kolk's beloved and controversial text *the Body Keeps the Score*. I feel like I've learned so much about how the brain functions and I've even gained some practical knowledge for the management of my own ADHD (neurofeedback here I come).

When I came to Reddit to read discussions about the book, I wasn't surprised to find criticism. I was surprised, though, by how many people read the first chapter (which contains triggering content about the Vietnam war) and stopped reading there. These folks decided that Van Der Kolk must be morally reprehensible because he expressed empathy for an American veteran who admitted to committing war crimes. I scrolled through endless comments that essentially said, ""murderers and rapists don't deserve empathy or therapy, they deserve to feel guilty forever or die.""

In no way does the book advocate or support war crimes, murder, rape, or abuse of any kind. It does acknowledge the fact that trauma compounds and causes *more* trauma in an ever expanding web. The veteran discussed in the first chapter watches his unit die around him, takes revenge in the worst possible way, and then brings all of that rancor home with him, where it begins to affect his innocent wife and child. 

How can we ever hope to resolve the circumstances that cause atrocities without ever examining them directly? What good does pushing it away do? 

I'll admit that at times Van Der Kolk's language isn't exactly to my taste, but when one places him in his context (a professional white man who has been considered a leading expert in his field for decades) the vaguely chauvinistic tendencies in his writing make sense.

Is our collective reading comprehension really this low, or is it just that the content is potentially quite triggering and people make snap judgements based upon their own trauma rising to the surface?

(Having read *the Body Keeps the Score*, I'm leaning towards the latter).

I'm guess I'm concerned about what seems like a societal predisposition towards silencing/dismissing any content that doesn't fit inside an easy-to-digest, morally uncomplicated box. Van Der Kolk has gone on record saying that this book was intended for clinicians, so it may be an extreme example with a mismatched audience, but I've seen this modern Puritanism in plenty of other spaces too.

I'd love to read your thoughts. I've previously discussed this at length in fanfiction spaces, but I'd love to hear some discourse about published works as well. ",normal

"I find it hard to get invested in Discworld Let me just say before people jump down my throat that I do enjoy these books. 

So far I've read Mort and Guards! Guards! In both cases while I thought the setting was interesting and the humor was clever, I never became engrossed as I'd hoped going in. Not enough to plow through however many dozens of books in the series when I have such a backlog already, that is.

Part of the problem is that while there's heaps of clever wordplay and the occasional profound social commentary, most of the plot and characters are just stock fantasy tropes but with a twist. Don't get me wrong; I understand that this is intentional and part of the joke. However, it also makes it difficult to get lost in exploring them as characters. They just don't have enough there to them to do that. There's a limit to how many times the joke of ""self aware commentary about how fantasy tropes are silly"" can really land. 

This is not to say that I don't find the jokes funny or the commentary clever. I do. I especially enjoy the occasional commentary on something larger and more profound than typical fantasy writing conventions. It's just that most of the book isn't that. It's mostly silly parody and riffing on the fantasy genre, which while very well done, is harder for me to want to read for thousands upon thousands of pages.",normal

"Just finished The Wizard Of Oz and it blew my mind how good it was Disclaimer- I never read the book / watched the movie and knew nothing about the plot except ‚Äúlittle girl and her band follow the yellow brick road‚Äú.

I picked up this very old copy at a 2nd hand bookstore, it was printed at 1994. Yes, I brought it based on the cover.

And just WOW! That book was amazing, so adventurous and wonderfully told. Colorful characters with rich personalities, amazing quotes had me smiling for 90% of the time I was reading it. I was recently disappointed by how un-adventurous 80 days around the world has been, so I came into this one skeptical as well. Now I wonder how children movies and plays did some of that parts, like killing 40 wolves with an axe or taking out the head of a giant spider.

It truly surprised me to know old writing could be so good, as it usually tends to drags about dialogues and titles and describing of scenery, but this one was quick, precise and charmful about all of these aspects so it was always fun to pickup, like I know I‚Äôm in for adventures and fun read now.",normal

"The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida by Shehan Karunatilaka (Book Review) The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida by Shehan Karunatilaka is such an excellently written piece of fiction which is frankly incomprehensible for me to convey the jarring intensity. Wow, I am at a loss for words in describing this heart wrenching and insightful tale that captures the rawness of the human emotion and displays how corruption and the greed for more, lust and power can twist ones perception of righteousness and lead ones soul to be bounded and chained by them. This is an excellent satire that comments on the corrupted and the crooked nature of the authoritative regime and puts mockery on the concept war itself and how you can achieve nothing with war, only torment, grief, agony and sorrow. Blinded by the ones you trusted.

How the ones higher up in the power can dictate and rule out the lives of innocent and normal civilians and how greed feeds upon souls that choses to obey the lust for power. In this novel, we follow a war photographer, Maali Almeida after he died in an ""afterlife"", where he has 7 moons (7 days) to decide whether to ascend or to stay in between life and death. I'm sorry for being so vague, I don't want to spoil too much about the story so yeah.

As we see through his journey to serve righteousness and justice even in afterlife, caring for the ones closest to him and sacrificing himself for the sake of them, we get to see the unwanted and disturbing faces of the authority, the tyranny that is continued after generations and generations in Sri Lanka (and similar countries in South Asia) and how discrimination and prejudice builds up a nest in ones living soul, twisting and turning the courses of their life. How bigoted views of homosexuality and discrimination against other races can map out the evil side of humans. Here, we deal with alot of racism and homophobic views and how the lives of people in a country build upon discrimination is being affected by such stigmas. The authors portrayal of heartbreak, love agony and the horrors and the beastial brutal nature of war and the sufferings of the victims were masterfully conveyed. So meticulously and elegantly crafted that it will make your heart ache. At moments it will give you the utmost thrill of suspense and thoughts to ponder upon while you try to dwell in your slumber.

The significance of love and friendship, while not being the primary subject of the story, was excellently executed with humorous and playful comedic traits. There were moments in the story where I just straight up bursted laughing, parts are really funny. And were moments where I didn't wanted to progress and felt my soul visibly crumble upon myself. Life after death, being a completely fantastical story while portraying the horrors and the petrifying realities of war and authoritative regime on power while also displaying the degrees of torment and inhumane things inflicted upon innocent souls, incomprehensible and nightmarish fates.

The story is meticulously crafted that displays inhumanity and humanity in realistic lens and portrays the horrors of wrath and greed while signifying the acts of love and sacrifice. A highly political novel that takes on many lenses but never fades on any. I don't know why but I cant seem to say anything more, perhaps its cuz now is 4AM and my eyes are bloodshot and its been a few moments after I've finished the book. I've received alot of great quotes from this book and would like to share.

***""History is people with ships and weapons wiping out those who forgot to invent them. Every civilization begins with a genocide. It is the rule of the universe. The immutable laws of the jungle; even this one made of concrete. You can see it in the movement of the stars, and in the dance of every atom. The rich will enslave the penniless. The strong will crush the weak.""***

***""All stories are recycled and all stories are unfair. Many get luck, many get misery. Many are born to homes with books, many grow up in swamps of war. In the end, all becomes dust. All stories conclude with a fade to black.""***

***""They say laughter is music, but that is just one of the thousand untruths that we suckle ourselves with. Some laughs are piquant, some are hideous, some can curdle the blood.""***

***""Evil is not what we should fear. Creatures with power acting in their own interest: that is what should make us shudder""***

***""There are good reasons humans can't converse with animals, except after death. Because animals wouldn't stop complaining. And that would make them harder to slaughter. The same maybe said for dissidents and insurgents and separatists and photographers of wars. The less they are heard, the easier they are forgotten.""***

***""Because, on reflection, once you have seen your own face and recognized the colour of your own eyes, tasted the air and smelt the soil, drunk from the purest fountains and the dirtiest wells, that is the kindest thing you can say about life. It's not nothing.""***

This is something I would regard as an masterpiece. An excellent piece of literature that dwells into the deepest of the darkest sides of human mind, layered with magical realism and mockery of human actions; while being humorous and striking enough, displaying the raw and bitterness of it all. A story, a book, a fragmented layer of thoughts that will stay with you and your soul long after you've turned the last page.",normal

"One Hundred Years of Solitude is the best book I‚Äôve ever read.  About halfway through Gabriel Garcia Marquez‚Äôs (or ‚ÄúGabo‚Äôs‚Äù) seminal work, I realized that this was my favorite book I‚Äôd ever read‚Äîa ridiculous notion that I couldn‚Äôt believe myself. I tried to convince myself that I was deluded, that the excitement I felt about the impact this book was having on my life was premature and unearned. But as I turned the penultimate page, that feeling had only grown stronger.

I‚Äôm lucky enough to not have experienced much death in my family as of yet, and I think this is a key reason I gleaned so much from this incredible work that evokes the things that matter most in life, and the lessons that the death of a loved one can give you. The Buendia family that the book follows gave me so many of these important lessons again and again.

The themes that spoke to me the most (there are many present in the book, so I‚Äôll limit to the top 4):

*We are all the same.* If you‚Äôve heard anything about this book, you‚Äôve no doubt heard about the confusing naming of each of the characters and their brood. Everyone‚Äôs identical namesakes reflect their shared personality and destiny. The beauty of the book is how it forces you to see these parallels in your own life‚Äîhow you‚Äôre impacted by your upbringing, how your family‚Äôs culture perpetuates without you even realizing it until much later on, and the cycle of trauma, glory, and abuse that we can‚Äôt help but reproduce (no pun intended). The only difference between these characters seems to be the events that shape their experience, but that experience does not shield them from repeating the mistakes of their ancestors.

*Time is relative.* From the first sentence, the notion of time is a fickle one. Past, present, and future are all occurring at once and informing each other. Much of the book is actually written as memories of the main characters. Our actions and destinies are shaped by the past AND the future, and we are unable to break free of these temporal constraints. Then again, that is the beauty of life itself‚Äîthe inability to transcend time makes us a slave to it, but it is also the reason we create purpose and meaning, too.

*Life is magical.* This book is considered to be the pillar of the elusive genre that is magical realism, and I think it may just be my preferred genre now. The way Gabo is able to evoke the hills and valleys of life with fantastical imagery is the most accurate way to depict life I‚Äôve ever read. Remedios the Beauty becoming so elated that she ascends to heaven while folding clothes evokes how it FEELS to be elated. This occurrence, and many like it, are meant to be taken literally within the context of the story, but they are simultaneously metaphors for what life FEELS like when you are experiencing its peaks and its depths.

*Family is everything, and it isn‚Äôt always bound by blood.* There are too many examples to name, but the notion of family is as imperative as it is fluid in 100 Years. The most under appreciated women (Santa Sofia de la Piedad, for example) are nevertheless the roots and the pillars that support the family throughout its history. Other family members, while being a full-blooded Buendia, serve little other than to sabotage and dismantle the family (Jose Arcadio, for example).

There‚Äôs so much more to unpack, so much more to glean, and I imagine that subsequent readings will further open up more themes, more lessons, and more beauty. Astounding book. Poetry in novel form. Can‚Äôt recommend it enough. 10/10",normal
"I like Stephen King's ""Carrie"". This is the first book I've read at King's. It is amazing that King's career could have ended there and only thanks to his wife he was able to move on. She even tweaked it at some points. And the book itself is good.

The story tells about Carrie. A girl who is bullied by classmates, and her mother thinks she is the devil. One day she realizes that she has the ability to telekinesis and pyrokinesis.

The book is divided into two time periods - before and after the incident. The most amazing thing is that this is one of those books by Stephen that can be fully described in two sentences. The after part is made quite interesting, in the form of excerpts from books and articles, and they enhance the intrigue of what happened **that** evening. And the before part is really sad. Carrie's story is about when help comes late, when a person thinks that a parent loves him in his own way and how society can create a monster out of a person. And the ending of the book is just devastating. I felt as if my soul had been sucked out of me.

Throughout the book, I felt sorry for Carrie. She was just a good girl who was bullied by everyone because she was a ""freak."" I want her to be okay, and because of that, my heart was torn by what she turned into in the end. Her mother can go fuck herself. Let this mothers stay in books. I also like that there are people here who want to help Carrie and don't think she's ""ugly."" 

The author's writing style is good. We all know King. He likes to describe everything and everyone. Here's a story about that cafe, here's a story about that thing. We are already used to it and love it. I also like the way fictional articles are written, they feel just so realistic

I like this book. She is such a dramatic book and about how society can turn an ordinary person into a monster (if you exclude the fact that Carrie possessed telekinesis and pyrokinesis).",normal
"how to write book reviews without spoiler hi, i have a book review blog. most of the time, i can get away with not spoiling anything in my book review, i only reveal infos that was already given in the summary since its also present on the back of the book. 

but sometimes, i cant. For example, i was writing *The Book Thief* book review and cant help mentioning Death since he played as the storyteller. 

so im posting here to ask  how would you like reading book review? With or without spoiler? do you mind reading spoiler?

"How do you like to buy books more? In online stores or in bookstores? Recently, I started comparing the feelings when buying a book in an online store and the feeling of buying a book in bookstores. And I realized that there is nothing better than going to bookstores in search of books. It's so nice that it feels like I'm looking for the holy Grail.
 It is more convenient to buy a book online, if only because I do not need to look for an adult who can show a passport and  'buy' books. And the choice is much more extensive. 
But it's still nicer to go to bookstores, even though you have to drive an hour into the city to do it.

"I love books with amateur sleuths One of my favourite things to do, as a lover of crime & thriller fiction, is to make lists of my favorite detectives, serial killers, must-read books and more. Today, I‚Äôm treating you to the list of some of my favorite Amateur Sleuths!

Now, the concept of an Amateur Sleuth is not a new one - we all know that. Probably the most famous Amateur Detective or Sleuth style character is Miss Marple, of Christie-fame. Throughout books and cinematic versions, Miss Marple is typically characterised as an elderly, overly nosey ‚Äòspinster‚Äô, who acts as an amateur consulting detective - and sometimes a nuisance. Her first ever appearance was a short story, published in 1927 and now she‚Äôs a pillar of the crime-solving community.¬†

Speaking of slightly elderly crime consultants, this list would be amiss without Edie - the main character from AK Benedict‚Äôs A Christmas Murder Jigsaw. In the book, Edie is an enigmatologist (a crossword writer, for the national newspapers) with a small cult-following. But some unwanted attention comes in the form of some cryptic clues shared with Edie directly, with a note from a serial killer promising more dead bodies and more riddles for her to solve. Edie‚Äôs nephew happens to be a police officer, so throughout the book we‚Äôre treated to this brilliant back-and-forth banter between the two who have to work together to solve the case.¬†

If you are a bit of a wordsmith, I recommend Martha Thornhill, from Susie Dent‚Äôs Guilty By Definition. Martha is the senior editor of the Clarendon English Dictionary in Oxford - a lexicographer for the ages. However, things start to come apart at the seams when an anonymous letter is delivered to her, hinting at secrets and lies from the past. When more letters arrive, Martha leads her team of wicked word nerds to pull apart the complex clues within them, getting darker and darker as they do. This book would be ideal for an Amateur Sleuth in the making, any crime fans, or any word-puzzlers out there.¬†

Keeping with the theme of octogenarians solving crimes, I can‚Äôt forget to mention the love and attention that cold-case crime-solving team The Thursday Murder Club (and its subsequent series) is getting‚Ä¶ For those who have been living under a rock, The Thursday Murder Club follows a group of pensioners who set about solving mysteries - in the first instance, in a retirement home. For fans of a cosy cuppa, and gentle crime!

The most modern representation of an Amateur Sleuth has to be the ‚Äòpodcast thriller‚Äô trope, with investigative true crime podcast hosts springing up left, right and center. The Girls Who Disappeared by Claire Douglas and 17 Years Later by JP Pomare are fantastic books with this trope.",normal

"Finishing a series now vs when you were younger I just recently finished the First in the City by Jenn McMahon which was amazing, I totally loved it. But I just felt different finishing this series like I was sad that it was over and didn't really know what to do with myself for a little bit after finishing reading the last book. It got me thinking about how I felt about finishing a series when I was younger and I realized that I didn't read a lot of series as a kid. I read Magic Tree House and Junie B Jones when first starting to read but never truly finished them I just stopped reading them because I become older and needed something more challenging.  I read the Black Stallion series and Harry Potter but I was just like ok the adventure is over never sad to me. 

I noticed I read a lot series now but most of them are interconnected standalone series where it either takes place in the same town where the characters are either friends, run into each other/know of each other or it's a series about siblings.  But most of the time the characters from the other books are only briefly mentioned not playing a huge part in the new book, only mentioned or introduced to promote the next book  or brought back for a couple chapters because some drama is happening between the two new characters. Or like Percy Jackson it sort of ends but continues on with new characters along with the original characters in the new series.

Jenn McMahon's series I believe is the first series that I have read where you get to keep the characters from the other books and see how their lives are doing and see them play a part in the new book an actually part not just something brief that it's pointless to the plot. You get to grow and become attached to them. 

I'm curious if finishing a series has always been the same for you or has it changed as you gotten older and developed and grew as a reader?",normal
"Has ever reading a book first or listening to its audiobook first significantly affected your enjoyment of the latter? Sometimes when I don't have the time to sit down and read, I listen to audiobooks. They're useful because you can listen to them while driving, taking the bus, especially when doing mind-numbing tasks like alphabetizing your library

Sometime ago I read a novel that I had listened to years earlier and had hated. The novel wasn't bad at all so I couldn't figure out why I had avoided reading it. Suddenly I realized that part of the reason I had disliked the book was that my first exposure to it was its audiobook. The narrator's voice had been fine but when he was doing an important character's voice, he would switch to this annoying and harsh way of speaking. So I had never finished listening to the audiobook and assumed it was the story that was terrible.

I've also had the opposite experience. This was a long audiobook read by Simon Vance, which was done so well that later made me want to read the book myself. And this was a book I would have never wanted to read in the first place because it was a genre of fiction I'm not into. 

So I've become more careful now with whether I read a book first or listen to its audiobook. And when I do pick audiobooks, read the reviews and listen to samples.

Have you experienced something similar when reading a book and listening to its audiobook version later or vice versa?",normal
"A Trio of Short But Great Mysteries Series While long series build a following over time and can run for decades,  and stand alones may achieve great fame, some of the best mysteries out there are in short series, which often get lost in the shuffle. A few of my favorites:

Sarah Caudwell's  four-book Hilary Tamar series: The gender indeterminate narrator of these four classics-tinged mysteries is a law don often called in by a group of ex-students who are now young barristers to help sort out tangled crime cases in which they have become personally involved.  Thus Was Adonis Murdered, The Shortest Way to Heads, The Sirens Sang of Murder and The Sibyl in Her Grave are witty and delightful romps that also provide nice clues, twists and turns. The young barristers themselves are also great and original characters with their own complex relationships.

Michael Malone's three book Savile and Magnum series is set in North Carolina and features two police detectives who are close friends from opposite ends of the social scale. In Incivil Seasons, Time's Witness, and The First Lady, founding family scion Justin Savile and working class Cuddy Magnum use their range of connections and mutual trust to navigate the tricky local politics that surrounds the dark doings they uncover.  This books offer suspense and action along with wit and humor. You will wish there were more. Time's Witness especially ranks high on my list of best mystery novels.

Kae Ross's four-book Julian Kestrel series, are historical mysteries set in the early 19th century regency period. Kestrel is a young dandy with a resourceful valet, and he finds himself offering to help out friends trouble-trouble that tends to get worse before it gets n better. The series has been lauded for accurate historical detail well plotted mysteries, well-drawn characters and perhaps especially writing that feels convincing rather than contrived.

"Just finished Chapters 55 & 56 of *The Name of the Wind* and I‚Äôm in tears‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt even explain why 
Okay, so I‚Äôm not usually one to get emotional when reading, but The Name of the Wind just hit me in a way I never expected. I just finished Chapters 55 and 56 and, honestly, I had to put the book down for a bit because I was overwhelmed. 

I can‚Äôt even pinpoint exactly what it was that got to me. Maybe it‚Äôs the way Rothfuss writes these intimate, quiet moments that feel so raw and human. Or how Kvothe‚Äôs struggles, especially in these chapters, feel both deeply personal and universally relatable at the same time. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs dealing with something so simple, yet the weight of it is enormous.

Those chapters feel like a gut-punch without being overly dramatic, you know? There‚Äôs something about them that quietly digs under your skin and makes you reflect on your own life in ways you didn‚Äôt see coming. Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but there was a vulnerability in Kvothe‚Äôs character during these scenes that really tore me apart.

1. If Holly was never murdered in their house by her husband, would Millicent have murdered people on her own without him? Would they have found their way to murdering anyways?

2. Does Millicent hate their daughter simply because she‚Äôs a female who steals her husband‚Äôs love and affection? Or because she is a psycho who just hates women?

3. In a similar vein, does Millicent love her son because she is molding him and as a male he‚Äôs not a threat?

4. Would her husband have cheated without being ‚ÄúTobias‚Äù? If he was so OBSESSED with his wife, why did he cheat??

5. Did Millicent in her own way love her kids? Or were they simply something she controlled? She seemed to genuinely freak out when her son breaks his arm and when her daughter cuts her hair, but also poisons her?

6. Did Millicent only marry Tobias because he was infatuated with her and therefore easy to manipulate? I find it against her character to have also wanted children. 

Please let me know your thoughts!! I need someone to talk to about this book!

"Indie Review - City in the Dragon's Eye by Jordan Loyal Short - A steampunk masterpiece CITY IN THE DRAGON‚ÄôS EYE by Jordan Loyal Short is one of the best fantasy novels written in 2024 and like the author‚Äôs DREADBOUND ODE series or Richard Nell‚Äôs KINGS OF PARADISE, probably the best thing you can get for ‚Äúfantasy literature‚Äù on Kindle Unlimited. If you think this is overly high praise, take my advice when I say that this is a five-star book of an actual scale were five means ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù not ‚ÄúI have no real complaints and don‚Äôt want to undermine the author due to the internet algorithm gods.‚Äù

The premise is that this takes place in a 17th-to-19th century-esque steampunk world where magic exists alongside science, but it lacks the ‚Äúcutesy‚Äù quality of much steampunk. It also has elements of the Post-WW1 era where the protagonist‚Äôs country has just lost a massive war with many veterans left broken by the experience while others feel they were betrayed by their leaders surrendering.

Viktor has a particularly problematic affliction, though, in that he now has scales across his body from where he used magic that has infected him with dragon. I mean that literally in that people who use too much magic are turned into dragons and treated like lepers as it happens. He‚Äôs fired from every job and made an outcast. Seeking a cure so that he doesn‚Äôt have to spend the rest of his life in misery, he ends up uncovering a secret society that wishes to start a new war. Victor is no hero, though. He just wants to get cured of what is probably insoluble.

There‚Äôs also Izola, who is working at a university with her ex-husband. Unfortunately, the latter has just achieved tenure and finds the prospect of his disgruntled former spouse moving up the ranks to be intolerable. Having her career scuttled in the most painfully banal way possible, Izola searches for another way to distinguish herself. Her path crosses with Viktor in a way that goes in several unexpected directions.

The third protagonist of the work is an incredibly foolish young dandy named Devin who has coasted his entire life on his father‚Äôs wealth as well as power. Unfortunately, this has left him with an overinflated sense of importance that gets him into incredible trouble when he attempts to fix a fight for some quick cash, only to run afoul of a local crime lord. Lacking any real resources, he ends up not so much over his head but several fathoms down.

Jordan Loyal Short is a fantastic writer of prose but his biggest skill is that he‚Äôs extremely good at creating vivid believable characters that aren‚Äôt typical of fantasy. Viktor‚Äôs worries about whether he‚Äôll ever get a girl with his ‚Äútumor‚Äù or his family now that he can‚Äôt hold down a job are infinitely more relatable than your typical hero‚Äôs issue with a dark lord. Izola‚Äôs inability to be seen at her place of work and regrets about having gotten married too young to a professor who turned out to be only interested in her when she was a worshipful young teacher‚Äôs assistant is familiar in a way that former assassin or princess isn‚Äôt. Yet, this is still a fantastical world filled with monsters and sorcery.

If I had any complaints about the book, it would be that I think naming the secret society ‚ÄúThe Thule Society‚Äù was a bit too on the nose. It‚Äôs like the author didn‚Äôt trust us to get the parallels with the Weimar Republic. Despite that, this is a wholly original secondary world with more allusions to early 20^(th) century history than actual parallels.

In conclusion, if you‚Äôre looking for a fantastic new read this Fall then I think you could do far worse than pick this one up. Jordan Loyal Short is an author who manages to be dark without being grimdark and authentic when other authors are archetypal. The fact he‚Äôs an indie author versus a mass published one is almost as a shame as I think everyone should try this out.",normal

"How often do you reread a book to read it analytically?  I just started my first foray through Dostoyevsky, done chronologically, and as such I‚Äôm concerned with reading his works as mindfully and analytically as I can because I want to learn from him. 

I keep seeing advice in regards to reading analytically that the best way to do it is to do a first read quickly, with minimal notes on the parts that jump out at you, and to then go back later and reread more deeply, focusing on those areas from before and the bird‚Äôs eye view you have of the book to better piece together and interpret the text. I feel like this is mostly applicable to nonfiction but would work for novels as well. 

I don‚Äôt really take notes when I read; I leave tabs at key passages or on quotes that I want to put into a commonplace book later, I don‚Äôt underline because the tabs show me where the passage is (and I have some books I wouldn‚Äôt write in), and I‚Äôve found notes/blurbs in the margins to be a pointless waste of time. I rarely will journal on what I read if I want to gather my thoughts, but rarely. I‚Äôd be willing to more for analytical purposes. 

Is two reads really necessary to capture the full depth of a novel? If I live for another six decades (best case scenario) then I won‚Äôt read every book ever written - I won‚Äôt even read every book I want to. Do I really have to halve that number so that I can reread everything? Is there not a better, more efficient way to appreciate a text?",normal

She is so mean to her friend for no reason, she takes advantage of her psychiatrist. Idk i just found her very whiny and annoying as a main character. I found the book very anticlimactic and i was just waiting for something to happen but it never did, minus the end.

"Wanna discuss a scene of crime and punishment  There's a scene early on after Raskolnikov commits the murder where in his delirium he starts to remember his father and being a child. A bunch of men are drinking, one's insanely drunk and starts rambling that they'll go somewhere and his horse will take them all. The thing is she's an old mare. Like REALLY old, it's implied she's past 20 years old. So anyways the owner said she'll take them, and he starts whipping her furiously and excessively to force her to move the cart, but she's to old and the cart has to many people. So in a fit of rage and drunken stupor, he invites people to start beating her. They cut her eyes, hit her with a crowbar until she dies.

I think this scene had really bad impact on raskalnikov as he saw some strong people beating & killing a horse which is weaker than them and this really caused him believing in 'extraordinary people' theory that he explains to the detective porfery. Now if you think this external environmental thing that he had no control over and it eventually with series of other external things like no friends and having the only friend ruzukhin whom he treated like shit most of the time, these all things become the building blocks of his believes that lead to the murder of the pawn broker woman, i don't understand whether all this had to have happened with him like it was written or it's just his believes that made him do it and felt guilty after doing that.

There is another thing that reminds me of this scene and the hard nut to crack for religion that is 'animal suffering' i mean why did god even create that horse to be beaten like that and die and he must have known already that this is how he would die and if god isn't feeling pity on the horse surely he would place raskalnikov there to feel the sadness instead of him. This creates two perspectives of god according to me, either he is so cruel and stone hearted that he cannot feel pity on whatever he does to humans/animals he is mercilessly cruel or the other perspective is that he is too weak to feel the guilt but can be cruel at the same time like he has the power to get the horse killed and he does so cuz he is cruel and he created humans to have pity on those whome he get killed cuz he is too afraid to feel guilty for them directly.",normal
"Is anyone else noticing a growing trend in ‚Äòsuperior readers‚Äô ?

I don‚Äôt mind what anyone reads and I‚Äôm not judging them for what they read. I simply don‚Äôt like their attitude and dismissal of other readers for not reading the classics.

"Dilemma - book decluttering especially the ones with sentimental value Update:

Thank you all for your comments, suggestions and experiences.

Lots to think about - for which I'm genuinely grateful for. 

I've been quite struck by how people enjoy finding a hand inscribed book in a second hand bookshop, so I might enjoy putting some of these out in to the used book universe, a bit like a message in a bottle. 

Tearing out the pages and keeping them in some fashion is another thought but it currently feels that this would be some form of vandalism but other members of the family might want to do this. 

I have two siblings - when we're next together at Dad's I'll share your suggestions and encourage us three to go through Mum's books and find one or two that have particular significance. We can ask Dad if we can keep them now or may be just quietly earmark for future book sorting times - hopefully not for a good many years to come. 

Thanks again!
HH

 




I guess this is something we'll all have to face someday day, one way or another. I'd truly appreciate insight on what you'd do in my situation.

I've been decluttering my parents house. There were hundreds and hundreds of books. As a retired librarian it wasn't that difficult a task (crumbling paperbacks, duplicates, random non fiction of no interest). Also they weren't my books which allowed me to be relatively impartial and happily, I live near a town with several lovely second hand book shops that take donations.

However this is my dilemma. The most difficult, in fact still impossible, books were the ones that had been inscribed as gifts (e.g. Darling Elizabeth, from Mummy and Daddy, Christmas 1946) or just had my late Mum's name written inside the cover in her handwriting. I find that as objects they have tremendous sentimental value and I cling to them but as book titles I have no interest in keeping them. 

There's about two metres of them. Dad has room for them, so it's not urgent, but one day I'll have to face this emotional task head on.

"Falling by TJ Newman is‚Ä¶ really bad Just finished this and found it to be pretty atrocious. For some reason this book has almost four stars on GoodReads and just had to come on here and ask‚Ä¶ how? Or if I‚Äôm really in the minority who found this to be pretty awful? Coming here specifically since I find the discussions to be better and more honest than GoodReads.

I powered through since it was a short read (fewer than 300 pages) and I‚Äôm closing in on my reading goal for the year, but that‚Äôs 285 pages of my life I‚Äôll never get back. When I read fiction novels, I‚Äôm prepared to suspend my disbelief to a certain extent to enjoy the book, but this was just another level. 

It did have an intriguing and strong start, so I will give it that, but once we hit the midpoint of the book it was just clich√© on clich√© on clich√© and the plot armor was absolutely out of control. It was eye-rolling at times. I‚Äôm not trying to be unnecessarily cruel since I know this was the author‚Äôs debut novel, but I‚Äôm just confused at how this book has garnered so much hype online from people whose opinions I typically agree with.

What really lost me was the wife asking the President on live TV to not shoot down the plane because her husband is a ‚Äúman of duty.‚Äù Are we serious? Like the President is going to take what some random pilot‚Äôs wife has to say into account when making this kind of decision?

What really tanked this into one-star territory for me was the use of the two most overused clich√©s of all time in books and movies. The first being ‚Äúbad guy has a gun pointed at the wife, and there‚Äôs a GUNSHOT!‚Äù (Chapter ends)‚Ä¶(new chapter begins) ‚ÄúBut it was the FBI agent‚Äôs gun INSTEAD! In the nick of time to take out the bad guy!‚Äù Who could have possibly seen that coming, right?

The second clich√© that was used earlier in the book being ‚Äúthe house EXPLODED! The pilot‚Äôs family is dead! Never mind! The house was actually EMPTY!‚Äù I swear, at this point I‚Äôm more shocked by thriller novels that have main characters ‚Äúdie‚Äù who actually stay dead. This book felt like it could have been written by ChatGPT with how unoriginal every part of it was. The characters were also boiled down to their most uninteresting archetypes, which really made this a slog. The entire family is literally just bare bones ‚Äúwife, son, husband and baby.‚Äù

All this compounded by cringe dialogue, a random and out of place World Series game perspective introduced into the book ~230 pages in, and an ending that practically suggests to us we should empathize with plane-hijacking terrorists. Overall just not worth the read. 

I am interested in other opinions though since this was recommended to me so many times. What did we think?",normal

"Somewhere Beyond the Sea by TJ Klune This was the most excited I've been about a book for many years. I just don't usually read trilogies or series that are currently being written, and didn't even know there would be a sequel, so when I found out about this I was ecstatic. 

Not completely sure how to feel about this one. 4 stars because it was just fun and sweet, but at the same time it felt a little all over the place. Definitely don't like it as much as the first. It had some really cool moments and I wish it would have leaned into those more. For me I feel like it lost a star in the last third and I couldn't tell you exactly why.

I loved the part where we finally get to see Arthur lose it and acknowledge a lot of the anger inside of him. Loved some of the scenes with Lucy and would genuinely be super interested in a Lucy spinoff where we get to see what life is like for him as a teen or adult. Loved the engagement scene and some of those moments between Arthur and Linus. Wish they would have had more in-depth romantic scenes, I was lowkey annoyed that at their own wedding they just ""kissed"" with no more description, going right to the children. It felt like a lot of their relationship was focused on the children and I get that, it's realistic, but the romance between just the two of them matters as well especially in a story that is so queer-inclusive.

I personally disliked how the children's solution to Marblemaw (if that's how you spell it, I listened to the audiobook) making Talia feel uncomfortable about her expression of gender was to give Marblemaw a mustache. And the adults in that situation are just cool with it. Something about that rubbed me the wrong way, the lesson should not be ""this person was ignorant about gender and now they get to be uncomfortable in their own body"" idk idk.

My favorite thing about these books is probably how comforting they feel, it's like a children's book for adults. As an audiobook it gives big ""parent reading story to child"" vibes. We don't get stories like this very often. It felt healing listening to the way Arthur talks to his children and the things all children deserve. I think a lot of us didn't get a parent like that growing up so he kind of had a direct line to my inner child at some points.

I have to say, I saw someone on Goodreads criticize Klune for dedicating the book to trans kids then putting no trans characters in the story and that's valid. I thought for sure there would be a trans character (assumed it would be David especially with his intro in a wig) after that dedication and it never happened. I am not trans and don't personally have any connection to trans stories, but I see how this might upset someone who is or does. His acknowledgements also talk about him wanting to be remembered as the antithesis to JK Rowling so I'm surprised he didn't do that. Maybe in a future book. 

Also curious as to whether there will be a third book here, it seems like he set one up.",normal

"Noticed a weird reading trend. So I noticed a weird trend while browsing another subreddit. I was reading a post on r/suggestmeabook titled something to the effect of books you were too young to read that scarred you, and found a strange trend. A surprising amount of replies mentioned the person reading a Stephen King novel when they were - in most cases - between 10 and 13. So I was wondering, what could have caused this?

I mean probably in most cases it was because of parents not noticing what they were reading at the time, still I thought I'd ask.

Personally I had also experienced my first King novel at 13 (I think it was Desperation). It was due to me reading whatever my mother had gotten from the library at the time.",normal

"I can't read foreign authors, how to get rid of it? A year ago, I began to realize that I read only those authors who are similar to my ethnic group. That is, I do not read foreign authors at all, and even if I do, I think for at least a month for this. As a result, I still feel negative towards the author's work, even if the book itself is quite good. At first I didn't care about it, but then I thought that, firstly, it was wrong and even creepy, and secondly, it was limiting. I want to know if someone had such problems and how you got rid of it.

"Authors intentions and results In recent topic about feminist re tellings many people noticed that this subgenere often has a problem with outcomes vastly diffrent outcomes than promised- making female characters shallow, passive (Ariadnne has all her deeds done by diffrent characters) or villifing everyone but protagonist and her ma≈Çe lovers (poor Demeter made a bad mother).

"The House in The Pines - Disappointing It took me nearly 3 weeks to finish this book. I borrowed it in early September only to return it after trying to read but feeling unengaged. However, I don‚Äôt like leaving books midway and picked it up and pushed through. 

The plot is simple: A mysterious man who has a cabin in the woods is somehow behind the sudden death of two young women, and the disruption of sanity of a third.  

While I was intrigued by the mysterious death of Christina and Aubrey, the book did not deliver on the intrigue. The writing style played on the trite method of writing about the same people in two different time periods. But it failed. 

Other books that use this writing style successfully are Behind closed Doors by BA Paris and The Silent Patient by Alex Michealides. 

The plot of a mysterious man who learns mesmerism/ hypnotism from his psychologist father and somehow managed to kill two young women without repercussions was almost too far fetched for me to believe. 

Personally, I believed the writer talked about medication such as benzodiazepines tooooo much and I am always cautious about non medical professional writing about medicines and drugs and symptoms in works of fiction. The author describes klonopin withdrawal in extremely great detail, to the point where the reader wonders if the lead character is in fact mentally unstable. In my opinion the author focused unduly on side effects of a medication and not much on the plot or the characters. The writer adds a stigma to using mental health medication, which I did not appreciate. 

Albeit the ending was satisfactory, and I enjoyed that. The narrator of the audiobook does a great job and was the only saving grace for this book for me!

"What does your magic tree-house look like? Early thirties guy here; growing up the first book I ever read was apart of the Magic Tree House series. I have Crohns disease, so many of my younger years were spent in the hospital, so reading was a big part of my life, especially books where I was able to ""leave"" the real world.

Fast forward to now, im an uncle whos niece and nephew are at the age where theyre reading fluently. I broke out a few of the books from the series I have, and came across a photo of what i think it an alternate cover for the series; where an image of the tree-house is shown. All this magic and adventure, and the tree-house looks like it was built by my drunk inlaw. Basic, dilapadated, colorless, uninspiring. 

Needless to say, they were unimpressed, so i asked them what ""their ideal"" tree-house would look like?

So I have two questions for the subreddit; is there somewhere where the magic tree-house is shown, or talked about in depth?

And second, what does YOUR magic tree house look like?",normal
"A recent book you have read and suspected it may have been written by AI? I have not read many books published in the last year.

"How do we know if an author believes or agrees with things their characters say? One thing I struggle with when reading is wondering if the author/writer is using a character to espouse their worldviews or personal opinions about life. 

One example is Picture of Dorian Gray. Where the characters praise and advocate for a hedonistic life and state that beauty and youth are the only worthwhile things in life. I wonder if Wilde believed or agreed with any part of that. 

Obviously Dorian‚Äôs life ends in turmoil and ruin chasing beauty and youth. So Wilde clearly shows the consequences of living with that ideal. 

But still I wonder if Wilde thinks theres any truth to what Lord Henry says and advocates. Living freely, seizing the day, chasing pleasure. ",normal
"Wuthering heights is racist? Suddenly I saw a video about some man saying that the book was racist and heathcliff was a representation of this anti-Gypsy or anti-Romani prejudice that was prevalent on this time period, but I digress with his statements, as while heathcliff real ethnicity is never explicitly stated, including the fact that is the abuse caused by racism, that turns him into what he becomes. Literally all the misery that destroys both kids life is caused by society pushing heathcliff down, even if he turns bad later and can reinforce supposedly bad stereotypes, he is shown somewhat sympathetic as a kid like an innocent kid in the bed with little Cathy enjoying nature.

"Reading a used, marked up book can be an intimate experience. I frequent used bookstores and sometimes they're marked up---though I try to avoid it because it can be distracting.

Still, sometimes I end up with a book with underlined passages. Some of those times there's an inscription in the first pages suggesting, for example, that it was given as a gift in 1951.

Of those times, a precious few have underlined the same passages that I want to mark myself. In those moments I feel deeply connected to this unknown person across circumstance, space, and time.

"James Patterson‚Äôs Bookshots  I know that many on here have‚Ä¶strong feelings about James Patterson as a writer (many of those opinions are valid, but I digress). Anyway, some years ago, he released this line of short novels called BOOKSHOTS where he & other writers wrote novels that cost $5 and were roughly 150 pages. 

I managed to read some books in the lineup, and there were a few books I enjoyed. I‚Äôd have appreciated if there were other authors besides Patterson on the imprint writing novels but the diversity of genres was great. It‚Äôs similar to Kindle Singles in that regard and the concept itself isn‚Äôt entirely new but Bookshots had some good things going for it (though I think the ‚ÄúJames Patterson‚Äù name/brand may have turned some off despite the good stories on the lineup). 

I‚Äôm an avid reader and, though I read some books in digital, I mainly prefer print. When out on the city or traveling (as I do quite a bit, sometimes you don‚Äôt always want a big book with you. A nice book you can have in your back pocket is beneficial. I have many friends & co-workers of mine who enjoy reading but whenever I talk about a book, the first thing they ask is ‚ÄúHow long is it?‚Äù 

Their eyes will glaze over at a thick novel but something short will be more appealing. I‚Äôm surprised that Bookshots didn‚Äôt inspire other publishers to have similar imprints (at least not that I‚Äôm aware of) but novellas in print on a wide scale (at newsstands and at airports/train stations) similar to Bookshots definitely would help bring in the reluctant and casual readers and ease them up into reading longer works. 

I know this post is a bit all over the place, but I‚Äôm curious to know what people thought about the Bookshots line as well as the idea of mass market short novels bringing in a wider audience. ",normal
"The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir I bought the complete, unabridged paperback edition from Vintage Books (translated by Borde & Malovany-Chevallier) a long time ago. I started reading it soon after, only to become overwhelmed by the first section (‚ÄúBiological Data‚Äù), so I put it on the backburner for a while. Finally, I started over a few months ago, and I feel I understand most of what she says despite no previous experience reading philosophical texts. I‚Äôm on page 439. 

It‚Äôs an interesting book, but sometimes I find it very dense and difficult to read for extended periods of time. Much of it has become outdated (especially the Freudian bits) but I think it‚Äôs still worth reading, if only to see how feminist thought has changed over time. I just finished ‚ÄúThe Lesbian‚Äù section and it took me by surprise.

Have you read it? Why? Do you feel it enriched your understanding of the topics it discusses? Which parts do you think remain relevant, and which parts are not?",normal
"`Les Miserables` discussion because oh my goodness I am proud to say that I finally finished Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. I am eager to share my thoughts and hear yours!

I'm going to begin with the ending: it was just overwhelming and truly, heart-shattering sad, but I liked it. I felt like it just wrapped up the story in a perfect manner, not with a huge plot twist that would change the whole vibe of the book, if that makes sense. I just got so attached to Jean Valjean's character because oh my goodness, this POOR MANNNN can't catch a break at all. His life was full of (besides of his love and care for Cosette) pain, running away and living in constant fear and regret. I don't recall a moment in which he truly ever felt at peace? Even when Cosette was safe in that monastery, just as I thought that things were sort of settling down, he was abruptedly ambushed by worrying thoughts about her future and about how he can't really stay there forever. Correct me if I'm wrong, this is what I'm remembering from the previous volumes that I read in the span of like..2 years I think? 

I just love how Jean Valjean is written, what a writing masterclass from Victor Hugo, really. Even in the final moments of his life, he remembered about the bishop from the begging of the book and honestly, I could not finish this masterpiece without crying. The kindness and support the bishop showed truly changed Jean Valjean's and his way of being. The contrast between his fierce, strong appearance and his tired mind, his remorseful thoughts and his general kindness, I feel like it's something that gets me every time: to write about a person who is not who he seems to be. Victor Hugo took it to the next level, he wrote about a man who on the outside is all though but in reality, his mind is preoccupied 24/7 with distressing and sad thoughts, he feels like his past is out to get him and he can't separate it from the present. He wrote about a man who just reaches his hands to the reader and says \`This is who I am, this is what I am.\` He knows he has done wrong but hopes, and oh, how this man hopes, to become a better human being, which he does.

Just a few more things I want to yap about: I just adore Victor Hugo's writing style. The dialogues are so wonderfully crafted and the moments in which the author talks about the characters' mental state or feelings...he uses such simple words but somehow he just perfectly transmits pure emotion that makes you feel bad for the characters' pain. You may say \`yeah, this is what an author is supposed to do??\` but I don't know, this book was different. I feel like I only read a few masterpieces that truly transmit emotion and make you feel things just like this book did. 

Many moments, quotes and chapters in this book broke my heart a little bit each time I read them, but here are some of my favourite ones: 

When the prisoners pass Cosette and Jean Valjean when they are on their walk and Jean Valjean is just FROZEN in fear and pain as he is reliving his old experience. Cosette is purely disgusted by these men and an barely understand what is going on and asks Jean Valjean if they are still humans?!!! like that was \*chef's kiss\*. 

Every moment in which Victor Hugo talks about Cosette's childhood at the Thenardiers Inn and how each time the Thenardiers did this poor child wrong, Fantine would just roll in her grave, 'cause let me tell you this woman did not die for her child to be treated like that.

Also every single moment in which Jean Valjean's thoughts and pain are analyzed bit by bit, Fantine's \`desperate measures\`, every single time the word \`miserable\` appears in the book, the Thenardiers moments and the description of the purely disgusting environment they were living in (Eponine, you sweet summer child) etc. etc. etc.

In the last pages there was a \`Letter to M. Daelli\`, in which there was a quote that struck me greatly: \`In every place where man is ignorant and despairing, in every place where woman is sold for bread, wherever the child suffers for lack of the book which should instruct him and of the hearth which should warm him, the book of¬†*Les Mis√©rables*¬†knocks at the door and says: ""Open to me, I come for you.""\` The way Victor Hugo talked about social classes, poverty, acceptance, religion, faith, history, emotions, human connections, woman, man, child...about life basically, really did leave a great impression upon me and I could only wish to read something like this again. I can simply not put into words what this whole book made me feel.

I just want to hear your thoughts about this book: what you love about it, what you dislike about it, opinions regarding the characters, the ending, the lengthy chapters that weren't always contributing to the plot etc. 

I'm glad I got to finish it and consider this post a sign to read (or finish) the book!!! Happy reading.",normal
"The Secret History by Donna Tartt I know it‚Äôs a popular book‚Äîhas been since it came out‚Äîbut I waited to read it until after the recent internet hype died down. I‚Äôm glad I did, because I think the ‚Äúdark academia aesthetic‚Äù posts don‚Äôt do it justice.

Richard Papen was a fine narrator, though I now realize he wasn‚Äôt entirely reliable. That probably makes for good re-readability. The rest of the main characters were excellent. Despite being out-of-touch, they really felt grounded. I‚Äôm sure some of that is due to the semi-autobiographical nature of Hampden and its inhabitants. Still, I think two murders are exactly the kind of thing you might expect from a handful of isolated undergrads under the influence of their beloved, batty professor. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if I read about something like that in the news.

The online frenzy is particularly funny because its focus on aesthetics are exactly what made the characters so insane. The tendency to romanticize the people, their tastes and sense of superiority, and the setting are exactly what enabled the characters to do what they did. It feels ironic (not that I know if my usage of that word is accurate or not).

Overall, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth the hype, but not in the way you might think.",normal
"What is the best book cover art or design you‚Äôve ever seen? We all know to not judge a book by its cover, but sometimes the cover is the best part of the book. The cover is what grabs our attention and introduces readers to the story before reading a single word. Regardless of the actual content or quality of the book itself, what is the best cover you‚Äôve ever seen?

For me personally it‚Äôs [this copy of Dune](https://imgur.com/a/XxOI1C0) that I picked up from Barnes and Noble ages ago. You can‚Äôt see it in the photos but there‚Äôs actually a metallic sheen to the dust jacket, and I love the contrast of the copper and teal both in the graphics and the page edges. I spotted this from 20 feet away on a table and immediately zipped over to snatch it up. 

I actually bought an old beater paperback copy of the book to actually read later on because I don‚Äôt want to tear this one up. I‚Äôve never seen another cover quite like it. ",normal
"Thrillers being judged too harshly  I guess this is part rant part discussion. But basically what the title says‚Äî why are thrillers judged so harshly here or the book community in general? Reading is a subjective experience, but that aside‚Äî every time I read about a thriller book that was decent, it‚Äôs being picked apart because it was too predictable or not good enough. It ranges from genuine critique to borderline condescending snobbery. 

Thrillers by their nature feel predictable to me‚Äî I do think there is a formula, and more so when one particular formula is a hit and becomes a trend for the next couple of years. The thriller community comes across as expecting SO MUCH‚Äî like the next mind blowing twist, and somehow if they don‚Äôt then the author is bad. Or it becomes a ‚Äúhah! I predicted who the killer/villain was in the first chapter itself! This book is bad!‚Äù 

Could be the way I read thrillers‚Äî I admit I don‚Äôt scrutinise all the details, I enjoy being taken on a journey. I like sordid characters or authors using things like tense to throw readers off. IDK most thriller reviews come across as mad at the author for not fooling them well enough. What a strange thing to be upset about. Even if you‚Äôre able to predict it, perhaps the way the author has gone about the plot is also considerable. 

This is not pertaining to poorly written (again, subjective) thriller stories with endless plot holes or loose ends, or convenient lazy writing. I just think thriller is a difficult genre to conquer, often predictable and its beauty lies in how each author can adapt to the vastness of human nature/personality. 

I get perhaps the feelings of being ‚Äúcheated‚Äù are much stronger in a genre promising a thrill/twist, and that‚Äôs why the criticism is so harsh. But yeah. What do you guys think? ",normal
"Anachronistic feminism in feminist retellings I'm currently about 20% into *Kaikeyi* by Vaishnavi Patel and the anachronistic feminism is starting to annoy me. Her throwing a petulant tantrum over the fact that >!she has no say in who she marries!< seems really out of norm for a princess in her time. She can think it's unfortunate, but I would think that every member of a royal family just accepts it as their duty. The blurb says that she becomes ""a warrior, diplomat, and most favored queen"" and I get the feeling that Patel is going to have her Disney Princess girl boss her way through patriarchy (please let me know if I am wrong).

I enjoy strong female MCs and feminist retellings, but the ""anything boys can can do, girls can do better"" kind of feminism in a historical context just feels... very YA. I think a more nuanced feminist retelling is *Circe* (Miller) and *The Witch's Heart* (Gornichec), where they deal with patriarchy by choosing not to engage with the patriarchy, until they are forced to, and their ultimate goal is to be left alone to do as they please. Another great example is *Spinning Silver* (Novik) where both FMC takes a crappy situation and use their skills and intelligence to turn it around for them, for survival and political gain, not to prove something.

Maybe I am an old, jaded woman, but I'm just annoyed with Kaikeyi because I feel like I'm being pandered to and it's just as annoying when a woman does it, as when a man does it. But, I am only 20% of the way in. There's a very real chance that Kaikeyi goes through some character arc. My understanding is that *Kaikeyi* is also a villain retelling of a story I am not familiar with, and maybe in the context of her original story, her feminism isn't anachronistic?

Please share your thoughts on feminist retellings. Do you have a favorite? Are they unnecessary? Does it help you better contextualize the original stories? Did I unfairly judget *Kaikeyi* too early into the book?",normal

The first time i picked it up the first few pages seemed to be full of so much purple prose that I almost put it down. I told myself to try it out until the end of the chapter and I‚Äôm so glad that I did. 

Andrew Davidson‚Äôs writing style reminded me a little of Chuck Palahniuk‚Äôs right down to the unnamed narrator. 

Anyway, I just wanted to gush about what a great book it was and was wondering if other people felt the same way.",normal
"The Shards - Bret Easton Ellis. On the ending.  So firstly:

What the fuck did I just read?

Secondly:

What the *FUCK* did I just read? 

Listen, I'm familiar with Bret Easton Ellis. So far, I've read 5 of his books (The Shards included) so I know how his novels get in my head and twist my brain around, but this book... Holy shit. This book was the ultimate mindfuck.

The first thing I wanna say is that I loved it. This is unlike any novel I've ever read in my entire life. It sucks so hard that I don't have any freinds who've read it because this is a book that DEMANDS discussion.

This book effectively scared the shit out of me with every single scene beyond page 500. I had this immense sense of dread that seaped through my entire body. I know Lunar Park exists (still need to read it!) but God, Bret Easton Ellis needs to commit to horror novels. He writes horror masterfully.

Alright fuck it, you aren't here for a review. 

Who do we think was The Trawler? And who do we think was the attacker of Susan and Thom?

Let's look at this for a second. Bret has an insane obsession with Robert Malloray. When he sees that boy in the cinema who he thinks is Robert, he calls the boy ""This God"".

The Trawler, when sending the letters towards the end, refers to Robert as ""Their God"".

We also know that Bret is a completely unreliable narrator. So we don't know whether we can trust him or not. We know that a person weeping is seen after every break in that the Trawler commits, and Bret weeps after leaving Matt Kellner.

Also, Matt was definitely murdered. Idk if the interaction with his father was real, but if so, Matt was definitely murdered. He had bruises, his cat was mutilated. He was a victim.

And also, let's call the interaction with Bret and Robert what it was: Premeditated murder. Bret makes it so that Robert can't escape, can't call for help, and goades him into attacking first so he can justify it. He then completely lies about how it happened. I think he killed Robert out of revenge for Robert insulting Bret for being gay and tricking him.

Susan states that Bret has bite marks on his arm, the same that she remembers from her attacker. In the description of when Susan bites the attacker, it describes her having fragments of flesh in her mouth. Brets arm is described as ""purple and yellow bruising"". Which is... Interesting. That doesn't sound like a fleshy thing, more like a puncture or a sharp bite. I don't know. You'd think there'd be a description on how Susan also notices the dried, open flesh wound on Brets arm but she doesn't. 

There's Steven saying ""You've been warned"". Now, Steven has always been kind of a shady character to me. He warns Bret about Terry and is also pretty sarcastic and almost rude to him in a way. Like he's trying push Bret away from this. 

Then there's the horse, which is part of the Trawlers MO. Debbie is now a target. So if Bret was the Trawler, why Debbie? Is he just that insane? He admits that Debbie deserves better than him so that kind of makes it seem like, on some level, he cares about her.

I honestly can't come ton any viable conclusion. I don't know who's who and what's what. Was Susan part of the cult? Was any of it real? 

Honestly, I don't know, but I'd love to see what everyone else thinks of the book and what other theories people have.

"Translations of The Count of Monte Cristo (Vintage Random House is bad) I'm reading the Vintage Random House edition, translator unspecified, 9780099518945.

It's bad. There are so many variables at play. I don't know if the problems are just something from the French that doesn't quite fit into English, something to do with the era it was written in, poor editing and grammar (use of commas for instance) or whatever else.

There are chapters that feel extremely dense and hard to get through. Is this true of other editions? There will be a dense chapter but then afterwards a much freeer flowing one, it's almost as if this edition has been translated by multiple people, not all of whom speak French.

"Is this why lifelong readers of a topic move to journals? I'm a big nonfiction reader. Some of my main jams are primitive Christianity, gnosticism and psychoanalysis. Tertiary topics to above. Anyways I notice having read many non-fiction books they tend to begin with a 'general survey' of pre existing thought on the topic at question, although always with some obvious-tho-masked bias in terms of presentation, accreditation. The author then proceeds to counter viewpoints they have summarized with a new paradigm or supporting one, often along the lines of charicatures established in the 'survey'.

Do most books in your genre of interest turn out to be introductory in this way? Is it usually better for you in your field of interest to switch to published journals at a certain point?",normal
"I Am Legend by Richard Matheson - How has learning a fact after reading changed your feelings towards a book? I have just finished reading I am Legend by Richard Matheson. I thoroughly enjoyed the book but a fact I learnt only when reading the afterword changed the entire way I viewed the book, and made me think so much better of it.

The book is set in the 1970s, with the year and date being written alongside the chapter headings for multiple chapters of the book. It felt like a 70s book, reminding me of the writing of Stephen King, William Peter Blatty, and other contemporaneous horror writers.

Only in the afterword (by Stephen King) did I read that the book was actually published in 1954, with the book being set in what was the near future of the mid 70s. 

The fact that this book came out 20 years earlier than I thought changed it from a good example of the genre, to a trailblazing progenitor of the genre. The book absolutely shot up in my estimations knowing how ahead of the curve it was.

The language felt modern and readable, not at all stilted and pulpy. The themes explored internal struggles of a man trying to survive on his own, a war veteran who (whilst sticking very close to traditional gender roles) had become emotionally wrecked and mentally unstable as he struggled with the world around him and the atrocities it made him commit. It talked about his vulnerability and the love he had for his wife and daughter, how he cared for them >!both before and after their deaths!<

I have read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy/horror from the 50s-80s, and normally you can guess the decade from the first page, but this book surprised me. It was shocking to me how much my view of it changed upon learning when it was written.

Has anyone else had something like this happen to them? Has learning a fact after reading a text has completely changed your view of it for the better or worse?",normal
"What Does Diverse Reading Mean For You? The post further down today about the reader who realized that the vast majority of what they were reading came from white male American/British/Australian writers and decided they wanted to diversify their reading, I'm curious now what other readers prioritize when it comes to diversifying the books they pick out.

I know what people will consider ""diverse"" will come down to where they're from. Being American, we tend to view diversity primarily through the lens of race and ethnicity, followed by gender and sexuality, then things like religion and class. But I also know that our concept of race doesn't translate to other countries (unless they share similar histories, like Canada). Mostly in the sense that someone could be white here but not considered white in certain countries in Europe, and terms like ""BIPOC"" basically don't have any meaning in countries where whites are not the majority. 

Not saying that doesn't mean our way of viewing diversity isn't ""valid"", it is within American contexts. But I do think it's limiting because I don't think someone can be said to be a diverse reader if all they're reading is American novels, even if those novels are diverse by our standards. Nationality is one of the widest gulfs for us because while America has a smorgasbord of literature to choose from thanks to our country's diversity, we tend to be pretty culturally isolationist.

This post isn't meant to try and rank what's the most ""valid"" form of diversity. There's no way to rank whether a book written by an English-speaking Black American straight woman is ""more diverse"" than a translated book by a Spanish-speaking white Argentine lesbian for an English-speaking white American bisexual male reader.

I'm just curious about people's individual choices. If you're someone who values reading diversely, what do you primarily look for, and how is it shaped by where you're from? What do you prioritize? Nationality? Race? Sexuality?

To those of you who don't see color or aren't the least bit curious about the authors you read, this post isn't for you. I know some of y'all have poor reading comprehension, so let me repeat: if reading this post made your sphincter clench, this post isn't for you.",normal

I was wondering, do you think it was commonplace for common blue collar workers of the eras he writes about to casually recite Shakespeare or other poetry?

"I catalogued the 635 books I‚Äôve read and was disappointed by trends in my data \[Edit: 'Disappointed' is too strong a word - I'll go with 'surprised'\]

In 2021, I started cataloguing every book I could remember reading. The data surprised me and has significantly influenced my reading habits.

Graphs (data is current): [https://imgur.com/a/xcJ7xdJ](https://imgur.com/a/xcJ7xdJ)

Here are my biggest takeaways:

* The authors of the books I read were overwhelmingly white. Nine out of ten books were by White American, White British, or White Australian authors. Half of the books I read were set in the US or England. I realised that the perspectives I had been immersed in since childhood were far more anglo-centric than I had assumed. Since then, I‚Äôve made a concerted effort to broaden my reading. When I first created the chart, about 10% of the books I had read were by authors of colour. This year, I‚Äôve almost reached my goal of 20%. My long-term goal is to read a much more diverse range of books - varied cultural backgrounds, languages, settings, etc.
* I was disappointed to discover that I‚Äôd read only five books by Asian authors, given that I‚Äôm an Asian Australian. I realised I had never read books that reflected my cultural experiences. Since then, I‚Äôve read several books by second-generation Asians around the world and appreciated the shared experiences with the characters in those stories.
* I also realised I had read zero books by First Australian authors, which I wanted to change since I live in Australia. That year, I set a goal to read ten.
* Before compiling this catalogue, I mainly read what my school librarians recommended, what was popular in culture, and what my friends loved. This made me realise I need to be more intentional in seeking out books from other sources (I started with International Booker Prize winners).
* As a school teacher, I realised I needed to be way more thoughtful and proactive about the books we study in class and those available on my classroom shelves. I‚Äôve always known this was important, but confronting my own data revealed that I was doing far worse in this area than I had thought.

**Notes:**

* I excluded picture books because I sadly can‚Äôt remember what I‚Äôve read.
* I use Google Sheets. I wanted to use GoodNotes or StoryGraph, but I couldn‚Äôt find a way to chart the data I was interested in.
* If you‚Äôd like a copy of my spreadsheet, feel free to DM me. I know lots of improvements could be made in the way I‚Äôve organised the data. Suggestions for improvement are appreciated!

**Edit:**

* Reading more diversely has been great! It hasn't been a chore - it's been really fun. This project started when I set myself the goal of reading 52 books in 2021. I wanted to challenge myself to explore genres, settings and experiences that I wouldn‚Äôt come across through my usual channels. It‚Äôs led me to reading some of my favourite books ever. Many I wouldn‚Äôt have come across if I‚Äôd stuck to just reading from personal recommendations and what‚Äôs popular.",normal

"the first nine books of The Skulduggery Pleasant series by Derek Landy My wife and I have read the first nine books of the series.  Personally I find the series to be unique, fast paced, hard hitting, action-packed, and emotionally driven.  At first I couldn't help but compare Stephanie (later Valkyrie) to Harry Potter as she's a preteen who's thrust into a world of supernatural elements and magic.  The part where she's checking out her uncle's house, but it is being broken into and she's at her wits end until Skulduggery comes to rescue her.  I'm like woah it's no holds barred; they're really going to throw a young lady into the fray like that.  There's no chance in hell that I am going to be able to give my take on all the nine books because the story moves very fast and I have read other books in between as breaks; not to mention it's difficulty to recall everything . However, needless to say, the series has been are huge flurry and whirlwind of plot points, organizations, characters interactions, supernatural elements, powers, character development, high stakes, action scenes, shock value, lore, and at times heartfelt moments.  The stakes rise from novel to novel, whether it be a powerful weapon, revelations of true names which unleash alternate identities, being shunted to alternate dimensions, a grotesque monster, another powerful being that grants unnatural power to four belligerent rebellious teenagers, a war between the warlocks, a terrorist plot to blow up a stadium full of people, a necromancer order's plot to eliminate or reverse death (I'm not fully clear), remnants taking over bodies and reaping havoc, and a battle between warlocks and mages. 

There's also international sanctuaries which keep the order of the magical world and the complex geopolitics  of those sanctuaries and internal politics of their councils.  Not to mention a teleporter, a lovesick vampire, a doppelganger who develops sentience, a relationship between a mercenary and her Southern-accented melting-into-the-ground boyfriend, a Yeti, dumb and dumber who are transposed into male and female bodies, psychics, an eccentric lab assistant who murdered her employer when she was possessed, and so much goddamn more that I'm not going to list all right here.  Not to mention that the main character has a baby sister who she must protect but had to briefly ""kill""

After a while, you're so engrossed with all of the characters and try to keep track of how they fit and relate with one another (like or hate, respect or not, history with each other).  Of course Skulduggery Pleasant, Tanith Low, Valkyrie Cain, Clarabelle, Scapegrace, Kenspeckle Grouse, Ghastly Bespoke, China Sorrows, Billy Ray Sanguine, Spring Heeled Jack, Davina Marr, Anton Shudder, Fletcher, Madame Mist, Erskine Ravel, Lord Vile, Darquess, Caelan, and so much more.  I consumed the audiobooks, so I especially loved the voices the narrators had for each characters.

One critique I have is that the series moves VERY fast.  The action is very all over the place.  It keeps things exciting, but it may be challenging to follow at times.  I know that the author was originally a script writer.  Nevertheless, I find the series very cool and hope it gets adapted into a different medium someday that does it justice.  It may be recency bias, but I find it to be better than Harry Potter (but that may be comparing apples and oranges).

We have also read The Magnificent Seven, the Tanith Low side story.  My wife also listened to the podcast drama.  We'll likely continue with the series out of commitment and curiosity, but I must ask.  Those who have read the series, is it worth continuing?  How much crazier and random does it get?  I heard that the first 9 books were considered the original series and the following 6 books kind of ties up some loose ends and fleshes out the world more.  Not to mention ""A Mind Full of Murder"" after that.  Woooh, we got some work to do haha",normal
"Did anyone here read Carrie when it first came out? I know this is a long shot since this book is like a bajillion years old, but I just finished Carrie. 

Having seen the De Palma film many times and being familiar with Stephen King's other work, I thought I would be prepared for how good (and how achingly sad) this book was.

I was wrong.

It's such an amazing book! Even knowing what was going to happen, I couldn't stop turning the pages, and the prose is one of King's best. The dude managed to pull off a *jump scare* in a novel with no illustrations!

That being said, I do wonder what it must've been like back then, reading this book without having the prom scene being a pop culture staple or King being a household name, to be utterly shocked and horrified and heartbroken by this book without any preperation.

"Normal Women - Ainslie Hogarth  It‚Äôs an interesting book, very well written and totally not for me lol. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad book but I‚Äôm clearly not the intended audience. Hogarth is a woman writing to a very woman audience and while i intellectually understand some of the themes in the book, I think being a straight guy kind of blunts their full impact. 

That being said, Hogarth is a great writer who‚Äôs weird way of threading lines of internal dialogue through 3rd person descriptions of scenery or other characters speaking is suitably jarring and forcefully hits home the compulsive nature of Dani‚Äôs thoughts. 

I personally didn‚Äôt like any of the characters expect maybe Clark. Maybe that‚Äôs a me problem. It probably is. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Dani is a great character but not very likeable and in fact quite selfish to me at lest. But she‚Äôs a fantastic unreliable narrator. 

I‚Äôm not quite sure what to make of the book. I guess I fundamentally disagree with the utopian dream scenario the author imagines will happen with legalized sex work. But that‚Äôs okay. 

Maybe I‚Äôm seeing something that isn‚Äôt there but it does feel like she leaves the door open to the idea that this won‚Äôt necessarily turn into some huge success and the evidence of Brandon and Renata and Brandon and Dani‚Äôs somewhat toxic relationship puts paid to idea that this is *all* healing men. And is in fact somewhat dangerous even beneath the happy and respectable veneer. 

Beyond that, I‚Äôll quibble with the author‚Äôs disinterest in reckoning with what becoming a sex worker would mean for your relationship. I mean listen, cuckolding is a very common kink among men but just ending the book with 

‚ÄúHoney are you really okay with me being a ‚Äúhealer‚Äù too?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem with it at all my dear! In fact I find it hot!‚Äù

It‚Äôs not impossible. It just feels rushed and somewhat cheap of an ending. I didn‚Äôt really know who Clark was at the end of the book because Dani was so unreliable. So I‚Äôm not sure how it should feel about their apparent reconciliation. It‚Äôs nice I suppose but it‚Äôs hard to feel any impact on me. 

The biggest issue I have with sex utopia the author seems to believe in, is it requires a woman if saintly nature in the form of Renata to run an ethical, somehow STD free whorehouse, without any coercion, violence or abuse of the women. The more their dream to normalize it becomes a reality, the more you‚Äôll see unethical, cutthroat businessmen join the game who won‚Äôt take the same care Renata did. 

If it‚Äôs truly legalized you‚Äôll still have ethical problems of its own that this utopia seems to avoid. What happens when a worker decides to back out of a contact with a client for a particular act? Can they sue them for money in civil claims court? Can they force them to perform it? Is that really helping sex workers of America lol? 

I digress though. Very interesting book I‚Äôll be thinking about for awhile. ",normal
"When the lambs become silent: ""The Silence of the Lambs"" famous second book of Harris's Hannibal series. Ok, ok! Just now finished up the most famous book in the Hannibal series for tonight! ""The Silence of the Lambs""!

Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee, is sent to see the psycopathic Dr. Hannibal Lecter to get his help on case of a serial killer on the loose known as Buffalo Bill. A highly mesmerizing conflict ensues between good and evil that is designed to stop Buffalo Bill.

In ""The Silence of the Lambs"", which takes place years after the events of ""Red Dragon"", I'm introduced with new characters, plus some old faces as well. And it is, as anyone  who read the series would readily agree, is the best book of the whole series!

""Red Dragon"" is great, but ""Silence of the Lambs"" is the bomb! Mention the name Hannibal Lecter and the film adaptation will immediately come to mind. Lecter is really such a great villain in suspense and horror. He may be a gentlemen but he is absolutely insane underneath it all and here in the second book he takes center stage. And there is the new character, Clarice Starling, who is also central to the story here too. For the most part she's pretty likable.

I haven't seen the film, but after reading the book I'm starting to get a little interest in watching it. There might be some differences, but I still might actually like it!

"Which books had you hooked from the first few pages, paragraphs, or even sentences? Was chatting with someone online about books that had you hooked and I mentioned a couple, which he had read but had not found as exciting. He confessed to having the shortest of attention spans and getting bored real easily. I got tired of throwing names out there and asked what book had him hooked from the start and he immediately said The Martian. I have not read the book so he copy/paste the beginning of it:

>I‚Äôm pretty much fucked.

>That‚Äôs my considered opinion.

>Fucked.

>Six days into what should be the greatest two months of my life, and it‚Äôs turned into a nightmare.

He was right. I was curious what happens next.

In comparison, overall I am a bit more patient. Like you don't have to hit me hard with the first couple of sentences. I actually prefer something not so sensational. I rather there's a buildup. I'll go along for a few paragraphs, even a couple of pages even if it's providing just background info. But I'm not gonna keep reading if by page 10 all I have is a list of random characters whose names I keep forgetting and nothing particularly interesting (plot or character-wise) is happening.

So my example was Native Son. The plot gets quite exciting soon enough but even within the first few pages I had a feeling that I was getting a good intro to who Bigger Thomas was and how his life was going. And that was enough because I wanted to learn more about Bigger.  By the time action happened, I was on Bigger's side for sure and felt probably a lot of how he felt about things.

I DNF'd Mary by Nat Cassidy originally I thought I would like it and I did. Yet the writing style just was not for me and I feel like it was taking too long to build up to the big suspenseful plot point so I DNF'd.

I also DNF'd American Gods by Neil Gaiman. I will revisit this book I loved the TV Series it's just when I started it I had to re-read the first few chapters a few time and nothing was sticking. I think I will really like it, I just have to be in the right mood for it.

Books are listed in the order in which I read them.



1. **On the Beach**

Author: Nevil Shute

Year: 1957

In one sentence: As a radioactive cloud creeps its way across the earth, gradually wiping out all living from its face, a community of last survivors awaits their own inevitable end.

If there‚Äôs one reason you should read this book, it‚Äôs the atmosphere, heavy and smothering, but oddly comforting at the same time, like the world‚Äôs comfiest blanket, and it alone makes me wish I loved *On the Beach* more than I really did.¬†

It‚Äôs a bit of a shame that in a book whose main schtick is that you are waiting for people to die, you just don‚Äôt care much about those people. The characters in here really don‚Äôt have a lot of character to speak of (with the exception of maybe Moira, whom I quite liked), they can be solely described by their job title and the activity they choose to occupy themselves with in their last days. Regarding their inevitable fate, they approach it with either acceptance or denial and it just never causes much uproar. Nobody freaks out. Nobody digs a hole in their backyard. Nobody decides to say fuck it and go out *120 Days of Sodom*-style. There are some little glimmers of hope, but their eventual quenching is met with a shrug and ‚Äúoh well‚Äù. I half-expected there to be a revelation that everyone in this book is popping diazepam as a part of their balanced breakfast, however, of the only two characters who turn to substances for comfort, one ceases to do so as soon as she meets a good proper family guy and immediately decides to turn into a good proper girl herself, and the other one does so less as a service to himself and more as a refusal to let good booze go undrunk. I understand there‚Äôs such a thing as an artistic choice, but at times it feels more like a lack of imagination, or unwillingness to provoke the 1950‚Äôs reader's more pearl-clutchy instincts.

However, somewhere around Seattle the book finally clicked for me. Maybe it‚Äôs because the story finally got a much needed focus, first on the mission, then on the ending itself, but from this point onward, I was completely hooked. The last image is just beautiful and to me, fully redeemed the book‚Äôs weaker start.



2. **Alas, Babylon**

Author: Pat Frank

Year: 1959

In one sentence: A little town in Florida is miraculously spared the destruction of a nuclear war, but now has to deal with its aftermath.¬†

Ok, look, I know that the 50‚Äôs were, uh, a *different time*, but I‚Äôm reading this in the year of our lord 2024 and I just can‚Äôt help having some thoughts.

Out of the five books I read, *Alas, Babylon* seems the most like the product of its time. It‚Äôs also the most straightforward one. The prose is rather plain and never really does anything more than it has to. The nuclear apocalypse is not a metaphor, it‚Äôs not a *vibe*, it‚Äôs simply a thing that happened and now we need to figure out what to do next. Each of the characters exists solely to fulfil its role in the community of survivors as well as the story itself, so why bother with complex characterization when a simple archetype will do its job just as well. The leader, our main hero Randy, is of course a proper white American man with all the proper morals you‚Äôd expect (with a tinge of anti-racism just to give him some edge). The women are competent enough to run a household, but once you leave them without a man for a few days, things start immediately falling apart. Black people are in the sudden social upheaval elevated to an equal status ‚Äì in theory, except they still remain largely in subservient roles, >!and if Frank needs to kill a character, he will of course sacrifice the black guy.!<

Similarly to *On the Beach*, there seems to be an unwillingness to provoke the reader‚Äôs sensibilities too much. There is danger outside of Randy‚Äôs little haven, coming mostly from groups of highwaymen who roam the outskirts, but things never go to quite as brutal places as us accustomed to with the violence-permeated 21st century pop-culture might expect.

But, I just can‚Äôt dislike it. Once I adjusted my expectations and accepted that I‚Äôm basically reading a fun adventure story in a post-apocalyptic setting, I ended up enjoying it quite a lot. There is action on action, the story, once the bomb drops, never stops moving along and once you see the characters in motion, you might even forget how two-dimensional they are.

3. **Red Alert**

Author: Peter George

Year: 1958

In one sentence: One man‚Äôs misguided attempt at bringing peace to the world starts a cascade of events that bring it to the brink of destruction.

Despite being often included among nuclear apocalypse fiction, the nuclear apocalypse in this book hasn't happened yet; instead, we are watching the immediate lead-up to one.

The perspective switches between a military base in Texas, where a single officer decides to spice things up by nuking the Soviets, the crew aboard a bomber on its way to carry out said nuking, and the Pentagon, from which the President and his cabinet try to stop it before it‚Äôs too late and the Cold War turns into a very hot one.

From the beginning, we are constantly being made aware of the passage of time. It takes precious minutes to physically reach people and places, information is transmitted with latency, there are big decisions to be made which need to be thought out - but quickly, because the clock is ticking. Time is the most valuable resource and it‚Äôs constantly running out.

When I first started reading, I was a bit annoyed at George‚Äôs insistence of describing the minutiae of every single action his characters (and primarily those aboard the Alabama Angel bomber) take, however this quirk actually reveals to be serving a purpose, so I‚Äôm not even confident in that criticism anymore. It surely makes the story drag a bit, but it also pulls you in and shows how things drag in real time.

I couldn‚Äôt write this post without mentioning that this is the book that inspired the movie *Dr Strangelove*. However, *Red Alert* is its own (much more serious) thing and it deserves to be appreciated in its own right.



4. **A Canticle for Leibowitz**

Author: Walter M. Miller, Jr.

Year: 1959

In one sentence: As the clock of humanity is dialled backwards by a nuclear war, a monastic order still preserves the old world‚Äôs knowledge, witnessing its rejection, rediscovery and finally readoption as centuries pass by.

This is surely the book I expected the least of - and the one I ended up loving the most. I actually ordered a physical copy somewhere midway through, but then finished the book before it managed to arrive.

As somebody who grew up as an atheist in a largely atheistic society, my knowledge about the Christian mythology is pretty limited, so there are definitely a lot of themes that I missed. Still, the book just completely engulfed me. The world beyond the monastery walls feels large, desolate and cruel, but inside is a safe haven populated by a set of rotating, but still memorable characters (praise the lord and sing hallelujah, we get actual characters this time). And despite its overall bleakness, it‚Äôs also by far the funniest book here.

The book itself consists of three separate stories, all taking place at the monastery of the Order of Saint Leibowitz but set around six centuries apart. The clock is reset and humanity is forced to repeat the last two thousand years of its existence; equipped only with some spiced-up genomes and the power of knowledge of how it all went down previously, which could save it this time‚Ä¶ or not.

I was quite surprised to learn that Miller was Catholic because *Canticle* seems pretty balanced in its views. Sure, a lot of this story is told from the perspective of the Order, but it‚Äôs also occasionally shown to be a bit misguided (to a pretty humorous effect) and the last story presents a dilemma in which I found it quite hard to side with the monks (but again, a Catholic might see this differently - I don‚Äôt have a Catholic at hand to discuss this with though). The book also seems to suggest a certain caution with regards to science, but as a scientist myself, it‚Äôs not something I necessarily disagree with. You can both love science and worry about its application. The Church‚Äôs purpose for a quite long stretch of the book is the preservation of knowledge and blatant anti-intellectualism is a view expressed by barbaric hordes that Miller definitely doesn‚Äôt want us agreeing with.



5. **The Chrysalids**

Author: John Wyndham

Year: 1955

In one sentence: In a religious society that fears mutation and all that‚Äôs different, a young boy discovers his hidden gift that, if discovered, might cost him his life.

Despite being the oldest one, *The Chrysalids* felt in a way as the most recent one out of the bunch. In large part, it‚Äôs because it falls into the YA dystopia genre, which I have sorta associated with the 2010s, but also the prose feels quite fresh ‚Äì simple, but efficient. There are a couple of signs, however, that betray its year of origin.

I‚Äôll start with the good things. Wyndham builds an interesting world, its rules are clear and make sense, the atmosphere is quite grim, just how I like it. The characters‚Äô motivations are clear, shaped by their inhospitable environment. There is always a tangible danger hanging over David‚Äôs (and other ‚Äúdeviant‚Äù characters‚Äô) head and the lead up to his eventual discovery was by far the best part of the book.

However, I just feel that the worldbuilding offered more potential which Wyndham just didn‚Äôt feel like exploring. Except for the telepathy that David and friends possess, there is a total absence of any other ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù disability. Including those, and showing the zealous society shun it as well, might have been even more effective in showing the danger that our main character is in. David‚Äôs group also don‚Äôt really do anything with their telepathic powers, for the most part they just use it as a mental group chat to keep up with each other‚Äôs lives. There is a section, in which Michael, the de-facto leader of the telepaths, relays information that he learned at school, but the others don‚Äôt really do anything with it (except maybe helping him get better grades). I get that they need to conceal their abilities, but the potential perks of telepathy are never really explored, >!at least not until we get to the chase part!<.

Once again, I had a bit of an issue with the characters. There are a couple of really nicely drawn side-characters, but the telepathic group is largely interchangeable. These should be the characters closest to David and since the story is described through his eyes, I would prefer if they were a bit more distinct. Wyndham is also apparently unable to imagine that a woman might be motivated by anything other than motherly or romantic love, which is most apparent in his treatment of Sophie.

My biggest issue, however, lies in the ending. I‚Äôm spoiling stuff quite heavily from this point onward, so proceed at your own discretion.¬†

>!I was still really invested in the story, when David‚Äôs group is finally discovered and he needs to flee, accompanied by his fellow telepaths: cousin-lover Rosalind and little sister Petra. There were a lot of ways the story could go, so it‚Äôs a real shame that Wyndham chose the least interesting option. Nothing that happens after Petra makes contact with the New New Zealanders really matters. David and his group are taken prisoner by the mutant Fringe people, but we know it‚Äôs just a matter of time before they are rescued, essentially everything from that point onward is just a prolonged wait for the inevitable *deus ex machina*.!<

>!There are seeds of ambivalence regarding the New Zealanders sprinkled between the lines, but I could never tell if they are purposeful or purely incidental. I kinda wish there was a second part to this story, in which Wyndham explored the new society‚Äôs darker aspects (give it the Mockingjay treatment, if you will), but he just seemed ready to be done with it, much sooner than I was.!<



**Endnotes:**

* Despite me being overall quite critical, I actually liked all of these books in the end. Each one offers a different perspective on the topic of nuclear apocalypse and they all have their merits.
* By really narrowing the range of books I allowed myself to read, I ended up reading books I would not have reached for otherwise. I found this to be a great experiment and will probably do stuff like this again in the future.
* I found it quite interesting that despite being all written by Western Bloc authors, in neither of these books do the Soviets attack first. I did lowkey expect to encounter a Bondesque Soviet villain, but there was no such thing. In both *Alas, Babylon* and *Red Alert*, it‚Äôs the Americans who accidentally trigger the war, in *On the Beach* it‚Äôs the third unaffiliated countries that start it, in *A Canticle for Leibowitz* we get an entire biblical apocryph and in *The Chrysalids*, there is really no backstory. These choices generally fit their respective books (in *Red Alert* it‚Äôs literally the main plot), the only explanation I had a bit of an issue with, was the one in *On The Beach* and it‚Äôs solely because it feels unnecessary and quite shoe-horned.

1. A Canticle for Leibowitz

3. On the Beach

"The fifteen books that I have read in 2024  I would like to share the books I have read this year with a brief review of each, and would love to hear responses and especially opposing opinions.  The list is from most recently finished to oldest.  This is very general so as to not give away any spoilers.

1: Never Let Me Go, by Kazuo Ishiguro

In my opinion this is overrated, but consistently makes it to the top of most ""Best Books of..."" lists.  I thought all the dialogue and drama between the children seemed contrived and unnatural.  There was nothing special about the prose or language, and I was rather bored for most of the book.  I did like the ending as it gave more context and I can see how it would make some people very emotional.

2: A Movable Feast, by Earnest Hemmingway

I love Hemmingway, but when I read this I did not realize that this was non-fiction, but I actually loved it.  Hemmingway talks about his interactions in 1920's Paris with other artists and writers, at a time in his life where he had not yet enjoyed much commercial success.

3: Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte

My favorite book of this year.  I absolutely love the language, prose, and the storyline.  It's about a girl that grows up in a kind of rough childhood as an orphan and a potential gentleman love interest that she meets, who could be described as unattractive.  I read this on Kindle.  I have a great vocabulary, but still had to consult the dictionary frequently (and I love this).

4: Atonement, by Ian McEwan

This may be my second favorite book this year.  The events of the book span about 60 years.  It is about a young, imaginative girl that misinterprets another couple's lovemaking and there are accusations and the effects of this on the family dynamic throughout many years later, including the war.  The ending was very well done.  I love it when an author can do this.  I love when an author can tie up every loose end.  I feel praise for this book is well deserved.

5: Treasure Island, by Robert Louis Stevenson

Most people know the general premise of the story- pirates and treasure.  Some parts were entertaining and others didn't hold my interest.  Overall, I am glad that I read it.

6:  Murder on the Leviathin, by Boris Akunin

The book is written in Russian and translated into English and is part of a series.  I did not care for Christie's *And Then There Were None*, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It is a murder mystery that in my opinion is much better done than the aformentioned book.

7: Baudolino, by Unberto Eco

I have not read *In the Name of the Rose.*  Baudolino is originally in Italian.  Its about a peasant boy adopted by a Roman Emperor and is quite an epic story.  Some of the politics and the sacking of cities and stuff had a little trouble drudging through.  The second half of the book takes on a little more fantasy elements, which I enjoyed more.  It's a longer book, around 600 pages, and it took me two months but I was also reading others at the same time.  When I finally finished I was glad I read it.  I don't know that I'm in a rush to read his other novel that I mentioned.  I suppose you could call this historical fiction, but I don't know enough about this time in history to tell which parts are based on real events.

8: The Fellowship of the Ring, by J R R Tolkien

I have read the series about 4 times in my life and started again.  I plan to read The Two Towers later this year.  Always fun and an easy read (though I have heard some people say they have trouble with the language).  In my opinion this series is the marker by which all other books in this genre are measured.  Tolkien was a genius in the same way that others describe Terry Pratchett, though I have not actually read any of his books yet.

9: Salem's Lot, by Stephen King

This was my first King book.  I have just started 11/22/63 which was written around 30-35 years later, and I though that the more recent one was more polished.  It's about a sleepy Maine town with a vampire problem.  I have not yet formed an opinion on King and do not want to do so prematurely.  I know he is well loved.  This is a long book over 600 pages and found it a very easy read and entertaining, though not the type of book I normally read.

10: Grave Descend, by Michael Crichton

This was an Ebook which was available on Hoopla.  I have always found Crichton fun.  I don't have much to say about this.  It was short, around 120 pages if I recall.  I would describe it as unmemorable.

11:  The Martian, by Andy Weir

This is an author who is well loved by many and is about an astronaut that is accidentally left behind on Mars, hence ""The Martian.""  Many of the situations were pretty unplausible but somewhat based in science.  The book lacks character development, and has a very plain prose, and I was falling asleep by then end.  I would say I prefer the movie MUCH more.  Sometimes I wonder how a book attains as much success as it does.

12:  Notes From the Underground, by Fyodor Dostoevsky

He may be my favorite author.  This is a shorter read and requires less commitment than his much longer novels.  It is about a lowly ranking public servant Petersburg, Russia, I believe in the late 19th century.  The man lives in poor conditions and is looked down upon by his peers.  I don't love this nearly as much as his more acclaimed works, but definitely worth the few hours it takes to read.

13: Jurassic Park, by Michael Crichton

This is probably the novel I have read the most times in my life, this and LOTR.  The Spielberg flick with the same title is based on this.  The book is much darker than the film and the characters are different.  Spielberg took some liberties for the sake of making it more cinematic.  I love everything Crichton and liked the film equally.  The book is much more technical and science based than the movie, and in my opinion is MUCH better executed than *The Martian.*

14:  Tender is the Night

I read *The Great Gatsby* in high school and do not remember much.  This novel is somewhat based on Fitzgerald's life.  The novel is set in the 1920's and is about a psychiatrist who marries one of his patients and the story centers around their private life as well as their interactions in their circle of friends.  The protagonist's alcoholism complicates his life as well as his mentally ill wife.  I don't remember *Gatsby*, but some say that this one is his masterpiece.  I listened to part of this as an audiobook (and read at the same time) and though I don't remember the narrator's name, her ability to portray the different accents and speak French added much more to my experience.  After reading this I listened to several biographies of his life on YouTube and added more context.  Highly recommended.

15: If on a Winter's Night a Traveler, by Italo Calvino

The premise of this book is interesting, and about the reader's experience reading a book and searching for it when it is lost.  It is a little difficult to follow with the shifting narrative/perspective.  I don't remember it well (maybe because I did not care for it much), but if you enjoy books that are ""different,"" then you may have fun with this one.

So there you have it.  I am not as prolific of a reader as some other people, but I also tend to favor longer non-fiction novels, and some days only read 10-20 pages.  I think it is hard for someone to argue that they have no time for reading.  As I said I welcome discussion.

EDIT:  I also DNF'd a book-  Deathless, by Catherynne Valente.  I only got about 15 or 20% into the book.  It is about a young girl who watches her older sisters being married off.  The suiters are chicks that fall from trees and morph into young, handsome men and knock on her door.  There is of course more which I have forgotten.  It adopts fairy tale elements and they may be based off of existing stories.  I have not sold or donated the book yet, so perhaps at some time I will give it another go.  

I rarely DNF a book.  I always do a little research first and read excerpts first.  In this case I only read a single sentence comparing it to some other author that I like.  This is why I prefer to not go into a book blind.  Then, when I read 30 or 40% of a book and decide I don't like it, I feel committed to reading it because of all of the time I spent. ",normal

"Creation Lake by Rachel Kushner In Bernardo Bertolucci's movie¬†*The Dreamers*¬†(2003), three people are holed up inside a Parisian apartment during the student riots of 1968. A brick suddenly smashes through the window. ""The outside has come to the inside,"" proclaims the female lead. As the glass shatters, so do their illusions that they can extricate themselves from crisis. Rachel Kushner's¬†*Creation Lake*¬†is that brick going through the glass, though it takes place in the present, amidst eco-anxiety, late-stage capitalism, and Covid-19. And did I mention it's a wry spy novel, told by a narrator whose moral compass is by far the most broken out of all the characters?  
  
The central plot of the novel is that the protagonist, code-named Sadie, is hired to infiltrate Le Moulin, a radical farming collective in a small, fictional French town. She has heard that the members are planning a big direct action and has been sent, by someone, to gather information. The author strategically gives readers breadcrumbs about the nature of the event and what Sadie's role will be, providing a steady undercurrent of suspense.  
  
At first, I was perplexed that the people of Le Moulin were meant to be radicals, given they spent so much time not doing anything except discussing their de facto leader's email missives about cave art and the identification of stars. That leader, Bruno, is perhaps a little senile ‚Äî he lives in a cave and uses a shortwave radio to (he claims) contact earlier civilizations. He is the perfect embodiment of collapsed idealism, heartbroken by capitalist excess and the increasing privatization of natural resources (as in France's megabasins of water storage). Bruno romanticizes Neanderthals, whom he believes would be better suited than homo sapiens for modern life due to their sturdy bodies and large skulls, which he assumes held large brains.  
  
Even though I didn't know how seriously to take him, I knew how he felt: who hasn't been so exhausted by events of recent years that they've found themselves embracing unusual ideas? Bruno is the perfect counterpoint for Sadie, who reads his correspondence after hacking into his email. Even as we learn about some of the terrible things she's done, it's hard to hate a narrator this funny. Regarding a popular author, for instance, she says, ""\[H\]e had the sexual energy of a grandmother with bone density issues. His fragile and depleted air would be his unique strategy as a cocksman."" She also shares her life principles: ""My rule is that the older the Frenchman, and the more rural his location, the higher his pants will be belted.""  
  
From reading other contemporary espionage novels, I knew to expect two things: first, that wildly disparate plot elements would come together somehow, and second, that the book would leave plenty of questions unanswered. Both expectations were met and, though I wanted more closure, I was still satisfied by¬†*Creation Lake*.  
  
I really enjoyed the conversations and characters, but I wasn't fully sure what I was reading at times. The plot is slow and mostly light on the action, and I didn't know how I felt about the narrator. This is one of those books where everything clicks into place an hour after finishing. ([This interview](https://lithub.com/rachel-kushner-on-crafting-a-philosophical-spy-novel-for-an-age-of-environmental-anxiety/)¬†with the author was helpful.) Only then did I see the staggering layers of character development, the unruly threads of modern living, and what it means to be in constant conversation with the past. Once I gave up on¬†*Creation Lake*¬†being any certain kind of novel, I was wowed that it wasn't a particular type at all so much as a rupture of one.

"Trollope, Howatch, and Fox: Three Delightful Series on (Anglican) Church Politics Church politics can be a surprisingly entertaining source of reading pleasure-cozy enough to be soothing in stressful times, but with enough drama to keep you awake and reading.

The granddaddy of them all is,of course, Anthony Trollope's Barchester novels, which start with the relatively short novel The Warden, making this a frequent entry point to Trollope for many readers. Here we have the tensions of who will get or lose which plum job or obscure assignment and who will marry whom, but also internecine battles between High (leaning Catholic) and Low (leaning Evangelical) Church that is a key feature of Anglicism (Episcopalian in the U.S.)  There are six novels in all, with Barchester Towers being the most deeply engaged in church affairs, and most of them have at least some reference to them. Both poignant and comic, they set the stage for series yet to come.

Next up is the six-volume Church of England series by Susan Howatch, beginning with Glittering Images and  running through similar soapy titles to Absolute Powers which follow three senior clergymen from 1930s through the 1960's with their now grown children in the same diocese. As well as the requisite church politics these novels are also filled with scandal, psychology, and theology making them real page turners. In several cases the plots follow real historical events- and the tale of Cathedral Dean Neville Aysgarth mirrors the private life of Herbert Asquith one time Prime Minister.  Several more books continue to follow Nicholas Darrow son of one original leads if you want more.

More recently Catherine Fox's Lindford series starting with Acts and Omissions running so far to five books  follows a group of clergy and worshippers in another imagined diocese in which the on-going battles between High and Low are complicated by the current day battles over the ordination of women and same-sex marriage.  These stories feel light and airy as they pull off offering both comfort and real bite with great sympathy for the sorrows and triumphs of those on all sides in the battles. who are trying their best and succeeding or not amidst their very human failings.

"Did you ever read a book where animals play a central role, yet found it applicable to your own life? I recently read The Call of the Wild and feel it was full of good lessons without being preachy. ""Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego.""

And so begins Jack London's The Call of the Wild. This is a book that I did not expect to like. I'm not an animal guy in general and the fact that the book is written from the perspective of a dog (i.e. the dog is humanized), had me shaking my head in the beginning, and thinking ""oh come on!"" Felt like the book would be as deep as a Disney cartoon.

Yet, soon I found myself totally mesmerized by the story and the idea of the dog as a kind of hero that faces challenges and overcomes them and emerges victorious. In other words, it was very relatable about how we see ourselves existentially. The story has a mythic quality, something very fundamental about nature versus nurture and surviving in a dangerous and cruel world, but it is also a story of love, loyalty, and kindness.

It was definitely an emotional ride but I'm glad to have read it. Have you read this book or any other where an animal plays an important role in the story and felt it taught you about life?",normal
"Later books in series should utilize a ""previously on"" segment before the story. I've read so many series where early chapters are partially dedicated to rehashing info, and for whatever reason, every author is horrible at writing that info in a manner cohesive to the rest of the story. It always comes out heavy-handed, inelegant, and unenjoyable. I get not everyone is reading books in a binge and that reading upon release exists. I agree that those readers should be accommodated. But if you aren't capable of writing it cleanly and convincingly (and from my experience, you aren't), why not utilize the TV show device of a quick reel of clips showing relevant scenes ""previously on"" said show? Readers could opt in or out at the start of their reading session and you can write a novel that doesn't bore me for 3 pages of re-exposition.",normal

"recently read ""Good Omens"" by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett and intend to watch the show Long story short, my initial take is that the book has a very unique premise. I don't know how those two guys were able to come up with such a plot. Their characters are unique, the situations are absurd, the world building and organizations come out of nowhere, and the book appears as a fair congregation of both authors abilities and sensibilities, even though I know Pratchett likely wrote most of it.  I listened to the audio book, and I know that there are purists who do not consider that to be actual reading.  That may have affected my experience with the book because I found it to be very fast-paced and random the scene changes and situations flip back and forth very fast and I had to try my best to catch up and I was often lost. I am guessing that the book was able to delineate these scene changes more clearly.   Only after I looked at the summaries of this book did I have a better grasp of what was going on. I like where the story went and how they got there, but perhaps the medium are you using make it feel like it was can a tripping, stumbling, rolling, sprinting, jumping there.  I do not need my hand held to get through this book or other books. I guess it's just the style I'm not fully used to yet and still find challenging (which part of me does enjoy, believe it or not) and that's even afterward consuming several books of both authors before. Though I do find the story, characters, and relatable moments enjoyable, I admit that I do have to do little bit more of deciphering.

"what constitutes as a ""children's book?"" I've always thought the go to answers for this question would be along the lines of Frog and Toad, The Berenstein Bears, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Green Eggs and Ham, If You Give a Mouse A Cookie, The Cat in the Hat, Captain Underpants, Junie B. Jones, Beverly Clearly books,  Goodnight Moon, The Velveteen Rabbit, Courduroy the bear, Amelia Bedilia, Charlotte's Web, Madeline, Bridge to Terabithia, Shiloh, Clifford the Big Red Dog, and so on and so forth.  However, I've read stuff such as Alice in Wonderland, Coraline, Percy Jackson, Artemis Fowl, Harry Potter, The Bartimaeus Trilogy, The House of the Scorpion, Anne of the Green Gables, The Wizard of Earthsea, and The Prydain Chronicles.  Though those books were enjoyable, I was wondering why they would be considered children's books also.  Typically the duration is longer, the writing style is denser and more complex, the plots and characterization and world-building require extra attention, and the themes may be heavier.  

So what defines a ""children's book""?  Is it the level of difficulty?  The simplicity or complexity of the themes?  The prose?  The duration?  The maturity of the themes addressed?  Another pattern I noticed were some of the heftier ""children's book"" tend to be older; Earthsea and Prydain was from the 60's and Anne of Green Gables was from 1900's.  Was the expected reading level and reading comprehension of children different back then?  ",normal

"I read The Perks of Being a Wallflower and oh boy, I have so many things to say!  


During the Christmas holidays, one of my aunts gifted me a copy of ""The Perks of Being A Wallflower"". Need I to say anything more? I think that the majority of people have heard about this book. Personally, although I was familiar with it, I never had the chance or interest to read it. But now I did. And I have so much to say. Beware because this post is long! 


##**Writing style**

I think that I'll start with the writing style. I absolutely _LOVE_ reading books in the diary format. As someone who has been keeping diaries throughout the years, from the age of six till sixteen, I have a special attachment with books that are written as a diary. This style allowed me to connect more with Charlie since he describes everything from his point of view. 

I found the writing to be quite charming. I had read some complaints on Goodreads' reviews about it, which said that Charlie spoke like a very young child instead of a 15 years old boy. Personally, I found no issue with that. Yes, I admit that at times some phrases would be repetitive but I didn't mind the wording. Trust me, when I was 15 years old, I didn't write any better on my diaries. You _don't_ want to see what I wrote, unless you want to cringe. Charlie was a 15 years old boy who wanted to find a way to express his bottled thoughts and communicate with someone. Last time I checked, a teenager wouldn't write on his diary as if he were Charles Dickens or Jane Austen. I actually related with Charlie in that aspect because when I would write on my diary, I would pretend I was writing to another person and my thoughts would be all over the place, jumping from one topic to another. The simplicity of Charlie's words didn't bother me at all. I understand why some people found it weird, especially considering that Charlie was praised for his essays by his professor but again: writing an essay for school is different than writing on a diary. Besides, there were many times when the writing became more serious and there were many quotes that hit me very hard. 


##**Characters**

The characters are definitely one of the strongest (if not the strongest) aspects in this book. They had their flaws, they had their own demons to deal with but it was still very interesting to follow their evolution. With one way or another, most of them ended up changing a little compared to how I met them at the beginning. Especially Charlie. 

Let me tell you something: I am 18 years old and I have just finished high school. Actually, in October I'll start going to university and study psychology, my major. As you can tell, I am not as old as Charlie. And I can't say that I related with him insome aspects because I had a good experience in my first year in high school (minus covid), I don't carry the same trauma with Charlie, I always have great times with my relatives...And yet, I felt connected with him, in some weird way. There were times in my life when I felt awkward or anxious like Charlie did. When I was younger, I remember that sometimes it would become quite difficult to socialise with other people, despite me being a sociable person most of the time. I am also good at paying attention to those around me, even when it seems like I don't. Like Charlie, I think that I can observe other people and read them (especially in school, I always did that when I noticed strange behaviors from classmates). At no point my anxiety or awkwardness matches Charlie's, but still, I kinda found myself in him. 

I feel like I could write a whole essay about Charlie. He is the type of character to whom I immediately feel drawn to. What can I say, characters who are trying to fit into society and navigate through their lives while trying to deal with their problems have a soft place in my heart. I was really rooting for Charlie, since the first pages. I really wanted him to find more people who would make him feel comfortable with himself and open up more. I desperately wanted him to love himself. There were times when I felt happy, when things went well. And then I felt anxious if things didn't turn so good. At some points I was even angry. But most importantly, I just wanted to reach out (metaphorically of course) and hug Charlie. Because I wanted him to know that he was loved. That it's okay to care about yourself. And that he was not alone. 

>I just wish that God or my parents or Sam or my sister or someone would just tell me what's wrong with me. Just tell me how to be different in a way that makes sense. To make this all go away. And disappear. I know that's wrong because it's my responsibility, and I know that things get worse before they get better because that's what my psychiatrist says, but this is a worse that feels too big.

This quote right here broke me. I was bawling my eyes out for five minutes after I read it. I truly pitied Charlie there. I really did. I can't imagine how horrible it is to feel bad about ourselves and try to find the reason why we are wrong. Especially for a teenager, this must be really tragic. Charlie felt suffocated by himself and he desperately wanted to become more normal. He wanted to fit in and find some kind of comfort. His journey was truly remarkable. He become more mature (mentally and emotionally), he strengthens the relationship with his family, he finds new friends and at the very end, he owns his trauma and decides to be a better person and not let his past define him. He moves on and he follows his own path. And for that, I felt extremely proud of him. 

As I said, the rest of characters were very interesting. I think they added a lot to the story and Charlie's development. The dynamic with his family was both sad yet sweet because it was clear that his parents and siblings cared about each other. I really liked that the parents, despite their bad upbringing and toxic families, broke the cycle of abuse and raised their children with the best way they could. They were not perfect but they were not horrible either. 

For the most part, I really enjoyed Charlie's friendship with Sam and Patrick. It was so nice to see that he was finally comfortable doing activities out of his comfort zone, picking new interests and feeling like he belonged to a group. Truth be said, there were times when I didn't like Sam and Patrick's antics. Them isolating Charlie after he kissed Sam instead of Mary Elizabeth didn't feel that good with me and they were pretty much irresponsible around him, like allowing him to smoke or do LSD. And the kiss between Patrick and Sam wasn't great but yeah. I totally understand that they had their own problems. They were 18 years old trying to find their own place in this world while dealing with their trauma. Yes, their actions weren't always the best but I could justify them to some extent. They still played a fundamental role in Charlie's growth and they gave him many happy memories. They cared for him, I think this is more than clear and they showed him what it feels like to belong somewhere. 

##**Charlie's trauma**

And now let's talk about Charlie's trauma...Honestly, why do so many people overlook this? I have seen the book or the movie being advertised as a cheesy, coming-of-age experience but this far from the actual truth. I had no idea that sexual abuse and child molestation such important themes in the book and that Charlie himself had been sexually abused by his aunt.  It was truly heartbreaking to see him realising the hard truth. Throughout the book he has been praising his aunt, highlighting their relationship and how much of an impact her death had on him, how guilty he felt because of her death...and then boom. I found the portrayal of Charlie's PTSD very realistic and I think that this is not being brought up enough when it comes to the book/movie. Why do so many people choose to ignore this? 

##**Conclusion**

So, I am done. I have so much left to say but I think that'll do it. This book has been stuck on my mind and I really think that it will become one of my favourites. It has many poignant lessons and themes and I would definitely recommend it to someone. I think that it's important to keep in mind that you are not defined by your trauma only or how you grew up. What matters is how *you* choose to keep up with your life and what kind of person you'll become. It's not always easy. But it's not impossible.

"We have always lived in the castle by Shirley Jackson  I have just completed this book and I felt it pointless and bizzare but surprisingly not boring at all. The story is written so well that you keep reading even if there is no sense in it. 

Honestly I think Merricat was pure evil. She wanted  Constance to herself only. When Cousin Charles tried to free Constance from her she felt so irritated. I think she loved her but her love was so twisted that she justified hurting others for that. 

Only if it was Constance's Husband or Father, things would have appeared so different but Merricat concealed it so perfectly that we didn't realised Constance was trapped with her for ever and ever.

"Sula by Toni Morrison I‚Äôve only seen positive reviews about this book and the fact this book and author has won multiple awards, I picked it up.

Being a person of colour, I do relate with racial discrimination and wanted to read more about it. I personally found the first couple of chapters as well as the author‚Äôs introduction quite heartwarming and proceeded ahead with the book.

As I read ahead, I came across incidents of Murder (Eva murders her son in cold blood), accidental death of Chicken (a little boy named Chicken slips off Sula‚Äôs hands and drowns in a lake), Sula‚Äôs mother abruptly catches fire (the reason is not detailed in the book) and finally Sula sleeps with her best friend‚Äôs husband.

All of these incidents left me confused about what‚Äôs exactly the point of this story. As the blurb describes it‚Äôs a story of friendship, however the friendship doesn‚Äôt have any depth and it ends abruptly when one friend goes behind other‚Äôs back, THAT TOO JUST AFTER LAUGHING AND HAVING A GOOD TIME TOGETHER.

There were no heartwarming notes to any scene or chapter. All I read was ABRUPT CRIMES ONE AFTER THE OTHER. Which left me quite upset.

Moreover the language used in this book was extremely hard to decipher. There was an instant where the two young girls when they were 12 years old were playing with a tree bark and poking it in the ground. At first read, I could only make out that a sweet child‚Äôs play is explained. But when I went online and read interpretation, it was actually them discovering sexual activity with a tree bark)

I really wanted to love this masterpiece, however, I found myself fighting with feelings of outrage and perplexity as I encountered the justified crimes within its pages. While I acknowledge that extraordinary circumstances can drive individuals to extreme actions, I couldn't reconcile with the way the book seemed to provide rationale for acts of violence and cheating, which left me unsettled. I didn‚Äôt find Sula heroic enough for Nel to remember her soo intensely towards the end. This comes from someone who know how it feels to have been cheated on by a best friend. 

I would have loved if the story was focused on Nel rather than Sula and would have loved Sula regretting her decision to have betrayed her friend and remember her intensely.

Does anyone relate with me? If not, I really want to know what is it about the book which made a 5‚≠êÔ∏è for multiple people. Because I still really want to discover the beauty of the book.

"The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead I was first introduce to Colson Whitehead by reading the Underground Railroad before watching the show. He displays great visuals and worldbuilding in his writing. I was excited to get into a new book by him. When I came across this book at a thrift store for $3 I began my journey. 

I was surprised by how much the book creates an atmosphere for how short it is. I was haunted by Nickel Academy through and through. 

STARTING OFF ELWOOD GOT PLAYED!!!! The story shows how dark and devasting it begins. He was just getting a ride. I really liked his introduction how he was a hard worker, soft and loved his grandma. 

I also think about the first night they took him into the white house. How the book transitions to horror from that point on. You realize the peril in Griff after he won, how that boy thought he was escaping but the guy drove him write back into nickel. 

Harper was such a complex character because he was genuinely nice to them. But he was the one to kill the Elwood at the end. I found the aspect of the letter quite intriguing I wanted Elwood to pass it along but I was scared something might happen to him. 

Turner was a great character through and through with his commentary. OKAY THE ENDING. That was one of the best bait and switch twists I‚Äôve have seen!!!! I had to read the paragraph 3 times just for it to make sense. 

Turner survived. Elwood did not. Elwood had died the day of his undoing in the beginning of the book. Elwood was one of the bodies they found. Turner going on to New York City being successful. Taking on his name. Him choosing to bury his friend. Wow. I was stunned. I had to look off to the distance and think. 

Also enjoyed Turner being at the Richmond hotel at the end. This book when I finished it felt like it enriched my life. A lot of moments are sticking with me such as his grandma saying the lawyer left. Turner and Elwood escaping. 

I did find the Underground Railroad better in imagery. The ending made this book perfect for me. 

Can‚Äôt wait to see the movie and read Harlem shuffle!

"My take on South of the Border, West of the Sun by Haruki Murakami This 1992 book proved to be an excellent novel. I hesitated to read it for a long time because of its strange title, but now I see that I shouldn't have, a completely ""Murakami"" text, with melancholic love scenes, philosophizing about the past, present and future, about human mortality. There is no specific magic in it, but quite a few of the writer's realistic characteristics and magical mood creation are present.

I had a wonderful reading experience, the barely 200 pages or 15 chapters flew by easily. 

An ideal start both for those familiar with the author and for those who just want to read a well-written, short novel in the same vein as Heller: Something Happened and Hornby: High Fidelity.

My idea of the stars of the movie version:

* Hajime, the protagonist, story teller: Eric Bana
* Shimamoto, the femme fatale: Scarlett Johansson
* Yukiko, the wife: Rebecca Hall

So I've done the hardest part with the casting, you are welcome, Hollywood, it is your turn now.",normal

"Greatest quality vs sales gaps - and why you think it is? I was just looking at a couple book lists, one ""best of 2024"" and one ""best-selling of 2024""; it got me thinking more about the gap. 

What are your picks for books that show the greatest gap, in either direction (great but terrible sales, awful but great sales), and more interestingly why do you think it's the case? 

I've seen plenty on Colleen Hoover (It Ends With Us def on my list, with the movie further boosting sales...) - curious for a broader range, including older/historical works!

Some examples in my view: 
- Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake. Certainly respected in certain reader circles, but I swear it's so underrepresented in both sales and general public recognition, despite being both great and accessible in a genre that's pretty popular. Quality wise could've been another Handmaid's Tale.
- In the other direction, Mexican Gothic. It was good, but I found myself wondering why it blew up *so* much, showing up in every book club and making every best seller list, etc.

"Question about the end of Recursion by Blake Crouch This question definitely involves SPOILERS, so if you haven't read the book, you might want to stop reading NOW. 


Final warning!


OK, for those who have read it, I just finished and thought, ""Well, that's a nice sweet ending. Barry saved the world and is about to be reunited with Helena."" 

BUT then I thought more about the final sentence fragment: ""And he says--""

And it dawned on me that that last scene occurred the night of Nov. 5, 2018 -- the same time and date that several major timeline resets occurred, including the original one by Slade!

So did Barry ultimately fail to reset the original timeline, because Slade lied to him about him to do it? Or was this just the author toying with readers?

Because everything in the final chapter and epilogue, up to that point, had led us to believe that Barry had succeeded and ended the catastrophic loop.

Anyway, I'd be interested to hear what other fans of this book  think.

"Is it often that you enjoy an author's entire catalogue?  Through trial and error I've discovered that very few authors have a catalogue which I can read in its entirety. So often I discover an author, read one of their books and absolutely adore it! This sends me on a mission to buy all their books. Yet I usually find their other work far too similar and I'm simply let down. Take Mariana Enriquez' Our Share of Night, which I love! Such a fascinating and unique read. Yet I'm halfway into one of her short story collections and I'm finding it way too similar to her novel. It simply falls flat.

To avoid reading and genre fatigue I do mix it up quite dramatically, jumping from classic lit to sci fi to non fiction, but even still I find myself struggling to experience the high I often feel after reading that first incredible book by a particular author.

"Book review: Lost Gods by Brom 
Book Review: ‚ÄúLost Gods‚Äù by Gerald Brom

‚ÄúLost Gods‚Äù by Gerald Brom is a dark, atmospheric journey through the realms of the afterlife that is as haunting as it is captivating. From the first page, Brom immerses readers in a richly textured world, one where ancient mythologies and horror intertwine to create a vision of purgatory that is both terrifying and mesmerizing.

The atmosphere in ‚ÄúLost Gods‚Äù is one of its greatest strengths. Brom‚Äôs depiction of purgatory is a decaying, nightmarish landscape filled with grotesque creatures, eerie cities, and dark, forgotten deities. The horror elements are woven masterfully into the setting. From the terrifying underworld creatures to the disturbing encounters that Chet Moran, the protagonist, faces, the novel never lets you forget the omnipresent danger lurking around every corner. The palpable sense of dread gives the book its heart-pounding intensity, reminding me of the CW‚Äôs ‚ÄúSupernatural,‚Äù specifically Dean Winchester‚Äôs time in purgatory where survival against otherworldly horrors is a constant struggle and the interweaving of various mythologies to form a cohesive universe.

Chet Moran‚Äôs journey through purgatory is gripping not just for the action and horror but for his personal growth as well. Initially thrown into the underworld to save his wife and unborn child, Chet‚Äôs determination is tested as he navigates this hostile environment. His growth is compelling, as we see him transform from a man thrust into a horrifying situation to someone who becomes more resourceful, resilient, and courageous.

What stands out about ‚ÄúLost Gods‚Äù is its seamless blending of mythologies. Brom takes gods, angels, and demons from various pantheons‚ÄîNorse, Greek, Egyptian, and more‚Äîand fuses them into a cohesive universe. I loved that the angels and gods appear as more morally complex figures rather than simple good-or-evil archetypes. Brom‚Äôs angels, in particular, are fascinating. They aren‚Äôt the purely benevolent beings one might expect, and their portrayal here feels more grounded in ancient texts and folklore, giving them a darker, more dangerous edge.

Purgatory in ‚ÄúLost Gods‚Äù isn‚Äôt just a place‚Äîit‚Äôs a character in itself. Brom describes it with such vivid detail that it‚Äôs impossible not to feel completely immersed in the oppressive, decaying environment. It‚Äôs a world where ancient gods vie for control and the dead fight to survive, with Chet caught in the middle.

In conclusion, ‚ÄúLost Gods‚Äù is a must-read for fans of dark fantasy and horror. The gripping horror elements, deeply rooted in mythology, paired with Chet Moran‚Äôs powerful character arc, make it an unforgettable experience. Brom has created a dark, complex world where mythology and horror combine seamlessly, and it‚Äôs a journey worth taking.

"Characters you are not quite sure how to feel about? So I was reading Wuthering Heights and I got to say I hate, hate, hated Heathcliff. Not so much when he was younger but as he got older and getting his revenge. Felt so cruel and at times I saw him almost as a kind of psychopath, a villain.

Was talking about the book and later got into a debate with someone who said Heathcliff's behavior made total sense for him and his behavior was justified. Now I'm not sure how to feel about him. I mean yes he was victimized but does that mean he gets a free pass to be a sadist? Maybe for whatever reason I never sympathized with him enough when he was young and subject to cruelty, which is why his later behavior seems to me to be more reflective of who Heathcliff is and is capable of than a reaction to what happened to him.

"Book tracking apps - thinking of switching to Fable? I've used Goodreads for probably 10 years, but there are two big issues I have with it and I know that there's at least one that they don't plan on changing. 1) Use of half stars.

And 2) being able to filter through my TBR when I'm at a store or library and am searching for something to read in a specific genre. 

I found the app called Fable recently and it does both of these things, as well as provides some pretty cool stats (average rating, typical genre, etc). 

I did transfer over my Goodreads info to give it a try. Has anyone used it before?

"There are Rivers in the Sky by Elif Shafak Elif Shafak's novel¬†*There Are Rivers in the Sky*¬†follows three disparate individuals separated by time and location. Arthur Smyth (whose full name is ""King Arthur of the Sewers and Slums"") is born in the stinking muck along the Thames River in 1840. Narin is a nine-year-old Yazidi girl growing up on the banks of the Tigris River in 2014, shepherded by her grandmother. And thirty-year-old Zaleekah Clarke is a hydrologist living on a houseboat in London in 2018, trying to move beyond her failed marriage. As the characters' lives unfold on the pages of this remarkable book, readers gradually learn how they're tied together, with the last pieces falling into place at the very end of the story.

Shafak begins her tale with a sentient drop of water falling on King Ashurbanipal of Ninevah (reigned 669‚Äì631 BCE):

>""Dangling from the edge of the storm cloud is a single drop of rain ‚Äî no bigger than a bean and lighter than a chickpea. For a while it quivers precariously ‚Äî small, spherical and scared. How frightening it is to observe the earth below opening like a lonely lotus flower. Not that this will be the first time: it has made the journey before ‚Äî ascending to the sky, descending to¬†*terra firma*¬†and rising heavenwards again ‚Äî and yet it still finds the fall terrifying.""

This tiny observer appears throughout the novel, present at various times in history (the same drop appears at Arthur's birth, and later makes up one of Zaleekah's tears). Indeed, the variability yet permanence of water is a major theme. ""While it is true that the body is mortal,"" the author writes, ""the soul is a perennial traveler ‚Äî not unlike a drop of water."" Later, ""Many kings have come and many kings have gone‚Ä¶never forget the only true ruler is water,"" and, ""Women are expected to be like rivers ‚Äî readjusting, shapeshifting."" Shafak's writing is lyrical, bordering on poetic, as she weaves this theme into her narrative.

The author's focus varies between her characters, making the experience of reading about each almost like reading three different books. By far the most detailed and appealing story is Arthur's; it fits squarely in the realm of historical fiction as Shafak takes a deep dive into life for the lower classes in Victorian London. Based on George Smith ‚Äî a self-taught Assyriologist who was the first to translate the¬†*Epic of Gilgamesh*¬†into modern language ‚Äî this remarkable man rises from tosher (someone who scavenges in the sewers) to expert on cuneiform. The section is crammed with tiny details that bring the period to life. For example, Arthur buys eel pies as a treat for his brothers and reads by the light of the moon because his family has no money for lamps or candles.

Narin's role in the story allows the author to portray the Yazidis, a Kurdish religious minority whose beliefs include elements of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Often persecuted throughout history, people from this sect were victims of genocide by the Islamic State from 2014-2017. Yazidi experiences, wisdom, and values are depicted through the character of Narin's grandmother. While this part of the novel is set in more recent times, some of the concepts it contains are ancient.

And finally, Zaleekah epitomizes the struggles of many modern women still trying to establish a place for themselves in the world. She's at a crossroads in her life, wrestling with depression and unable to move forward. Her story might be the least interesting simply because it's so familiar to many of us; she's a typical woman on a voyage of self-discovery. This part of the novel is primarily bildungsroman. Zaleekah's overbearing uncle and a tattoo artist who only works in cuneiform add color.

One of the brilliant aspects of the novel is the author's ability to merge these three completely different storylines into a compelling whole.

I truly enjoyed Shafak's writing, but periodically she itemizes rather than describes:

>""Whatever is unwanted is discarded into the river. Spent grain from breweries, pulp from paper mills, offal from slaughterhouses, shavings from tanneries, effluent from distilleries, off-cuts from dye-houses, night-soil from cesspools and discharge from flush toilets‚Ä¶all empty into the Thames, killing the fish, killing the aquatic plants, killing the water.""

These lists are unnecessarily exhaustive; they're included with enough frequency that the technique starts to grate. And while I was enthralled by each character's story, I became impatient waiting for the threads to start coming together. The tie-ins are ultimately brilliant but the author takes her time.

Those complaints aside,¬†*There Are Rivers in the Sky*¬†is a superb work of literary and historical fiction, and I highly recommend it to most audiences. It reminded me very much of Anthony Doerr's excellent novel¬†Cloud Cuckoo Land and readers who enjoyed that title will likely relish this one equally. It would make an excellent book group selection.

"Anyone else here a seasonal reader? I start reading again with pumpkin spice season I garden a lot, so usually early spring I have to pretty much drop reading entirely other than books that are light and fluffy and easily enjoyed as audiobooks. Just not enough hours in the day. I have a 300 square foot veggie garden and a 150 shrub rose garden and then a bunch of annuals and perennials I start from seed.

Unfortunately, had some plant orders come early this spring, so I left off half way through several books with several series part finished which now have new books. 

I'm really frustrated now though because I was a third of the way through Brandon Sanderson's Way of Kings and now I don't remember how the world works at all. I left off with like 70ish pages of the last book in the Skyward series. I finished the first book in Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis series but still have book 2 and 3 sitting.  I'm part way through Pratchett's book Sourcery. About 22% through War and Peace. 

Anyways, looking forward to getting all my partial reads done. Skyward and Sourcery will be the books I knock out first. After that I need to decide whether to try to find some cliff notes type things for what I've read so far of Way of Kings OR just start over. Same with War and Peace, probably just read a brief synopsis of what I've read so far and then move on. Xenogenesis will be fast reads, so I'll probably read those as I need breaks from Way of Kings and War and Peace..

Anyways, I hope somebody else is in the same situation, trying to figure out where in the world they left off to start reading again. lol

"The Grapes of Wrath - finishing the assignment 30 years late This book has been on my TBR list since about when a co-worker recommended East of Eden to me around 2006.  It boosted up that list after I read The Four Winds and thought, ‚Äúman, I wish I would have actually read The Grapes of Wrath when it was assigned to me in high school‚Äù.  When I mentioned to a friend that it had been assigned and I hadn‚Äôt read it, they couldn‚Äôt believe I could remember any of the books I was assigned.  I was not appreciative enough to my phenomenal English teachers at my big public high school.  I know I was an arrogant little shit when I was in HS, but I hadn‚Äôt connected my not reading powerful works like this to it.  Would I have been a more empathetic person as a teen had I read this?


The issues of the book are still relevant today. Rampant economic equality, the unfair hypocrisy of employers colluding on wages yet using state violence to squash worker organization, the abysmal treatment of homeless people and migrants.  While I was growing up in an economically comfortable suburb, there was never money left over, and I knew I was going to have to pay my own way through college.  I am in a much better economic situation now, yet I feel like I am more moved by the plight of the Okies than I was.  I am the reverse of the idea that people get more conservative as they age.


While I feel reading this book has been important to me now, I am disappointed in myself 30 years ago for not reading it.  People ask for advice they‚Äôd give their younger selves?  Mine, today, is: do the damn reading.",normal

"I just finished Hemingway's 1929 novel ""A Farewell to Arms"" today, and I'm absolutely blown away. As much as I enjoy reading, books don't usually leave much of an emotional impact on me, but this was definitely an exception. In my opinion, this book was beautifully realistic. The characters were not perfect or great people, but were relatable and interesting; I really felt like constantly wishing the best for the main characters, during the best and worst of times.

The writing style stood out to me a lot too. To me, this book's writing style feels less like normal pose, but more so actual verbal narration. It's like Hemingway sat down to record his voice telling a story, and transcribed it to text. So it has this especially immersive and understandable feel to it. Fredrick Henry's thoughts and speech feel genuine and relatable to me because of that.

However, this was probably also one of the saddest books I've ever read. With various characters who you truly wish the best for, they often end up horribly. The last few chapters of this book got me really choked up, and the ending was incredibly haunting.

While I've liked what I've read from Hemingway (I've looked through his short stories, and read The Old Man and the Sea), this for me was incredibly powerful. It's probably my second favorite novel, just behind ""Les Miserables"".

What are your thoughts on this book? I really want to hear what you all think about this classic!",normal

"Thoughts on The Last Word, by Taylor Adams? Never read anything by Taylor Adam's before. I picked this up on a whim, and ended up really loving it.

I think the writing itself was pretty good, and I love how many twists there were in the story.

I really thought I had it all figured out, and while some of my predictions were right there were so many things I didn't anticipate. 

I think Emma as a character was great, and seemed realistic. I loved that she was kind of antisocial, and her relationship with Laika was adorable. I was also a big fan of the fact that she wasn't a character who was scared of dying. I thought that made the struggle throughout the story more interesting. 

Would love to hear from others who have read it, or others who have read anything by Taylor Adams. I'm debating on picking up other books from him, and would to know if all the books are similar to The Last Word.",normal

Over the last several weeks/months we've all seen an uptick in articles about schools/towns/states banning books from classrooms and libraries.

"Anyone else absolutely HATED Brave New World because of the language used? A few months ago I finally finished reading the book and I absolutely hated it. I am a native English speaker, and I like to think that my vocabulary is quite extensive. I recently started reading literature to expand my vocabulary. What I like to do is to write any word I do not know or understand and then study it later in Anki. Brave New World was almost impossible to read because every single page had 3-4 words which I never in my life seen anywhere. It almost felt like the Huxley was doing it on purpose. 

Just a few examples, out of I think 500-600 I found in the book: gaudily, precipice, solecism, waylay, perennially, indecorum, becalmed, surreptitious, boscage, indefatigability.

Some words are used in such a strange manner that it almost feel like Huxley was on purpose confusing the reader.

"‚ÄúWhen Breath Becomes Air‚Äù ethics Recently finished Paula Kalanithi‚Äôs book which I thought was beautiful. It‚Äôs not a spoiler to say the author writes about his experience as a neurosurgeon preparing to die. The book is deeply philosophical regarding finding meaning in life and death. 

It may be a bit of a spoiler to share that the author and his wife decide to have a baby after his cancer diagnosis, aware that he is likely to die but not knowing when. For an author so deep in his exploration of philosophy and ethics, I was surprised he did not discuss more about the consequences to his child at being born to someone unlikely to live long. He does discuss his concerns related to how this will impact him and his wife. 

Do you think this was a blind spot for the author? Or perhaps too painful to approach? Or a mere artifact of the author passing before his book was complete?",normal

"Some Characters Are Written To Be Controversial/Repulsive I‚Äôve returned to the dystopian genre as I do every couple of months and once I read a book, I go to book review sites to see what other people thought.

A character could be written with wrong views and it‚Äôs supposed to remake you stop and think something is wrong. Just because they‚Äôre the protagonist doesn‚Äôt mean their world views are correct. Wait for the character development or not; nothing wrong with a villain as the protagonist.

"‚ÄòWhat Remains‚Äô by Carole Radziwill I went down the rabbit hole recently after reading **11/22/63** by Stephen King, and wanted to learn as much as I could about JFK, and his family history. I found I was really connected to how his death affected Jackie Onassis, and of course, was moved by the photo of John Kennedy Jr. as a child doing a salute at his father‚Äôs funeral.

So I eventually came to understand the man that little boy grew up to be, which ultimately led me to the story of his death. 

When I looked up books about his plane crash, I discovered the memoir by Carole Radziwill, who was JFK Jr.‚Äôs cousin by marriage. She was really close to him, and was best friends with his wife Carolyn. What I didn‚Äôt know was that her story was not just about John and Carolyn‚Äôs death, but how she lost her husband three weeks later after a five year battle with cancer.

Let‚Äôs just say, I was a complete wreck by the time I finished her book.

Radziwill was a former ABC News producer, so what we get is a remarkably well written, devastating story that proved to be one of the best I‚Äôve read in the past few months.",normal
"Sally Rooney's Normal People: chronicle of a failed read. What did I miss? I was trying to read something different.

I have read entirely too many stories of tentacle monsters, bad scifi and fantasy, spicy romance novels, tentacle monsters, a giant Chinese classic novel (which I do recommend), and also tentacle monsters. So, I had bought a copy of this a few years ago to try to round myself out a little. Finally had some time and decided to force myself through it.

And...yeah, it went over my head. The fine observation of the characters' emotions and relationships was way more than I could ever accomplish. If I were trying to write the story from personal experience, Connell would have sat in his room playing video games and studying and just dreamt about Marianne, who would have never noticed him and just thought he was some weird loser in her class. (Which, obviously, would not have won any literary prizes, or likely been published.) I never *had* the circle of friends these characters did in either high school or college, so I couldn't really relate; I had no reputation to lose, just a few friends here and there, so when Connell talks about Marianne being punished reputationally for Jamie's sins I had to take it on faith.

What I *can* tell:

1. It's a nice example of the hourglass plot, with Connell on top and Marianne on bottom socially in the beginning and the places reversed throughout most of the book. This nicely develops the theme of class, with Connell being disadvantaged by his working-class upbringing at Trinity (which I gather is the Irish Ivy League equivalent), whereas Marianne has an easier go of it (though she still also gets into bad relationships).

2. There's a big feminist theme with Marianne being threatened and finally abused by her brother, abused by her dad beforehand, and taken advantage of by Jamie, Lukas, and everyone else she dates. Even Connell takes advantage of her before finally becoming less of a jerk (or maybe he's still a jerk and I missed that; quite possible). Ironically it ends with Connell doing a damsel-in-distress rescue of her (or perhaps this is deconstructed in ways I missed). 

3. Apparently her masochism derives from her abuse; I'm told this was somewhat controversial. Maybe Rooney is making a point about how bad kink is; maybe it's just in this particular case. (I suspect an extended sequence with Marianne discussing her preferences, picking a safeword, and receiving aftercare would not have fit the theme of the novel.)

"Reading Tracker caused my reading slump üôÉ I‚Äôve been using the app Bookly for almost 2 years now and I am realizing that it has contributed to my reading slumps. 

I have the goal of reading at least 30 minutes a day because I‚Äôm pretty busy with my twins and work. The app lets you use a timer and learns your reading speed the more sessions you do. It will give you an estimate on how long it will take you to finish the book. 

I think this inadvertently made it feel like a competition/deadline for me, so it turned me off from reading. I would feel bad if I didn‚Äôt read a lot of pages in 30 minutes. Constantly checking the timer when I‚Äôm reading. Also, It‚Äôs kind of distracting to have my phone screen on while I‚Äôm reading.

"Has anyone read Arthur by Giles Kristian? I have a burning question about the ending... I finished Arthur last night and loved it, but I feel like I don't quite understand the ending. Spoilers ahead, obviously.

On p327 Arthur sees Camelot under siege and knows  the boy is in danger, but he chooses to take a nap under a Hawthorn tree. Weird timing. 

In Celtic myth, Hawthorn trees were associated with fairies and falling asleep beneath them put you in danger of being kidnapped and taken to the underworld. 

When Palamedes wakes him the writing switches from past tense to present and they wander through fog (again, associated with being the veil of the underworld), Arthur sees Lancelot and Guinevere's ghosts/memories of them, and they stroll right into Camelot. 

At this point, I was sure he and Palamedes were dead. But later interactions with other characters made me unsure. 

I also feel like Uffa's helmet is key but don't know how.

And then, after everything, he chooses to run away with Prince Erbin/the boy. While I appreciate the redemption arc of Arthur finally being a father figure and also protecting the boy's childhood when no one protected his, I kind of feel like it was another betrayal to everyone and everything they had fought for? 

I feel like I'm on the edge of understanding the significance of the ending but not quite smart enough to get there. Anyone have any insight/thoughts? 

TL:DR: what happens at the end? I don't get it, haha.

"Becoming: Thomas Harris's ""Red Dragon"". Dove into a new series right now and just finished the first book to it. The new series is Thomas Harris's Hannibal series and the first book I've finished is ""Red Dragon"".

During his time as an FBI agent, Will Graham had risked his own sanity in order to catch Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a serial the likes of which no one has seen.

And now he is following the bloody trail of the Tooth Fairy, a killer who has committed murders of two families. In order to find him, Graham has to understand him. And to do that, there is only one place to go: inside the mind of Dr. Lecter.

This is the very first time I've read any of Harris's work, especially this series. The only thing I've ever known about the Hannibal series were the movies and the three season tv series (of which I've watched and enjoyed immensely!). But now that I've read the first book, I'm completely hooked!

This is not just a police procedural or a horror novel. It is actually both at the same time! And it is the book that introduced Hannibal Lecter to the when it was originally published in 1981.

While Hannibal does play a minor role in ""Red Dragon"" his presence never really goes away as I continued with my reading of it. He may appear and act like a gentleman and can be really enigmatic a lot of a time, but he is also a cold monster. And I will soon see the bigger roles he will play in the later books.

Reading ""Red Dragon"" is like watching an episode of Criminal Minds, and I loved every bit of it! I have yet still three books in the series that I have to read, and already I'm on the second right now. Things are apt to get a lot more interesting when I continue on with this series!",normal

"What is your favorite betrayal scene? I'm reading a book right now and just got to a part where the MC, who is in a bit of a pickle, calls up her friend and basically asks, ""Can I trust you?"" and her friend is like, ""Yeah, I got you, don't worry,"" and it seems kind of obvious that she's going to betray her. The plot seems pretty predictable at this point and I'm not sure I want to finish the book anymore. I don't mind reading a spoiled book for the craft, but the writing is just okay. Just skimmed the next few chapters and yup, she betrays her.

That got me thinking about books with good unexpected betrayal scenes. My most memorable betrayal can't even be considered a betrayal, but it really felt like it at the time, and it's in *Little Women* when >!Jo turns down Lauire's proposal!<. As an adult, it totally makes sense why she would, and it was absolutely the correct decision for both of them. 11 year old me when I read it? I felt *so* betrayed on behalf of >!Laurie!<. Grown up me knows that she never owed him anything >!beyond friendship!<, child me felt so wronged.

The most recent one I read was *Ace of Spades* by Farida Abike-Iyimide. I was listening to it while on a walk and the >!music teacher scene!< had me stop and go, ""Oh shit"". Abike-Iyimide did a good job of setting up the betrayer as enough of an ally that it felt like a real betrayal, but not so up the MC's butt that it felt like a set up for a betrayal.

"In The Garden of Beasts by Erik Larson In The Garden Of Beasts by Erik Larson (2011)  
  
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è(Very Good)  
  
What I love most about history is that so often it is wild beyond mere fiction, and for a historian to really shine, I mean really standout, he or she has to be a good storyteller. Has to be. That is one of the barometers for being an excellent historian in my eyes. Are you a good storyteller? Do you not only have your facts right, but can you make it engrossing? We live in a time where simple facts are dull. Can you give me spicy facts? Spice it up. Erik Larson is one of the best at this currently.  
  
I confess this is not the first time I have read this book, but every time I reread something, I try to look at it through a new lens. In this reread, I wanted to submerge myself with William Dodd into 1930's-era Berlin, and let Larson take me on a journey along the city. What I came away with is a snapshot of basically a single year or two (1933-1934) in which a carrier of the American ideals (Dodd) is tasked with observing the transformation of the picturesque, famed European city (Berlin) to that of a tense, paranoid, fanatical monstrosity under the tyranny of Chancellor Adolf Hitler. And for asking a downtrodden country to, um, please pay back your debts to America (during the Depression lol). Anyway, in these few years Dodd was able to witness the rise of the Gestapo, the coup of the stormtroopers, the transformation of German society to scared, maniacal fanatics, political backstabbing in the Nazi party, and progressively worse persecution of the Jewish population. A snapshot. Just a window into a few years of interactions with the terrors of 20th century history- Goring, Goebbels, Himmler, Diels, Streicher, Rohm, Rosenberg, and of course Hitler- men he would meet and rub elbows with at lavish parties, then later despise. It is well written, well told, and provides the sense of dread many Jews and Germans felt who were not aligned with the Nazi party themselves.  
  
William Dodd and Berlin's transformation make this book. Dodd is kind of an oddball for a diplomat. He is a history professor from Chicago who carries the ideals of the Jeffersonian Democrat. He isn't real skilled at statecraft. He lives frugally, and is a nerd. He isn't so sympathetic to Jewish persecution, but it is disheartening to read that there were a lot of Americans who weren't, who believed America too had a ""Jewish problem"". But Dodd is sensible and rational and stood on business in a country that had become feverishly irrational and illogical. His rented home on the Tiergartenstrasse is routinely mentioned as a safe haven for dangerous thoughts and ideas deemed radical by the Nazi regime. And Dodd was not a coward. His personal interactions with Hitler, Papen, Goring and so forth are incredible and saved his reputation despite routine sabotage from wealthy government snobs back in the U.S. Seriously, his interaction with Vice-President Papen was so fucking awesome. Read it.  
  
Where the book lacks a bit for me is the tales of Martha Dodd, William's daughter. She is obviously advertised as a main part of the story, her chapters often alternating with her father's. And there is some valuable history to be gleamed through her. But her chapters feel odd mixed in with the overall mood of the book. She is naive, flaky, thrillseeking, flirtatious- and I respect that about this woman especially in Germany, especially in the 1930's. But her character didn't really grab me, and I often felt semi-irritated by her behaviors and decisions on so grand a stage. A thrillseeking, love addicted woman in the 30's is fine, and I am more of a ""get in where you fit in"" type person. But, on such an intense political stage, her trysts with actual Nazi officials was repulsive regardless if she was being naive. And they truly hurt her father politically. I couldn't root for her. Her views from her relationships with Boris, Putzi, and Diels are valuable, but I just couldn't vibe with her.  
  
The description of The Night of the Long Knives is well done here by Larson. Again, regardless of how many times I've heard the story, if it can be retold in a thrilling manner then I want to hear it again and again. The scene of Hitler arresting a drunken Rohm, and kicking down the hotel doors of stormtrooper leaders (and in some cases their gay lovers) is just unimaginable horror. How Rohm is killed is very, very dramatic. The assaults on Americans for failing to heil, the outrageous parties thrown by Nazis and attended by Dodd, the paranoia generated by the Gestapo... the ridiculousness that is Hermann Goring (he would be so damn funny if he wasn't a terror). The Reichstag arson case- another thrilling moment. It is overall very well done by Larson, and worth reading and recording a timeline of events as I like to do.  
  
One other complaint: the tale of Anna Rath in Nuremburg. If true, this tale is vulgar and tragic to a degree where words cannot do it justice. HOWEVER, I have read a few critiques that claim this story didn't happen, and Larson put it in this book for flare. I myself couldn't find much on Anna Rath besides references to this book. If that is the case, then I take (imaginary) points away. While I want quality storytelling in my history books, I still want accuracy. Accuracy still matters, as does the truth. I won't accuse Larson overtly of conjuring up false narratives in all his books, and this book would have been excellent even without this scene. Regardless, if this story is not true I will call that out here, and advise to take the Anna Rath episode with a grain of salt.",normal

"Thoughts on *My Brilliant Friend* being named as the best book of the century by NYT?  I like to think of myself as pretty bookish. I  teach Literature, and I‚Äôve worked in a bookstore, but I somehow missed the boat on *My Brilliant Friend* until NYT published their list of the 100 best books of the century (so far). For those who don‚Äôt know, the list was based on an NYT survey of literary agents, publishers, writers, and others who work in publishing.


I picked up the book and really enjoyed it. Since reading, I‚Äôve been thinking about what makes the book special. 

For me, i think it‚Äôs the fact that the book manages to tackle such big issues in such a subtle, slice of life way. 

For example, the book tackled the issue of family roles and patriarchal structures (especially in Italy) in an extremely realistic way. >!Lila‚Äôs decision to leave school to help her family financially and, in so doing,  Give up her own dreams was hard, but  
very real. Her marriage to Stefano also was so heartbreaking and really shed light on the normalization of patriarchal structures‚Äîlarge and small‚Äîespecially in the mid-twentieth century!<

Other writers that I‚Äôve seen take on these issues well are people like Carman Maria Machado and Margaret Atwood, but their stuff is more experimental, whereas MBF is more straightforward. 

So that‚Äôs what I think may be special about the book. What do you think earned the book so much attention from the literary community? Or do you disagree with the ranking? If so, why? 

All kinds of answers are acceptable:)

"Iain Banks' Complicity is ours too. I‚Äôve been a fan of Iain Banks (that‚Äôs general fiction Iain Banks, not his cooler, more popular sci-fi twin Iain M Banks) for a few years now. I‚Äôve read what are widely considered to be his most acclaimed novels (The Wasp Factory, The Crow Road) and his deeper cuts (Whit, A Song of Stone). I would consider myself someone who enjoys his specific style of knotty family drama, subversive themes and idealistic young protagonists, framed within locations which exude a sense of place. Iain Banks‚Äô worlds feel lived in, and being familiar with many of his favourite locations has allowed me to feel incredibly immersed when reading his works. 

I recently finished Complicity and can't stop thinking about it. Complicity has burrowed its way into my psyche. Things in my everyday life remind me of it, I‚Äôve even dreamt about its more graphic scenes. I‚Äôve really been thinking about what I believe are the themes and message of the novel, the idea that we are all complicit in the evils of our society, that we shape the world around us whether we like it or not. I‚Äôve been thinking about the protagonist Cameron‚Äôs arc, and what the change of perspective and person represents in the final chapter. The implications are chilling. 

This novel is pure Banks, distilled to its very core. It works with a lot of the themes and tropes Iain liked to regularly employ. There are long diatribes about the distillery process for Whisky, even longer musings on computer hardware. Iain must have been listening to Pixies as he was writing this novel, because Trompe le Monde receives multiple mentions. Iain was an angry leftist, furious at the neoliberals which had taken control of the United Kingdom throughout the late 20th Century and who still pull the levers now, as I write this. 

I‚Äôm starting to think Complicity might be Banks‚Äô best novel. It‚Äôs almost certainly his bleakest. In the page of press quotes before the book starts, Iain wryly states in the final line that this is ‚Äúlike The Wasp Factory, except without the happy ending and redeeming air of cheerfulness.‚Äù He was right. I‚Äôve been deliberately vague regarding specific plot details here, as I think this is a novel best experienced with minimal prior knowledge.  

If you‚Äôre new to Iain Banks, read it. If you‚Äôve enjoyed his more acclaimed novels, read it. If you enjoy the Culture series, read it and I promise to finally read Consider Phlebas in return.",normal

"Holly Black's ""The Cruel Prince"" is very good. Okay, I had low expectations about this book (because the less you expect, the more you can get) and I did not expect that I would like the book very much.

In the world of the book, next to the human world, there is a fairy world hidden by fog. All sorts of magical creatures live in it. Some of them differ from people only in their ears, and some only remotely (or even not at all similar).

I liked the world of this book. He is so magical, like in fairy tales, but at the same time so cruel (magic that allows you to control people's minds scares me in general). The author explains how that magic, or a magic item works very well.

In the story, Jude and her two sisters (one of whom is a fairy) live in a fairy world. The heroine wants to become a knight and performs in a tournament in front of the royals so that they accept her as a knight. One of them, Dain (the prince who is about to become king) secretly makes her his spy (because she knows how to lie, and fairies can't do that) and now she has to keep an eye on his brother Balekin, because it seems to him that he is planning to kill him.

The book is divided into two parts: ""Book 1"" and ""Book 2"". And the plot focuses on Jude's life. About her conflicts with Cardan and his friends, about the relationship between her sisters and foster parents, and about her work as a spy. And it's done well. I couldn't tear myself away from the book because I was wondering what would happen next. The palace intrigues are done very well, and Chekhov's guns are firing.

About the characters. I like that most of them are not absolutely positive or negative characters. First, you root for this character, and then, learning something about him, you are ready to kill him, to put it mildly (>!It's about you Locke!<) or vice versa.

Jude is smart, strong, stubborn, but at the same time she is impulsive, which is why she can commit an act after which she will regret having done it.

Cardan (cruel prince) begins to play the main role only in ""Book 2"", but even so, he is not an interesting character. He's violent, but it's too much for him to kill someone.

My favorite character is Madoc, Jude's stepfather. On the one hand, he is a cruel fairy who is known for the fact that war is the best entertainment for him, his military clothes have turned red, if not black with blood. Damn, the book starts with him killing Jude and Taryn's parents. But it is also clear that he is capable of love. He loves his daughters and son sincerely. He took care of them, taught them. But he is inherently cruel, no matter how much he loves someone.

The author's writing style is good. It was easy to read and I like that when writing a book on behalf of Jude, the author does not often use the pronoun ""I"". Because of this, the book is more pleasant to read (at least for me it was). The descriptions are detailed and beautiful, especially the dresses.

As a result, I liked the book. I can describe it as: ""A fairy tale for teenagers,"" because that's how it feels, a fairy tale. It has a good plot, characters, and writing style. This was the first book where I was interested in reading descriptions of dresses. I will read the sequels, because I wonder how the author will reveal the Cardan.",normal
"What book/books do you think are funny? Just curious what books r/books community has found funny. They don't necessarily need to be comedic or intentionally funny, just books where you managed to have a lot of good laughs.

I read widely. Of course, A Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy was pretty funny to me. But I also enjoyed the humor in: 

Jennifer Close's Marrrying the Ketchups (a big family of people running a restaurant and the author just lands every joke she makes). 

Louise Candelish's ""Our House"" (her dry British humor leaps off the page and is helped by the almost  diabolical husband who does so much terrible stuff that his 'Im-still-a-good-guy-though' mental gymnastics just makes it even funnier)

"Have you read the Ring series by Koji Suzuki? I finished it recently, and it was a wild ride! (mild spoilers) (My first post on thus sub, yay! I added the spoiler flair, but I'll try not to spoil much.)

Before reading the series, like most people, I'd had cursory knowledge of Ring, the kind that pretty much everyone familiar with popular culture has. I knew there was a movie about a cursed video tape, a phone call with a voice telling you ""You'll die in 7 days"", and a creepy girl crawling out of TVs. I'd also seen one of the American versions many years prior, but had almost no memory left of it.

But then I was suggested the book series (I'd been reading a number of other Japanese authors, so it felt fitting), and boy, there were a lot of revelations!

* First, I was surprised it was a 3-book series: *Ring, Spiral* and *Loop*. Fun fact, most movies are either based on *Ring*, or use their own unique stories. Some are partially inspired by *Spiral*. Out of all 14 something movies, not a single one is based on the final book, *Loop*.
* The Japanese name for the first book is actually in English (or rather, it's a transliteration of the word ""ring"", so it's *Ringu* in Japanese). And it was a purposeful choice because of its double meaning (a ringing sound, and the shape of a ring). Another fun fact about that: the name of the book and the movies based on it is translated into many languages, and in many of them the name doesn't carry the same double meaning and instead focuses on one. It seems that people commonly associate the name ""Ring"" with a ringing sound (because of the ringing of the phone), but I'd argue that meaning is actually secondary, and it's about the shape first. The name ""Ring"" is directly brought up and discussed in-world.
* The names of the sequels, *Spiral* and *Loop*, focus on circular shapes even more obviously. Interestingly, *Loop* also uses a transliteration of the English word ""loop"" in Japanese (*Rupu*), but *Spiral* uses a Japanese name („Çâ„Åõ„Çì,¬†*Rasen*).
* The ringing of a phone is a lot less present in the book than it is in the movies. In fact, only specific characters get a phone call, and it happens for very specific reasons that become apparent closer to the end of *Ring*.
* The girl NEVER crawls out of a TV! Imagine my surprise that this iconic image did not come from the book (and honestly probably wouldn't make much sense in the context of the book's narrative). That image was designed for and popularized by the first Japanese movie based on the book, the 1998 *Ring* by Hideo Nakata.
* While books begin as a horror story with detective elements, and contain a lot of musings about curses, facing one's fate and fighting against it, the genre gradually shifts and expands. *Spiral* combines what seems to be supernatural with scientific elements like biology and DNA research, and develops into an almost apocalyptic story. And *Loop* is in many ways a techno-thriller and a full-blown deconstruction of the earlier story.
* Deconstruction in general is kind of a theme, starting with *Spiral*. What is presented as curses and superstition in one part of the story is examined with rational and scientific methods in another; one character's experiences turning into a story for another character to read or otherwise observe is a fairly regular motif. There are layers to the narrative and layers to the series' reality. This gets pretty mind-bendy; a lot of times, mostly when reading *Loop*, I thought ""Wow, I can't believe this is where the author took the story!""

In short, I was engrossed, and constantly surprised by this series. I wonder if anyone else is familair with it and what their impressions are.",normal

"Do you own any books you've never read or intend to read? Saw the thread about treasured books and the OP saying they had read a particular book many times, and I got to thinking that I own books I've never read. And a couple I don't intend to read. I mean books well-meaning people gave me but they're not up my alley. Or books that I got excited about at the time (when a movie came out for instance) but later regretted the purchase. And some that I had to buy for my college courses which I dropped but never returned the books. And on and on and on.

These books include Joyce's Ulysses (too hard for me, never got past the first few pages), New Moon (why would anybody think I'm into the Twilight series), Campbell's Biology (never took the course), A Million Little Pieces (questionable authenticity), King's The Shining (should have read the book before having seen the movie), and a couple of self-help books I'm too embarrassed to even name.",normal
"Which is your most treasured book that you own and why? I own a book that is kind of worthless because it's damaged, missing its front cover, and got it free in a garage sale. It was in the free pile, along with some cracked plastic cups and clothes hangers.

But it's the first book I recall that I had ""bought"" myself as a kid.

What was it called? *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.*

There were pages that made me laugh, ones that puzzled me, and ones that were deep philosophy for me:

>‚ÄúAlice asked the Cheshire Cat, who was sitting in a tree, ‚ÄúWhat road do I take?‚Äù  
The cat asked, ‚ÄúWhere do you want to go?‚Äù  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Alice answered.  
‚ÄúThen,‚Äù said the cat, ‚Äúit really doesn‚Äôt matter, does it?‚Äù

I read it over and over again, and it kept my imagination wild.

"From Here to Eternity by James Jones, anyone read it? I'm really captivated by this book for some reason. It was a little slow to start but after 50 pages of so it really began to pick up, which is good because it's nearly 900 pages long. I have seen the film a few times and enjoyed it quite a bit. I'm an old movie dork, I love a good classic. It inspired me to read the book. I am pleasantly shocked at how frank the book is with its use of language, especially foul language, I'm just not used to that from a book of its era. It makes the characters feel more alive and not like they're on some mantelpiece.  I like how Jones creates memorable characters so quickly. It reminds me of Larry McMurtry, one of my favorite modern writers.",normal
"The Secret History by Donna Tartt  OMG I LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS BOOK AND SO GLAD I READ IT THIS FALL!!!!

I asked the host at my job what her favorite book was and she said the secret history. Knowing nothing about it except it‚Äôs considered a dark academia classic. I went in and was blown away. This was phenomenal writing, world building and such a cozy read. I would read it in the car, in the Sauna, in bed, and last night I finished the last 200 pages by 3 am. 

I sort of related a lot to Richard. Being a first generation college student. I related a lot to
Him wanting to find a group and fit in. But having his own self excursions with other classmates not just his Greek life. I liked his time spent with Judy him partying and his poor lonely winter. I loved how he really came into his own during the whole story. When he realized the other 5 were the weird ones to the rest of the school and not to be infatuated with.  

Okay so the other 5. GOD DAMN IT WHY HENRY YOU GOD DAMN NARCISSIST. I loved him I hated him. I really liked the one scene when he steps in front of Camila when she gets that drink thrown on her. He was so complex and beautiful in my head. Like the smart Version of the Hulk. The ending when he loses faith in Julian. I loved how he became their spiritual divide in the end. How he haunted them all. 

Francis was a wonderful character. I liked all his interactions with Richard. Their secret moments. The author was pretty smart with having Charles in the background book 1 and comes off as this unhinged character in part 2. Kissing Camilla. The drinking problem. Him being the one to go after Henry when you thought it would be Richard. Camilla I was never really impressed with. She was treated as eye candy by all of them. Like all Richard did was kiss her and he was like marry me. Boy chill.  

Bunny oh poor bunny. He did not deserve that. I get it he was an asshole. But I did have some sympathy and empathy for him. When we find out he was broke. I looked at him different. I understood why. But he was the most sane out of them. It‚Äôs crazy to think he was right about all of them. 

Julian the professor I felt like was more involved with them being crazy. I felt like he was their ringleader. I found it crazy he jumped ship and dipped. I did like how George Orwell said he was surface level and the real professor who said it was based on said it was a betrayal. 

I want to believe the Mountain lion killed the farmer. Then it was hysteria to kill Bunny because he found out. 

Damn what a book. This needs a show to do it Justice not a movie. Really liked the book was set up in scenes.  I‚Äôm gonna read Bret Easton Ellis now to see how the other half kids at Hampden college were now.

I can probably straighten the last one by putting some heavier books on it, but I'm seriously considering returning the other two books. On the other hand, I wonder if I'm being too fussy?

"I'm reading Kiplings's Stalky & Co... thank goodness for footnotes! Actually, I'm reading the Oxford World's Classics edition of The Complete Stalky & Co (which is the stories in Stalky & Co plus more stories with the same characters that were not in the original collection). I have to say, my reading experience is much better thanks to the footnotes in that edition.

In the stories, the boys often use slang when talking to each other, and although I can follow the gist of it, thanks to the footnotes I realize that they were making jokes using quotes from books that were popular at the time but that I'm not familiar with. Most of that would have gone over my head without the footnotes. (Although I have read Frederic W. Farrar's ""Eric, or, Little by Little"", so I found it quite funny how they ruthlessly mock that book.)

Which goes to show, although I'm a big fan of Project Gutenberg and similar public domain pages, just getting the free ebook from Project Gutenberg may not be the best alternative for some classics.",normal
"is it just my close environment or are most readers female?

and when I think about it, all the people I know that read a lot are women. sometimes I see older men on the train reading, but when I think about men under 40 years old, I can't think of anyone I know that reads as a hobby and not just for his job etc..

"Demon Copperhead and its inauthentic voice While making my way through Demon Copperhead, I found it impossible to reconcile the first-person narrative voice of Damon with the realities of his being and circumstances. 

Damon is a character who exudes an ideal combination of wisdom, maturity, and innocence. He's of course, also extremely attractive, intelligent, athletic, and artistic. He tells his story with an air of sarcastic wit, without any polarizing irreverence, iconoclasm, or deep-seated anger. All the sharp-edges of male adolescence are sanded down, and we're left with little substance but a mouthpiece for Kingsolver.

Ultimately, I found Damon to be an empty vessel. A meticulously crafted empathetic vehicle to showcase the extrinsic horrors of rural poverty, foster care, and addiction. Any situational ambiguity that may reflect poorly on Damon, Kingsolver steps in to absolve him of fault. Any bleak interpretation in danger of slipping past the reader, Kingsolver is there with Damon to pander to our empathy. When circumstances devolve into the brutally tragic, Kingsolver is quick to use Damon's voice to provide levity. That way, she can quickly set up another set of heart-rending dominoes to collapse again on his head. If Demon Copperhead is ""tragedy porn"", Damon is the male lead creating unrealistic expectations for the reader.

In a sense, it's clear Kingsolver is making a distinction between depravity and deprivation. However in doing so, she completely neglects the psychological reality of how the two interact within a life of deprivation. In stripping Damon of flaws and nuance, she strips him of his humanity. If the only redeemable characters are those who maintain a Damon-like outlook in the face of such adversity, what's the point? Do readers really need to be spoon-fed empathy to detect injustice?

A lot of good things in this one, but Damon's point of view felt completely disingenuous. It really felt like an older woman writing a boy's story on every level. Thoughts?",normal
"What was your favorite ""Part"" of East of Eden? Meaning Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, or Part 5?

I just finished Part Two (meaning I've read about 300 pages) on my first read through and am absolutely loving it. I will say though, the first half of Part Two did feel considerably slower than any of Part One. There was such a momentum to the story going from the story of Cyrus, to his sons and then Cathy, it felt like I'd already read an epic over the course of 130 pages. For Part Two though, really until \[the main event between Cathy and Adam halfway through\], there was much less going on. I actually had to push myself through a few of the conversations about buying land and building the wells, but I can also see how it's likely setting the stage for much more to come.

Curious to hear what you all think of the upcoming ""Parts"" and which were your favorite and why. Given that I'm only halfway through, would appreciate if any spoilers are hidden with tags.

"Kiese Laymon's Heavy: A Story of Weight, Identity, and Truth Has anyone read Heavy book Kiese Laymon? It's is absolutely phenomenal. It's raw, honest and it's an American Story.   


Kiese Laymon‚Äôs *Heavy* is more than just a memoir‚Äîit‚Äôs a raw, powerful exploration of family, trauma, and identity. It reminds me of *Invisible Man* by Ralph Ellison with its deep dive into blackness, vulnerability, and survival.

Four key reflections from Laymon‚Äôs journey:

1. **Confronting Truths**: Kiese‚Äôs narrative is a struggle with personal truth. He speaks about abuse, emotional manipulation, and the lies we tell ourselves and others. His story forces us to question: *Are we really doing the best we can, or could we do better?*
2. **The Weight of Identity**: From hating his body to the societal pressures of being a black man in America, Kiese reveals how physical and emotional weight are intertwined. His journey through body dysmorphia and self-hatred mirrors many unspoken experiences in our community.
3. **Reckoning with Trauma**: Kiese‚Äôs honesty about generational trauma‚Äîhis mother‚Äôs abuse, his father‚Äôs absence, and his own addiction‚Äîpaves the way for deeper conversations on healing. How do we break these cycles while maintaining emotional resilience?
4. **The Power of Writing**: His writing style‚Äîdirect, introspective, and unapologetically Southern‚Äîcalls out to our own experiences. Kiese reminds us that writing is not just for ourselves, but for those who come after us. It‚Äôs about speaking our truth, even when it‚Äôs uncomfortable.

*Heavy* is a book that demands more than one read. It‚Äôs a call to reflect on our own lives, our own heaviness, and the stories we‚Äôve yet to tell.

Have you read *Heavy*? How did it resonate with you?",normal

"Book Review: The Deep by Nick Cutter Book Review: The Deep by Nick Cutter

Mixed reviews. 

‚ÄúThe Deep‚Äù starts with an incredible sense of dread and atmosphere. The story, set in a world ravaged by a mysterious disease known as the ""Gets,"" takes us deep beneath the ocean into a research lab where unsettling horrors await. From the outset, Cutter successfully builds tension and unease, leaning heavily into Lovecraftian horror, where the unknown is as terrifying as what is revealed.

One of the book's standout elements is its oppressive atmosphere. The claustrophobic setting‚Äîmiles below the ocean surface‚Äîcombined with the isolation of the few remaining characters gives the novel a haunting quality. As the characters descend deeper, the terror intensifies, amplified by the eerie mystery of the black honey produced by the bees. This bizarre, nightmarish detail lends a surreal, almost grotesque quality to the story, making it feel otherworldly in a truly unsettling way.

However, while the atmosphere is strong, the story's delivery falters, especially toward the end. The narrative starts to unravel as it reaches its climax, and the final reveal feels disjointed, leaving more confusion than closure. What began as an intense psychological and physical horror doesn‚Äôt quite live up to its promise, with the story's momentum dissipating just when it should be peaking.

Character development is another mixed aspect of the novel. Luke, the protagonist, is well fleshed-out, but his development feels somewhat stunted by the overwhelming horrors around him. His relationship with his brother and his guilt about his past are intriguing but never fully explored to their potential. The fate of the dog, LB, also deserves attention. While animals in horror often serve as emotional touchstones, LB's fate feels more like a manipulative plot device than a meaningful moment, leaving me unsatisfied and even frustrated by how it was handled.

The Lovecraftian undertones were my favorite part but they didn‚Äôt truly deliver. The unknown, the uncontrollable, and the sheer madness that seems to lurk beneath the surface give the novel an unsettling vibe that fans of cosmic horror will appreciate. Yet, at times, it feels as though the book relies too heavily on these familiar themes, and Cutter struggles to break new ground. The constant hints of something larger, more ancient, never quite pay off in a satisfying way.

‚ÄúThe Deep‚Äù is a mixed bag. Its atmosphere is top-notch, filled with dread and darkness, and it delves deep into themes of isolation, fear, and madness. But the uneven character development, a somewhat unsatisfying conclusion, and the occasional over-reliance on Lovecraftian tropes ultimately keep it from being a standout in the horror genre. Still, if you‚Äôre a fan of deep-sea horror and cosmic dread, there‚Äôs enough here to warrant a read. But I would encourage you to read The Troop instead. I enjoyed that far more.

"Men Without Women I'm not sure why Murakami gets so much hate on this when it's kinda expected that he's horrible at writing women. Misogyny is there in some parts, but I feel like since he writes about men having sex with women outside of marriage it is also fair for the women to do the same.

First story was just woman driver vs man driver but also it wasn't inherently sexual towards the end. I found it entertaining to see the guy just accepting how it went. I expected him to try sleeping with the woman driver but surprisingly nothing happened. 

Samsa and Scheherazade felt too dystopian and downright repulsive. Maybe it's because I haven't read The Metamorphosis. idk.

Men Without Women I fail to grasp what was the point of it other than a man who has a thing for using sailing reference.

Kino, Yesterday and An Independent Organ felt like they were decent and I see no misogyny in it. I especially liked Kino with the cat being involved. 

A question to the ladies: Wouldn't it be retribution for that Dr Tokai to die because of him being lovesick towards a woman? Since he sleeps around with multiple girls to begin with. Why do people see it as ""demonizing"" the woman?",normal
"What is a book trope/genre that you sincerely wish to end? I‚Äôll go first. Mine is female authors constantly rewriting American Psycho/Lolita from female perspectives or basically recapitulating Gillian Flynn‚Äôs books, while their protagonists are not as dynamic or interesting as Patrick Bateman, Humbert, or Amy Dunne. Basically BookTok‚Äôs genre of ‚Äúfemale manipulator‚Äù books.

Prominent examples are Tampa, Boy Parts, Bunny, every Ottessa Moshfegh novel, Animal, A Certain Hunger, Death of a Bookseller, Maeve Fly, etc. We get it. Your female protagonist is a serial killer, rapist, pedophile, or some other type of disaffected psychopathic narcissist going against the grain of males being the psychos.

"The Old Kingdom series by Garth Nix (I call it the Abhorsen series) I have had the pleasure of reading the Old Kingdom series this year.  To be honest I have no idea what to expect when initially approaching it. I thought it was just another standard state-of-the-art fantasy bildungsroman coming of age story. Not to mention that I thought Sabriel was a male based on the book cover.  However, I was thrust into the kingdom of Ancelstierre having to pick up a pawn the different magic systems of charter magic and free magic.  I found that you need halder is a wall which separates not only two kingdoms but how the magical influence of one Kingdom affects the other. I like how we are kind of thrust into the action by having her dad sent a message for her to find him. She then has to cross the border, become reacquainted with using the bells in order to go into the different precincts of death, having to go to the Abhorsen's house where she meets Mogget (who takes on the form of a cat), gets served by Sendings, then takes off on a Paperwing .  She then revitalizes Touchstone who was really a member of the royal family from centuries ago, eventually finds her father in death, confronts and defeats Kerrigor.  

 I also like the direction they went in the sequel ""Lirael"", where the titular character is struggling to figure out why she is different from her peers by not the Sight yet and also try to find her and role in Clayr society.  I do like how she is regulated to the library, finds the disreputable dog, accidentally frees the Stilken and defeats it, and is sent on a journey from the Clayr's glacier.  I also like the introduction of Sabriel and Touchstone's son Sameth and daughter Ellimere and Sam's friend Nicholas Sayre.  I like how Sam and Lirael's paths eventually cross (one of my favorite scenes was when Lirael had to lie about her age).  There was no major battle at the end for ""Lirael"" but I do like the revelation of her identity in the end.

As I'm making this post, doing talk to text (not to mention you cannot talk-to-text the proper nouns of this series), there is no way I can remember and cover all six books in the series as they are not the freshest in my memory and I've read other books in between the books in this series . However, I do remember snippets of each which I like. I like how at the end of abortion, everyone unites and gives part of their power in order to defeat Orannis, though Mogget and the disreputable dog have roles to play too.  I consumed ""Clariel"", the prequel story of the tragic figure who would later become Chlorr.  I heard a fair amount of fans of the series may not like this book and find it to be the weakest. However I found it to be quite interesting and though it is a bit of unrealized potential as we could have went a lot deeper with how things turned out for Clariel, like when did her frustration with having to conform and her suddenly obtaining the free magic creatures eventually corrupt her?  Like what was she up to for those hundreds of years and when did she be come the Chlorr of present day?  I do like how in ""Goldenhand"", they introduced Ferin and the dynamics of all of the different tribes.  Lirael plays a major role as she reunites with Nicholas, finds the identity of her mother, and goes deep into death where she confronts Chlorr and frees Clariel.  Personally, I think Lirael would have been better suited with Sam, but of course that's not going to happen due to the nature of their relationship.   However the strong, friendly familial platonic friendship that those two have are one of my favorite relationships in the book.  ""Terciel and Elinor"" was a fine book but not the most memorable; it was a serviceable prequel as it reveals what Sabriel's parents were like and what they went through.

What do you think of this series?",normal
"A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin  I have recently read ""A Wizard of Earthsea"" by Ursula K. Le Guin.  I can see the merit in the book and why it deserves its accolades. It is a unique coming of age story like everyone says. One thing I do notice is that it's not very typical. Yes, it does move the protagonist (Ged)  around a lot, surprisingly at the beginning of the story as he starts on the island, taps into his power to generate fog to deter invaders, and gets passed along to a wizard to train him.  However, that wizard realizes that Ged needs to begin the more structured programming to realize his potential thus sends him to a wizarding school. I can see where the inspiration for Hogwarts from Harry Potter comes from.  Of course that sequence where he casted a strong magic spell to supposedly raise the dead and heavily backfired, all in the name of trying to one up another peer. Not to mention it resulted in the loss of life and sacrifice of one of the head masters of the school. Then he spends the rest of the book trying to rectify his mistake as he travels across the world.  One thing I do like is that the exposition that is introduced it is not fully explicit. It is gradually hinted at here and there and it makes one pay attention, infer certain things, and eventually figure it out. He does find situations where he bites off more than he could choose such as when he almost gets tricked by that one girl in order to activate the magic stone. It has to take on the form of a hawk in order to escape and then return to his old mentor.  Before that sequence of events, I liked how he began taking smaller humble odd jobs across the land, such as providing protection from the Dragons. But then he realizes that they need to be addressed accordingly before he can move on and he call that Dragon's bluff and says the Dragon's name . I like how he begins to face the shadow creature, starting to turn the tide on it and have him doing the chasing instead of being chased by the shadow itself. I do like how he reunites with one of his old friends in order to take on the shadow creature at the end together. I do like how it is not something giant climatic battle but just a matter of outsmarting and finding one's true identity and rectifying the actions of once past.

This is a Reddit post, not an academic essay. I am not going to excuse my occasional lapses in grammar or my paragraph structure. This is all talk to text. I know I do not go into much detail regarding all the specific characters and locations. I do not remember them all because I read several books right after this one

Based on my experience posting in previously posting on this subreddit, apparently it seems to be a cardinal sin if you do not fully understand and appreciate a book the first time you read it. You are not allowed to find something confusing or be lost.  Well I am secure enough to admit that there were times where I was lost or confused when reading this book. The author's writing style is unique, but I do how technical her prose, word play, exposition, and descriptions are.  Like I mentioned before, it is all these nuances which establishes her identity as an author.  It's not just storytelling and info dump. There is a method to everything and she is skillfully building and guiding us long as appropriate.  Like I said before, I may not have100% I've expected everything from this book. However it does challenge me and keeps me curious. I am inclined to read other books in the series and possibly other books by this author.",normal
"please somebody talk about A Thousand Acres with me! This is a book that snuck up on me. Oddly enough, I really disliked it at first and almost DNFed it. Thought it was boring and moved slow. But 1) when it picks up, boy does it pick up, and I did want to know what happened. The second half of the book I enjoyed far more than the first. And 2) days later, I still find myself thinking about this book; it stuck with me. I went back and over some lines and sections that I liked, just admiring them. I do think it's pretty brilliant as far as modern retellings go. And I love Shakespeare, so a modern reinterpretation of King Lear was just very engaging for me to read.

There were some serious WTF moments in the book that I'd love to hear people's takes on!! Very rarely when I read books do I literally gasp out loud or have my jaw drop and it happened a couple times with this one! And I have no one to talk about it with!!!! :) Spoiler text but here they are below:

* >!When it was revealed Rose had also been having an affair with Jess. And not only that, but the way she unapologetically took ownership of her selfish actions/nature when she told Ginny that she knew Ginny had also been sleeping with him and that Jess would keep seeing her, Rose, because he loved her, not Ginny. On the one hand, I found myself (only a little bit) respecting her accountability and honesty about her own character. But on the other hand, my god that was cruel and a betrayal and just... the matter-of-fact way she said it was so callous. And also, there is something despicable and slimy-manipulative about doing something terrible to someone you love and has always been there for you and saying ""well that's just who I am and what I'm like, you know me, and look I'm admitting it and taking accountability so \* shrug \*"" as if it somehow justifies it. Also it was just so... weird! And extremely weird and messy of Jess.!<
* >!When Ginny made the poison sausages and sauerkraut. I don't even know what to say, I just want to talk to someone about it!!<

And I just wanted to share a couple quotes I really liked:

>Forgiveness is a reflex for when you can't stand what you know.

And:

>""Most people would have said she was rather plan. Square and solid, rather a long face. She was transformed by love.""

>I¬†glanced at him sharply, to see if he was making fun, and he caught my look. He said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not joking. She had beautiful eyes and nice teeth. When we were making love and other times, too, when she was very happy and excited, the expressions on¬†her¬†face made it beautiful. She could also be very graceful if she wasn‚Äôt thinking about¬†her¬†body or feeling self-conscious about it. We worked¬†together¬†at¬†the crisis¬†center.¬†I¬†watched her for a long time before I fell in love with her. There was plenty of time to notice.""

>""That's the homely woman's dream, you know. That someone will see actual beauty where others never have.""

>""I know.""

  
And:

>It was terrifying to think of myself as so obvious, so transparent. I remembered just then how my mother used to say that God could see to the very bottom of every soul, a soul was as clear to God as a rippling brook. The implication, I knew even then, was that my mother could do the same thing.

  
And:

>Without speaking, he drew everything out of me. And after it was over, I knew I was somehow at his mercy.

"What do you guys think about Rich dad Poor dad?  My father is making me read this book and I already went through half of it. I am absolutely bored.

Every single one of the ""precious"" advice that made the book famous are just the simplest or stupidest things I've ever read. Like, when the autor says that poor people are poor because they are slaves of their own money and don't become rich because of their fear of losing all of it, I get mad. Poor people are poor for many reasons, most don't have a single cent to spend on assets, they are worried whether or not they will br able to aford their next meal or have a roof over their heads.

Also, he says that, to be rich your income has to be bigger than your expenses. To me, that's obvious, basic math, however, poor people don't get to choose that, even if they try to save. Also, in any moment (up until where I have read) he explains how to become richer, he just says ""you need to gain more than you spend and use the leftover money to get more money"". But. how. 

I am middle class, I am absolutely not rich but live confortably, and this book is pissing me off a little with it's insensitiviness with poor people and absolutely obvious advice. And I also find kinda ridiculous that this man had to tell a fake history of his past to prove his point. Don't get me wrong, I do think that ""money intelligence"" is something very important and am interested in learning more on this subject for my on good, it's just that this one book in particular doesn't seem to be teaching me very much. 

However, maybe all this is caused by my taste in books. Normally I just read fantasy, so I think this is really not mt cup of tea.

"Halfway through The Shining. Have a question I'm halfway through, right before the first big snowfall occurs (I assume). Please no spoilers! (if there is anything to spoil given what I'm about to say)



Maybe it's just because the book/movie has been out for so long that everyone is generally aware of what the story is about, but it feels like overall the book is literally just 90% foreshadowing. Jack with anger issues and a drinking problem and danny seeing violent visions and the overlook being the site of a handful of grisly deaths and it being cursed, etc. etc. Hmm I wonder what's going to happen here?? Feels a bit odd like there's supposed to be a ""twist"" (and maybe there will be?) but all in all I feel like I generally know the direction it goes in. Still a really good read though.

  
But my main question is: is ""REDRUM"" supposed to be a mystery? Obviously Danny doesn't know what it means and is intrigued by what this word means, but it's pretty clear that it's murder backwards, which goes in line with the stuff about the very obvious foreshadowing. Is the audience supposed to be mystified as to what REDRUM refers to? Or is it supposed to be this strange dynamic where the audience knows exactly what it means but we're supposed to watch as Danny ponders it and tries to figure it out?",normal

"The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving.

Hey everyone, **the chairman of the FCC, is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd.** Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services. ISPs shouldn't be able to favor their own e-readers or online book services over others. the Internet is a massive public library. We cant allow the FCC to give Comcast control over it.

**[But there‚Äôs still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won‚Äôt act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

"Unpopular opinion: leaving negative reviews on books because they contain triggers or themes you don't enjoy is wrong and unjust. I have just finished a trilogy and went on Goodreads to express my thoughts and appreciation. I did skim through the reviews to see what others thought of the books, as one does when stumbles onto the biggest book review site. What I have found is that people leave one star reviews saying *""it has sexual slavery in it"" ""it has rape in it"" ""it has lots of mention of gay sex in it""  ""it contains dubious consent""* etc etc. so it contains what is otherwise known as **triggers** in it. Now, this series' description is quite clear that it has mature content, it has slavery and that this is an enemies-to-lovers, fantasy with M/M romance in it. So assuming one doesn't blindly grab books from the bookshelf/download random stuff to their e-reader it is safe to say that readers are well aware of the summary before diving in, thus giving themselves and the writer consent to deal with and read about such unpleasant or out-of-the-ordinary themes. 

If you know you are sensitive to slavery then why do you choose a book that has it as a main plot driver then go online and moan about it? Nobody forced you to pick this story, nobody forced you to keep on reading. It's like knowing you don't like milk in your tea, but ordering a milky tea then complain about not liking it. Or if you are not sure whether you like milk in your tea and you want to be adventurous and order one, then realise after a sip that this is not for you, you can just leave it and have one made in a way you know you enjoy. Not forcibly slurp it up then go complain about it. 

Leaving negative reviews because, let's say, the writing style is not up to your standards or you find the story boring or the characters one-dimensional, that is fair enough and when you see thousands of people saying the same thing chances are their opinion has merit. 

What really grinds my gears that when it comes to less-known or rising writers working with indie or small publishing houses these, frankly undeserved reviews can cut deep. It will only encourage writers to put themselves in a carefully constructed box of mainstream, acceptable themes and stories, and that is pretty much the death of artistic freedom for the sake of what? Political correctness? If we know anything about human history is that it is full of suffering, struggling, pain and bravery in the face of adversity; all of these include and caused by things modern societies view as triggers. I don't want to live in a world where books are being censored or cleansed for the sake of enlightened modernism.

Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors. That's you, Montag, and that's me.""",normal

"I feel like an idiot. I vastly misunderstood how a library card works for years. So, I was talking to my wife and the subject came to library cards and how she had one. I mention I didn't really see the point, if I'm going to pay for a book I'd rather own it, I say. She gives me a strange look but just brushes the remark off.

Later, somebody is talking about libraries on reddit and how they are so great. I said that, while the selection is great, amazon is much better.

""Yeah but you have to pay for them on Amazon""

And thats when some gears started turning. 

So I started looking into it. Turns out, for years I've always, mistakingly, though that, while the card was free, you had a rental fee to pay whenever you rent the books. I always figured that if I'm going to pay a fee to rent them, I would rather pay a little extra and keep them without worrying about late fees. Saves money, can read at my own place, and has led to a respectable book shelf.

Turns out I was wrong. So so wrong.

I had no idea the books were free. I went to the library the very next day and got a card. Then I find out I can rent the books online and have them delivered to my kindle!

"The reason people don't shop at bookstores: The first Jack Reacher book is $17 at Barnes and Noble, while the exact same book is $7.99 on Amazon I'm a lifelong reader and lover of bookstores. When I'm out with my wife and she's shopping at a seemingly endless stream of clothing stores, I find the nearest bookstore I can -- which isn't always easy -- and lose myself in the stacks. I also buy a lot of books, a dozen since July on Amazon alone. So I have a pretty keen sensitivity when it comes to relative pricing. 

I'd like to buy more books from brick and mortars, but the business model for physical bookstores just isn't feasible anymore. They rarely have what I'm looking for in stock, and when they do it's often more than double the price I can find for the same book online. The store can often order the book for me, but their delivery times are often longer than it takes me to get a book delivered to my own house, which is at times under 24 hours -- with free shipping. 

I love bookstores and will be sad to see them go. I'll miss them when they're gone. But they don't have much time left.",normal

"I'm 25 and I just read Fahrenheit 451 for the first time. I feel like I was mislead on the subject matter The way I've seen/heard it referenced it always seemed like a totalitarian government destroys books and creates meaningless entertainment to distract the masses.

In reality, it's about people getting offended over nothing and demanding the government destroy offensive media but eventually  the people get too sensitive so that the only thing left is meaningless entertainment. The parallels to today make me feel uncomfortable.

Am I misunderstanding or were most people misquoting?

"Romeo and Juliet is NOT a romance, it is an allegory about the dangers of making big decisions based on emotion alone It's not a tragic romance about true love- it's a warning not to let yourself be ruled by your emotions alone.

The parents are ruled by a grudge preventing the happiness of their children and causing violence and death in the town they live in because neither wants to forgive the other. Like, their *unnamed* grudge causes fights to break out in the streets, causes deaths of people who have nothing to do with their grudge. You could make the argument that the fact that no one can name what caused this animosity, that it must not have even been so terrible, and they are holding onto it all out of pride.

Romeo is introduced to us by saying how he wants to *kill himself* because his romance with Rosaline ended, then immediately falls in love with the first cute chick he sees that same night, implying that he falls in love easily- that he is more in love with being in love than anything else. This is further exemplified by the fact that, unlike with many of Shakespeare's couples in other plays, we really don't get a chance to see either Romeo and Juliet as individuals with their own personalities other than ""in love"". Romeo, what about Juliet do you love so much other than her appearance? Anything? Wit? Kindness? Determination? What, other than appearance, makes her worthy of your obsession? He never takes the time to praise anything other than her surface qualities.

Romeo allows his obsession to shut down any thought of the potential consequences in eloping with Juliet. This is seen by how cluelessly he responds to Tybalt on encountering him, post marriage. He doesn't even behave rationally, just thinking: Well, I love Juliet and she loves you, therefore we're buds now.

As for Tybalt, his failure is giving in to blind rage, provoking a fight between himself and Romeo, which results in Tybalt's death.

Mercutio is pissed cuz he knew all of this needless fighting and death was based on these two families being made up of absolute drama queens all worked up over some straight-up bullshit and that *none of this had to be this way,* but because Romeo is his himbo friend he goes ahead and gets murked trying to keep his buddy from killing himself. This is why he dies like: ""For the record, you guys' families are toxic af. Bleeehhhhh...""

Finally, if Romeo had given a moment to think about *anything at all* in the crypt (self-reflection, analyzing the damage this family grudge has done to everyone, commentary on the crypt's interior decor) rather than *immediately making decisions based on his powerful emotions* neither Romeo nor Juliet would have died.

Stop teaching Romeo and Juliet as a romance. Especially to teens. Teens are *often* influenced by their emotions into making knee-jerk decisions that they often come to regret or have dangerous consequences. They *need* to hear the allegory as it was intended to be taken.

&#x200B;

Edit: no, I didn't *just* realize this. I am frustrated because as a librarian that works with teens, I have heard this is how it's being taught to them, and when I was in high school I was also taught to interpret it as a sad love story about true love. I am frustrated to hear that it is still being taught this way by at least some teachers.

&#x200B;

Edit edit: I did not add the spoiler tag. No clue why it's there, but meh.

&#x200B;

Edit the 3rd: Some of you guys are thinking I see this as my raison d'etre or that I'm rabidly angry about this, but really it's just an annoyance. I ended up really liking Shakespeare in college but the way Romeo and Juliet was taught to me in high school had left me feeling frustrated and angry and I just assumed it was because I must not like Shakespeare. So I missed out on really enjoying his works for years because I assumed that my frustration was with Shakespeare's work, rather than my teacher's interpretation of it. ",normal

"10 years ago I was the type of person to always have a book in their hand, on their nightstand, in their bag - I was reading upwards of 20+ books a year. Somewhere along the line the internet completely overtook my reading hobby. After a few years of almost no reading at all, I'm finally back in! I'm sure there aren't many who actually care, but I'm feeling good so I thought I'd share! 

Growing up, I was the biggest bibliophile. I'd read whatever, whenever, wherever. My favorite past time was reading, and my second favorite past time was finding new books to read. I'd devour whole books in one sitting, whole series in one week. I had a genuine, unrelenting passion for words and I did whatever I could to consume them. 

I don't know what happened, but somewhere along the line my phone/the internet/social media slowly inched its way into the space which once held my desire to read. My attention span got to the point that even when/if I did try to read a book, I couldn't make it past a page without having to put it down and do something else. In the past couple of years I've read only a very small handful of books - some of which took me months or even the entire year. I've had years pass without picking up a single book, despite having hundreds at my disposal. I've realised just how much social media and other electronic activities have invaded and infiltrated my life multiple times throughout the years, but the idea of doing what I once loved became scary and daunting. I'd pick up a book to try and break the cycle, but I'd get hit with the new goldfish-attention-span, or my phone would ding, or I'd sit there and re-read the same page over and over again 17 times before realising I was still on the same page. 

I think for a while there I just gave up. I didn't feel the things I used to feel while reading, I couldn't recreate that genuine desire. I resigned to the idea that the thing I used to love most was just a long forgotten chapter in an old part of my life. I stopped trying. 

But a couple of weeks ago, I decided to have a Harry Potter movie marathon for the first time in a while. I got sucked in, moreso than usual - and had an idea. Of all the times I've tried to get back into reading, I had never tried to re-read something that I used to love. I always tried the latest hits, or something I heard about somewhere. I had never thought to revisit an old love, try to rekindle that old flame by well, rekindling an old flame! So I went out, bought the first book in the Harry Potter series (one of my absolute favorites when I was younger) and decided to give it a go. I put my phone away, made myself a cozy reading area, and just decided to try it without forcing myself into the pressure of trying on a new book. 

Now I know it's still early on, but I honestly think it's done the trick. I sat down, with the idea that I would give it 15-30 minutes to start, and ended up devouring the whole book in less than a couple of hours. I loved being able to revisit this world that I used to love so much, and I loved being able to discover new things within a story I was already familiar with. It's been less than 48 hours since I started, and I'm already onto the 3rd book. That's almost 3 books in 48 hours -- which is 3 more books than I've read in the past 2(?) years! I know a lot of people have issues with re-reading books/series, I used to be one of them, but I genuinely believe that the magic and wonder of your first read can be visited again - and has the power to change you just as it did the first time around.

"I finally had the realization that it's ok to stop reading a book that you aren't enjoying. I know, this probably seems like an absurd idea to many, but I have always felt as though I have an obligation to finish any story that I begin to read, so I have been extremely hesitant to read something that I saw outside my comfort zone. I always felt like I had to force myself to finish a story that I started no matter what, which in turn stretched out the time that it took to read said books and prevented me from reading other things on my list. It was beginning to be exhausting when trying to choose a new book, due to the fact that I was worried about the time I would lose having to finish something that I wasn't enjoying.

Recently I read through the first two books of the Kingkiller Chronicles and found myself completely fascinated with the world and story, so I decided to read ""The Slow Regard of Silent Things"" in hopes to satiate my desire to get more stories within Patrick Rothfuss's universe. About 25% of my way into the book, I realized that I was not enjoying the story, but again I felt like I owed it to the book to finish it, due to my love of the original works. After forcing myself to continue for a few weeks, I finally decided that this book just wasn't for me, even though I really enjoyed the original material. I decided, for the first time, to place it on my shelf, unfinished. I was surprised at how liberating it was and have now moved onto a new book that I have been dying to read and absolutely devouring it. It's almost like knowing that I can toss a book aside if I'm not enjoying it has made me even more eager to read. It's a pretty good feeling.

Has anybody else had a similar feeling? Or do you still feel obligated to finish something once you have started it, even if you aren't enjoying it?

"I never realised that losing my love for reading was a sign of depression. Recently I have started trying to get back into reading. I used to LOVE reading when I was younger, even in the early years of high school I would sometimes just go to the library and read during lunch. And then I just stopped. 

I always told myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just too stressed with school‚Äù, ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm just in a reading slump I‚Äôll come out of it soon‚Äù, but I never got back into reading. I would try and try but as we all know, forcing yourself to read is not going to help. And then the diagnosis of depression came and even then, I still put my lack of reading to being stressed and in a slump. 

It wasn‚Äôt until yesterday when I was talking to my sister about how I was getting back in to reading again and I was nearly finished my second book in three days. 

She said ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre turning into me‚Äù. 

I wasn‚Äôt. She had turned into me, a lover of books and getting lost in the pages. I then realised that it wasn‚Äôt a slump. It was my depression that had caused my love for reading to just disappear and I think that is a valuable piece of information I want to share because it has been nearly 5 years since I really sat down and read and read and read, and now that I‚Äôm somewhat on the uphill, I‚Äôm finding my footing in the reading world again.

Edit: I want to preface that I am not implying that if you have lost your love of reading that you have depression, nor that if you have depression you will lose your love for reading. As a nursing student I know that the signs are different for everyone. I am aware that this is not always a sign of depression for everyone. I just know that if I were back in the darkest spot in my life, seeing a post like this where I can relate to what the OP is saying and feel justified in my feelings, would have positively impacted my journey to where I am. 

We are not all the same in our journeys but we are all the same in our need for justification in the feelings that we may have when in a period of depression. Many people do not feel that what they are experiencing is valid and do not feel like what they are feeling is important. Raising awareness for even the littlest of signs is the least that we can do to push someone to seek the help they need. Justifying their feelings so that they feel that their experience is valid is the most important tool in helping people to get help. 

My goal was to help just one person realise that they are not alone and that losing their love of reading is a valid feeling in the dark times in our life.",normal

""Wow"", I though, ""this AMAZING game is based on a book, must be doubly amazing, I must read it!""

Oh no, and so I have. Atlas Shrugged is a **terrible** book. It reads like fanfic. Atlas Shrugged is like ""50 shades of gray"", but for the economy.

It's a long winded love letter to capitalism, with engineers and CEOs being by far the smartest, purest and best beings on our Earth, basically Disney princesses in suits, with doves landing  on their lapels and everything.

Being an inventor or a capitalist basically means you're the world champion of philosophy, limbo and sex.

This goes for women too! Well, A woman who's equal to them in every way, except when she gets horny and requires a good tending to, you know, like a silly woman does. But only by her intellectually and entrepreneurial equal, can't have some schmo with no patents to his name caress your snow-white complexion with his rough inventor hands, looking at you with steely blue eyes.

The grand finale is some guy reading out a manifesto on a radio or something to the entire Earth, everybody sits and listens in silence for hours because that's what 80 pages of it felt like.

Why is Atlas Shrugged so revered?

**Edit:** half of the comments answer it's not revered at all, the other half are calling me an idiot for not understanding its majesty.

It's not a book about economy or capitalism because they don't work even close to what the book describes, the version of capitalism and social dynamics outlined in the book is the ""Saturday morning cartoon"" version at best.",normal

Edit #3: I want to take this opportunity to say a few things about borderline. Honestly I really don't like referring to borderline with that particular moniker, because I find it reactionary and overt and misleading. I prefer Emotional Regulation Stndrome because it's nicer and more accurate. I find my condition to be more akin to autism than something like anti social personality disorder or sociopathy/psychopathy, all the things media sources tend to group us capricious messes up with.

ERS people can and often are insufferable  under the right (wrong) conditions, which seem to be rampant in the context of our current social conventions.

 It is wrong to institutionalize us, as you watch us lose all sense and reason, using our reaction to your reaction as the means to dignify grouping us up with damaged strangers in sanitary squalor. You crumble our precarious psyches, which then become pernicious, and then the marginalization of our lives becomes the natural needed course of action for everyone in our lives, our vicinity, our perceived reality.

 It is sad and it needs to stop. Determinism is at play and the means and the end in terms of how you treat us is fucked, we do not want to become this. 200,000 men with BPD/ERS statistically will commit suicide and it breaks my heart because I know what feelings they will use as fuel.

"Sixty years ago, Harper Lee was already telling the world that #BlackLivesMatter ‚úäüèø I just finished reading ‚ÄúTo Kill A Mockingbird‚Äù and it is by far one of the best thought-provoking novels I‚Äôve read so far. It is one of those books that actually makes you think and not the one that thinks for you. The quote ‚ÄúYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view. Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.‚Äù will always stay with me.

What quote/scene from To Kill A Mockingbird is unforgettable for you?

EDIT: Just to be clear, when I said ‚Äú60 years ago, Harper Lee was already advocating for Black Lives Matter‚Äù I didn‚Äôt mean to single-out every person who had been fighting for it since day 1 or that it was Lee who first fought for it. This is my first time to actually get this tons of upvotes here on Reddit and I‚Äôm just surprised how some people could easily misinterpret what you genuinely mean. 

On the other hand, I truly appreciate all the recommendations which people said to be better representations of the long fight against systemic racism than TKAM. I‚Äôll definitely check them out.

Lastly, a lot of you were saying that if I loved TKAM that much, don‚Äôt even bother reading ‚ÄúGo Set A Watchman‚Äù because it‚Äôll definitely ruin the former for me and the characters I‚Äôve learned to love. Well, if I‚Äôm being honest here, that makes me want to read it even more. I guess I will have to see it for myself in order to fully grasp and understand where people are coming from. Also, people were saying the latter was a product of exploitation and actually the first draft of TKAM which publishers rejected hence I shouldn‚Äôt really see it as a sequel. But I beg to differ, why can‚Äôt we just see it as a study of how the novel we know and love that is TKAM came to be and how Harper Lee‚Äôs idea evolved and changed instead of seeing it as a separate novel?",normal

"What is the scariest book, nosleep, creepypasta, or otherwise, that you've ever read? I'm talking that vulnerable level of horror where you're just happy you have the lights on, but then raccoons start fighting outside and your heartbeat quadruples in a second.

Or that nightmarish quality when you're reading in pitch-black off your phone in bed, and your limbs can't be anywhere near the sides. Or you have to go to the bathroom, but can't reach two feet to your lamp because you know something is gonna grab you.

My most memorable book as such would have to be *Misery* by Stephen King. Even with the lights on I finished it with a thickening terror which didn't want me turning off the lights.

What's a book (or anything) that had a similar effect on you?

"I have read my last ever book. I recently, unexpectedly, lost my eyesight. A recent realisation is that I have read my last ever book in the usual sense. It's quite sad when I think about it given how much I love reading and even have a library in my house. What makes it worse was the last book I read was rubbish, I didn't really enjoy it at all but read it as I don't like leaving books half started. It was 'How Not to Die Alone' by Richard Roper. Had I have known I might have re-read an old favourite or tried a random new genre. I've never tried audiobooks, and I know there is a debate as to if it constitutes reading, but for me it's going to have to be the way forwards.",normal

"Currently reading Jennette McCurdy's memoir ""I'm Glad My Mom Died"". I was expecting it to be interesting - I'm blown away. There's been a lot of hype for this book, so I was expecting a more-so-than-normal interesting celebrity memoir, but what I'm reading goes so far and beyond what I expected. The subject matter itself has been talked about to death by now in the news cycle and on Reddit so I won't go into that too much - you know what you're getting into here. Instead, I wanna talk about the rest of what her book is about.

Jennette has a distinct writing voice and we learn quickly that she always wanted to be a writer since it was the one part of her life she had any control over, to the point where she wrote whole screenplays just for herself which she shared with her mother (the titular, *ahem*, well... you all know at this point).

This book has completely changed my perspective not only on iCarly (I don't know if I could honestly ever watch it again and be able to enjoy it in the same way after this), but child stardom in Hollywood in general. The abuse she went through as a child went far beyond whatever you're expecting to the point where you will probably be shocked by how underdeveloped and naive she was even at the age of 18. There are genuinely moments where I wanted to put the book down because it got so uncomfortable to read but it was so engrossing and affective, so *honest* that I burnt through half the book in just a few hours.

I know it's sold out in so many places already, but I highly, highly recommend any 90s/00s Nickelodeon fans to pick this one up (or download the Ebook) if you can. She's also working on a novel right now and I can say with confidence as I read this that I'll be checking it out.

Also just want to add that I have an incredible respect for Miranda Cosgrove now, more than I would've expected, and the chapters dealing with their initial friendship are particularly interesting when you juxtapose them with their characters from iCarly - almost a role-reversal in the real world.",normal
"The Princess Bride made me furious until I realized I was an idiot Ok, so my wife and I recently watched the Princess Bride with our kids. I loved it again, fantastic movie.  As good as when I was a child. My wife wanted to get the full experience with the book, so she bought a copy on the ol' Amazon.

It shows up. She starts reading it and realizes, ""damn, this is a long intro of some random dude."" I pick up the book, look at the author and I'm like, ""sweetie, who is this author? The author from the movie is S Morgenstein. Who is this William Goldman? Some dude trying to profit on some classic.""

This William Goldman's guy is on the front of the book, but the book I know - the book mentioned in the movie - the author is S Morgenstein. Like, what the hell is this William Goldman think he's doing putting his name on it?

It gets worse. After an intro that is like a sixth of the book by this rando, he starts interjecting in the middle of the book. Or worse yet REMOVING parts of the book and then letting us know he cut some of the story out so we wouldn't have to worry about it. Oh my gawd. The nerve on this guy.

I'm thinking, ""This idiot must have bought the rights from the estate of Morgenstein and then brutalized the book without consequence and republished it. This is the worst.""

So my wife sends the book back and buys another copy.

IT'S THE EXACT FUCKING SAME THING!!!

Surely there are some actual original publications out there right?! Without all this extra crap!!! SO we can have the ORIGINAL experience!!!

I literally pull open reddit to write this very tirade expressing my frustration and I think, ""Hold up. Who is this William Goldman?""

Turns out... it was originally written this way.

So yeah. I'm an idiot.

Edit: Well shit, it's spelled ""Morgenstern."" Ty for the solidarity those who have fallen for sneaky Goldman also. We stand in our united in our gullibility.",normal

"Sir Terry Pratchett was making fun of the hyper-sexualization of female characters in fantasy literature 35 years ago So I'm reading *Discworld* for the first time (yes I know, quite late to the party on this), enjoying it so far, but one particular passage stood out to me because it so expertly called out the unfortunate tendency of fantasy authors to overly sexualize female characters using some very clever wit and humor. I thought I'd share it here because it shows that this kind of thing has been prevalent in fantasy (and to be fair, many other kinds of) literature for a long time now.

From *The Light Fantastic* (I don't think this counts as a spoiler since it doesn't give away any of the plot, mods please let me know if I'm wrong):

> ...this particular hero was a heroine. A redheaded one.

> Now, there is a tendency at a point like this to look over one's shoulder at the cover artist and start going on at length about leather, thighboots and naked blades.

> Words like ""full,"" ""round"" and even ""pert"" creep into the narrative, until the writer has to go and have a cold shower and a lie down.

> Which is all rather silly, because any woman setting out to make a living by the sword isn't about to go around looking like something off the cover of the more advanced kind of lingerie catalogue for the specialized buyer.

And then Pratchett does communicate that this character is attractive, but he does so almost grudgingly, as though it's some kind of concession to the reader:

> Oh well, all right. The point that must be made is that although Herrena the Henna-Haired Harridan would look quite stunning after a good bath, a heavy-duty manicure, and the pick of the leather racks in Woo Hun Ling's Oriental Exotica and Martial Aids on Heroes Street, she was currently quite sensibly dressed in light chainmail, soft boots and a short sword.

> All right, maybe the boots were leather. But not black.

This book was published in 1986, so this was an interesting (and funny) glimpse into the fact that the hyper-sexualization of female characters in fantasy (which still persists today) has been around for a long time.",normal

"Ever catch yourself simply reading the words on a page without even digesting any of them? My initial reaction was to attribute it to the pernicious impact of digitalization and how it's basically eradicated my attention span (which I'm desperately attempting to rebuild by reading and reducing my time imbibing immediately gratifying content online) - however the more I think about it -  it's probably also my mild OCD, anxiety, ADHD etc doing it's thing.

Very rarely can I actually get immersed in a book, oftentimes I feel like Ron Burgundy who spoils humorous moments by bluntly remarking 'we are laughing!' - but in the context of reading I'm sitting there scanning the words thinking 'wow would you look at me reading Dostoevsky. Quite the learned individual aren't I.' and I sometimes go into a fuckin weird inner monologue that ends with a David Mitchel rant 'words don't really exist do they, they're just a collection of squiggly lines that someone gave meaning to...look at how stupid that one looks'.

It sounds a bit amusing but it's really fuckin frustrating.

Then there's the ambience of the room and external distractions, the discomfort of holding the book open, my itchy ass, not wanting to crease the spine of the book too much blah blah... I'm just disappointed with myself for struggling so much to read. I went years without much reading, and I was expecting some challenge upon returning to it, but not to this level.

Has anyone had similar experiences?

**Edit:** 

Well It appears that I'm not alone in this issue... I'm not too sure if this should come as a relief or not...

**Edit 2:** 

For the record I wasn't trying to be a pretentious bastard with my writing. If it came across that way it's because I actually went on a crusade to learn every word in the English language over half a decade or so  - I've forgotten most of them but occasionally an obscure word will slip into my writing because it's actually the first word that sprung to mind, not because I was looking up rare synonyms on [thesaurus.com](https://thesaurus.com) to prove how intelofgent I am.  

I have had a bit of fun calling girls pulchritudinous and watching them got offended before discovering the meaning of it, but overall it's been a waste of time and all it's really done is get me mislabelled as being a pompous prick when I'm not trying to be. ",normal

"""How facism works"" should be part of every democratic countries school curriculum. In my Opinion, ""How facism works"" by Jason Stanley is a book that is as relevent now as ever and provides basic knowledge on how modern facist politics threaten political discours and healthy democracies around the globe. It should be a must read in school and shows key economic problems (e.g. economic inequality, affordable education etc). and facist tatics which should be dealt with to maintain healthy democracies and identify extremist politicians.

Edit: Wow this blew up more than i expected! Through the discussion i had so far I have to admit that reading only a book from one point of view is in some way political indoctrination if the book is not sufficiently cricitally analyzed and discussed in class which is difficult as teachers may not be completely umbiased. Thus a book covering opposing views should be covered aswell to provide a full overview. However, all in all i believe reading these books are better at giving an understanding of these forms of governance  than just plain theory, films or fictional books.

"1984 made some accurate predictions but we're actually living in the Brave New World I have always been a huge fan of Orwell and 1984 and would often argue that the book predicted a lot of things about world politics correctly. However, I finally got to read Brave New World last week. And man, it is actually the true order of the world. This post is not argue which book is better. It's just an appreciation of Huxley's world-building. As per me, we're being controlled yes, but without 1984's upfront and ruthless hate. 

 I'll let this quote by Neil Postman sum it up: 

""What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.

In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.""

"Dyslexia put me off of reading. Found the Kindle App with the Open Dyslexic font and have read 13 books since June! I started with the Harry Potter series I so desperately wanted to read as a child and flew through them. I always loved books but found reading through the same page 4-5 times daunting. With this font paired with the dark mode option, I‚Äôve even read an entire 345 book in one day! 

Dyslexia prevented me from fully absorbing the material. Now I‚Äôm whisked away to whichever world I choose. I never thought I‚Äôd ever be able to enjoy reading as I do now. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful.

**EDIT: Sorry guys, it gets really busy at 6 am! 

I am aware that audiobooks exist. I listen to people talk all day. I can‚Äôt listen to two people at once. I‚Äôve tried them and I don‚Äôt enjoy them. 

There are absolutely studies that show the font DOES NOT help you to read faster, more accurately, or even help at all. This is NOT a remedy for dyslexia.

I‚Äôm NOT advertising the font as a cure all. Just stating that with MY Dyslexia it helps ME feel more comfortable. I misread words, skip over entire paragraphs, lose my place frequently, flip letters that look similar, mirror simple words, all the good stuff. I can read and read and read the same page and still feel like I don‚Äôt understand. 

Theres also more than one form of dyslexia. What makes me feel comfortable might not be comfortable for others. Is it a placebo? Probably! Is a placebo that‚Äôs made me more confident while reading? Absolutely. And I‚Äôm stil happy with that. 

What helps ME to feel more comfortable while reading is the spacing.

Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . .

History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of ‚Äúhistory‚Äù it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time‚Äîand which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.

My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights‚Äîor very early mornings‚Äîwhen I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder's jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .

There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .

And that, I think, was the handle‚Äîthat sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn‚Äôt need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting‚Äîon our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .

So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark‚Äîthat place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.‚Äù",normal

"If you're familiar with George Orwell's 1984 and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, then I think you'd be interested in Amusing Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman(published in 1985). Here's the intro: We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn't, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.
But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.

What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny ""failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions"". In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.

This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.

I would also like to plug Infinite Jest and DFW's work in general, one of the reasons I found Neil Postman. Infinite Jest is about a Huxley-an dystopian future where advertisers buy the rights to name years, therapy tries to get you to release your inner infant, and a wheelchair-bound group of assassins tries to destabilize the world by disseminating a video that is so entertaining you desire nothing else in life but to watch it.

"What's with the gatekeeping surrounding audiobooks? As I am writing this, the top post on the sub is someone sharing about their experience listening to World War Z on audiobook. They mention that they ""read"" the book, and there are a *lot* of upvoted comments telling OP that OP didn't ""read"" the book, they listened to it. Some of these commenters are more respectful than others, but all of them have this idiotic, elitist attitude about what it means to ""read"" a book. Why do you care? Someone is sharing the joy they experience while reading a book. Isn't that what this sub is all about? Get over yourselves.

There are also quite a few upvoted comments telling op that if WWZ is one of the best books they've read, then they need to read more books. There's no nuance here, these commenters are just being straight up rude.

Stop gatekeeping ""reading"" or whatever. Someone referring to listening to an audiobook as ""reading"" does not harm you in anyway.

EDIT: I am getting a lot of comments about about the definition of reading. The semantic point doesn't matter. As one commenter pointed out, an audio reader and a visual reader can hold a conversation about the same book and not realize they read in different formats. That's really all that matters. Also, when I see these comments, they usually include or imply some kind of value-judgment, so they aren't just comments on semantics.",normal

"Friendly reminder that YA books are for teenagers. Now before you jump on me, this is not an adults can't read YA post. This is a adults who read YA need to remember who YA is for post. 

I've been floating around the arc (advanced reader copy) circuit for a while. Read some good stuff, read some bad, read some meh. This past weekend I had the privilege of reading one of the best books I've had the privilege of reading in a long time. YA fantasy that was beautifully written and equal parts dark, funny and suspenseful. The teenaged characters acted authentically like teenagers, which unfortunately is incredibly rare in YA. 

Edit: For those who are interested, the book is Remnants of Atonement by G.P McKenna. It doesn't release until October, so likely only available through netgalley, but if you have an account and enjoy ya fantasy, I highly recommend requesting it. 

Today I logged on to leave my feedback and thought I would nosey around in the reviews, only for my heart to sink. Everybody seemed to agree the plot was good and the writing was fantastic, but so many people were complaining that the characters acted too much like teenagers. One reviewer even praised the plot but only gave it one star because ""it was too obvious that the characters were 15/16 years old and that annoyed me.""

Again, these are YA books. They are intended for teenaged readers. If you enjoy reading them too, that's great, but understand that. If you find teenagers annoying, go read literally anything else. You have the rest of the book store, the rest of the library. Don't complain that the 16 year old character acts too much like a 16 year old because what happens then is -because as adults we have the money - the market will continue to push YA characters who are 35 year old accountants stuck in the body of a 17 year old assassin. The list of books teenagers can relate to goes down, isolating them from their own catagory. 

Long story short, let teenagers read teenaged characters who act like teenagers. Stop isolating real life teenagers by appropriating the ya catagory when you have every other book to choose from if you don't like the teenaged voice. Support young readers by letting ya characters be kids!",normal

So, I‚Äôm going to gripe about it here. 

First off, who is this book even for? It reads like it‚Äôs written for middle schoolers, but everything revolves around 80‚Äôs references that they wouldn‚Äôt understand. I feel like I‚Äôm too old to for the book yet I‚Äôm a 90‚Äôs kid (born late 80‚Äôs). 

Second, let me talk more about the terrible writing. Nothing is implied in this book and the reader discovers nothing. Aunt and aunt‚Äôs boyfriend = bad people üôÅWade = super clever and righteous üòä Samantha = sassy and smart üòâ and Sorrento = EVIL! The characters have no nuances whatsoever. The only interesting character development was Aech actually being a chubby black girl, but from I hear about Ready Player Two (more on that later), it just doesn‚Äôt go anywhere. Overall, it reads like a book for 13-year-olds, but I just don‚Äôt feel like it was intended to be directed at 13-year-olds...?

Third, the ‚Äúlove‚Äù story between Wade and Samantha is cheesy, forced, and kind of misogynistic. Like, I thought that he‚Äôd realize that he doesn‚Äôt actually love her, he‚Äôs just crushing really hard. Maybe she‚Äôd help him understand that by saying how they haven‚Äôt even met and he doesn‚Äôt actually know her. To be fair, she tried a little bit, but her main argument was, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt love me because you don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm actually ugly!‚Äù What the fuck? The author can tell me that Wade loves her for who she really is and doesn‚Äôt care about her looks, but everything always ends up coming back around to her looks anyway. And she falls for him in the end! Why? This relationship makes no goddamn sense. It especially makes no sense because even though she‚Äôs way better at the Hunt than he is (sans playing playing a few classic arcade games), Wade still somehow becomes her white knight in shining armor. It‚Äôs gross and I hate it, and I‚Äôm a dude. Also, I can‚Äôt even begin to process how ridiculous a lot of the plot points are, like IOI not being able to beat 4 kids with their team of scholars. Wade even discovers how much info they have on Halliday, and not one person on their team, who have more information than Wade, could figure out the stuff he did?

I‚Äôm here to rant and say what I can‚Äôt to my friend so I‚Äôll be done now, but I‚Äôll make one comment on Ready Player Two. I just got it from the library, read the prologue and immediately returned it after spending a minute reading about Wade eating fruit.

Edit: Did the kid even give one solitary fuck that his home was blown up and his family murdered? I mean, he almost got killed as well.",normal

Booksellers at Barnes & Noble are really suffering right now. Other than the usual frustrations of being booksellers in the year 2021 we have also been the subject of constant abuse from customers.

3) we‚Äôre short short staffed. Like everywhere else. We‚Äôre paid minimum wage and people are going anywhere else quoting after two weeks and they can‚Äôt even hold onto managers.

"One of the most powerful descriptions of suicide I've ever read.

It‚Äôs full of spaceships, lasers, explosions . . . and of course, tentacles!!!

So, AMA! Let‚Äôs make this one interesting. Have questions about getting started as a young writer? Have questions about dragons or spaceships? Weightlifting? Warframe? Editing? Beards? Reddit? (Hey, I‚Äôm a mod over at /r/eragon) Philosophy? Puns? You ask, I answer. :D

"The audiobook I'm currently listening to, Lord of the Rings, is absolutely incredible and completely changed my thoughts about audiobooks - it contains the OST in it, voices that are either the original actors or very close replicas, and sounds from the movies. Please share your own! Here is the one I'm referring to!  It's absolutely incredible! (EDIT: Removed link per mod request)

Songs are actually sang, the music adjusts to what's happening in the story - hooves clacking, black riders screaming, sounds of water and splashes when they're ferrying across the river, fireworks from Gandalf (including the dragon), humming and singing through the songs rather than just a voice reading the verses - it's a complete experience!  The perfect combination of movie and book.

"The Animorphs were a lot darker than what you possibly remember as a kid Here are some of the spoilers you missed out on by not reading Animorphs:

Five children are forced to engage in guerilla warfare, espionage and repeated murder to protect their loved ones from alien parasites as they wait for the other, heroic aliens to finally arrive.



 When they do, the ‚Äúgood‚Äù aliens turn out to not give a shit about humans, caused the whole intergalactic war through their own shittiness and are willing to exterminate whole planets themselves to get at their hated enemies.


A child repeatedly experiences his intestines hanging out of his body while in various animal forms


A child is mentally tortured until broken and never gets better

A child in the form of a fly experiences getting splattered and smeared against a ceiling until his friends who are also flies at the time can peel his body off and take him somewhere he can transform back into a whole human before his insect mind fades completely


A child is shrunken and experiences having her eyeballs digested out of her head inside her friend‚Äôs stomach while she‚Äôs in the form of a tiny elephant


The heroes are forced to permanently imprison another child in the body of a rat because he knows too much and they abandon him on a tiny island with only other rats and garbage for company.


 Rumors circulate that the island is haunted but it‚Äôs actually his psychic screams reaching distant boaters.


A race of devastatingly powerful, violent aliens turn out to be mental toddlers who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing and are just bred to think they‚Äôre playing one big game before they‚Äôre killed at age three so they don‚Äôt learn the truth


An alien spends a few centuries hanging from the parasitic tentacle of a much bigger alien, surrounded by millions of rotting corpses attached to its other moon-spanning tendrils. They engage in mental warfare until one finally absorbs the other completely.



It turns out another seemingly ‚Äúevil‚Äù alien race is simply driven to kill and eat everything in sight because it was separated from its original world where food was continuous and the entire specie‚Äôs life is the torture of perpetual starvation


A peaceful robot willingly removes its inhibition against violence to help in the war, only to slaughter a huge number of alien-controlled humans so gruesomely that nobody dares think about or speak of it again and it is the only thing left undescribed in a book series that already describes entrails getting torn out and skulls getting smashed


A child stays too long in the form of a flea and instead of turning back into a human, accidentally turns momentarily into one big, giant flea that can only writhe and moan because it shouldn‚Äôt exist and can‚Äôt live at that scale.


The kids discover Atlantis, then discover that Atlanteans are inbred mutants who paralyze any humans they find, dissect them alive to figure out how their organs work, then stuff the corpses as kitschy museum displays for their children.


An ordinary ant gets transformed into a human child. It has no idea what‚Äôs happening and is so overwhelmed by its huge new brain and sensory input that it can only scream until it dies

1984 is great at illustrating the warning behind government totalitarianism. The characters live in a world where the government monitors everything you do.

Brave New World is a similar warning from the stand point of a Technocratic Utopian control

F451 is explores a world about how ignorance is rampant and causes the decline of education to the point where the government begins to regulate reading.

Over the past year, I've picked up over $100 worth of books for about $3 total. But beyond picking up discounted literature, your library probably does much more, such as:

-offering discounted entry to local museums/attractions

-holding educational/arts events for kids/teens/adults

-holding (free) small concerts for local musicians

-lending books between themselves to offer a greater catalogue to residents

-endless magazine and newspaper subscriptions

-free tutoring spaces (provide your own tutor)

-notary services

-access to the internet for those without, along with printing

-career services resources/ test guides

-citizenship test classes

"Teacher claims that fantasy isn't ""Literature"" Okay, so I'm a high-school student in the Netherlands. I got back into reading just a couple of months ago and I read a lot of fantasy in English (currently reading mistborn). A few days ago, I was interested in seeing if there are any fantasy classics from the Netherlands. So I looked up online, to see if there is some kind of ""Dutch Tolkien"". I couldn't find a lot, so I went and asked my Dutch Literature teacher if there is a fantasy genre in Dutch literature and if she knows of a ""Dutch Tolkien"". She told me bluntly that I shouldn't read fantasy and that she doesn't consider it to be ""real literature"". She basically thinks that Tolkien's books aren't ""real literature"".

That teacher is one of the biggest gatekeepers I know. She keeps rambling about how sad it is that kids don't read much anymore and then she literally claims that certain genres shouldn't be read. She's also one of those people who say that listening to audiobooks doesn't count as reading.

Well I'm just gonna keep reading my ""not real literature"" and my teacher can continue being an ignorant gatekeeper.

Edit: I wrote this post during my lunchbreak so I didn't have any time to respond to the comments since I was in class all this time. I'm going to discuss many of the points you guys brought up here with my teacher and I hope that I can convince her to perhaps change her views regarding fantasy.

I also didn't expect so many comments so my post isn't as nuanced as it probably should be. I wrote it right after asking her and this post became more of a rant than I intended. I don't actually think that the teacher is an idiot, but she is unfortunately very close minded.

*Keep in mind that she teaches Dutch literature in high school. I see many comments of people in the Netherlands or Belgium who have had the same experience with Dutch literature teachers, so this might be some form of Dutch snobbery or maybe it just has to do with the fact that the fantasy genre is very uncommon in literature here, so she thinks that it's only for kids. Either way, I would've expected her to be less of a gatekeeper and more of a teacher.*

To clarify about audiobooks: in Dutch schools you are required to choose a list 12 Dutch classic novels that you have to read in your 3 years of high school (if you do vwo). My teacher doesn't allow us to listen to any of these books on our list in audiobook format, because ""it's not reading"".

Another edit: wow this blew up and got way more upvotes and comments than I expected. Also thanks for all the great (Dutch fantasy) book recommendations. Apparently these kind of posts get posted very often, so I'm sorry for accidentaly making such a generic post while ranting about my Dutch teacher lol. ",normal

I just put down the book; it is still beside my bed. And I'm too excited; like, I want to suggest this book TO EVERYONE! Damn! 

Crichton originally wrote this book in 1969. And the most wonderful aspect of this book (apart from the brilliant story) is its scientific accuracy. Being in the 6th semester, we've come across almost all the topics discussed in TAS‚Äî Microbiology, Biochemistry, Enzymology, Biophysics, Immunology...and it is correct in its assessment everytime.

Another beauty is Crichton's ability to blend in fact and fiction in such a way that it would seem as if it is actually happening, in real time. At moments I held my breath for as long as 20-25 seconds.

If anybody is keenly interested in biological sciences, this is a book for them. It'll make you 'scared-to-death' (spoiler?).

"Harry Potter character: Cho Chang The discussion of JK Rowling naming the only East Asian character Cho Chang has recently resurfaced on my twitter timeline, and people seem to be angry at this representation of a Chinese girl.

Cho Chang was the first Chinese character I encountered whilst reading. I felt seen. Her name, and even the fact that she was the only Chinese girl (that I knew of) at Hogwarts, resonated with me.

"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Making a memory that will last forever. I want to preface this by saying that my daughter will be 12 in a week and is fully capable of reading herself.  

On Sunday evening I was looking through books available on my daughter's Kindle for her to download and read at her leisure when I say that ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was available for free.  I grabbed it quick and hoped that she would begin reading it soon.  Then the thought occurred to me, why not read it to her?  I haven't read a book to my daughter in years.  I read the first chapter and she was enthralled.  Having read the series myself years ago I knew what was going to happen and reading it aloud I am able to put the right inflections into the parts as they are needed.  And to say she's enjoying it is not even close.

Since that night I have read a single chapter to her each evening, sometimes staying up past her bedtime to ensure she gets the prerequisite chapter finished.  When we get to the end of the chapter she is begging for more.

As a parent I know that in the future when she is much older and has kids of her own she will think back to this time in her life fondly.  It warms my heart to know that I am making a memory that will last her lifetime and it is even more special because I know it now.

**Notes:**

\- They've only released 8 lists thus far, starting in 2014 and ending in 2020, with one year having two ""official"" list releases. I put this data together months ago, so I'm a bit hazy on the reason, but one of those two lists seemed to make far more sense to me at the time as the true list, so I just chose that one and disregarded the alternate list.

\- I hope the intro is understandable, but in case it's confusing: If a book appeared in at least 5 of 7 yearly lists, it is not penalized/lowered in rank for not appearing in the other 1 or 2. But books with 4 or less appearances are always ranked lower than books that appeared more often, even if they ranked higher on average. The number 5 may seem arbitrary, but I had to have some system to avoid outliers and that made the most sense to me.

\- The genres and page counts are shoddy. I wanted that aspect of the list to be simple so I just had one figure for each, and of course you can find a ton of different figures online. The page counts are primarily B&N, and the genres are primarily Wikipedia.

**Observations:**

\- Books by American authors appear more than twice as often as any other nationality, with 29 occurrences. Then, English with 14, Russian with 11, French with 9, and Irish with 7. 61 books are from Europe, 4 from South America, and 2 from Asia (excluding the Bible, and Russian literature since it is usually grouped separately). Nearly half of the Russian novels appear in the top 20, though - their five novels in the top 20 fall just short of the 6 American novels in the top 20.

\- 4chan validates its reputation somewhat, as the list only features three female authors, one being JK Rowling. Notable authors like Jane Austen and Mary Shelley are absent. Virginia Woolf does have two submissions though.

\- 18 authors have multiple appearances. The most appearances made by any author is a three way tie between Dostoevsky, Joyce, and Pynchon with 4. Faulkner has 3. Fourteen authors have 2.

\- By far the most popular century is the 20th century with 60 occurrences. The next highest (19th) has under 20. The oldest book is the bible (considering the old testament), and the newest is Jerusalem, by Alan Moore (2016). There are 5 books from BC.

\- The average submission (including series) is 570 pages. The lowest page counts belong to Kafka's *The Metamorphosis* with 102, and *Hamlet* with 104. and the most are the Harry Potter series with 4,224, and Proust's *In Search of Lost Time*, with 4,215.

\- The most common subgenres (besides ""literary fiction"") are Philosophical fiction with 12, postmodernist fiction with 9, and science fiction with 7 appearances.",normal

"If you are buying books on Amazon through other sellers please beware of this scam... While browsing for deals on Amazon as I usually do, I saw that ""Sapiens"" by Yuval Noah Harari was available in ""New"" condition from a Third Party seller for only $6.00 with free shipping! (Prime price is 20 bucks) What a deal! I thought, and soon after I ordered, I got that feeling of dread you get when you think that something may be too good to be true. I immediately canceled my order and looked at the seller profile. It was all caps with a name ""JAMESHALEY"" I believe, and their profile was just recently created. Their items for sale included pretty much the entirety of best sellers on Amazon. 

I did a quick google for JAMESHALEY and found a blog post detailing the scam. Scammers will open up new selling accounts, listing almost every book imaginable at an unbeatable price, knowing that due to Amazon's 1-click purchase feature, they will get a lot of hits. Of course the shoppers will cancel their order, but more than likely they will already have your Name, Address, & Phone #, which is what the scam sets out to accomplish. 

I immediately contacted Amazon about the incident and reported the seller. They sent me a swift response and even credited $5 for my trouble. So today I am browsing for books again and lo and behold, a different seller name has a great price, same situation. This is happening all over the site in different categories with more and more accounts being created everyday. So when shopping for a deal on a good book, please check the seller profile before you click ""buy""!",normal

"I hate when it‚Äôs obvious authors didn‚Äôt do basic research and it really kills the mood. I was reading ‚ÄúThe Perfect Marriage‚Äù by Adam Mitzner and there was a moment that made me say that‚Äôs not even close to correct. A lawyer was speaking to a character explaining a charge and said: 

‚ÄúMurder in the second, which is the most serious charge for murder that is premeditated but not involving a police officer.‚Äù 

And it completely took me out of the situation because I immediately went no that‚Äôs not how that works. 2nd is typically NOT premeditated which is its main distinguishing factor from 1st. The involvement of a police officer does not have any bearing on it at all. Unless I‚Äôm severely mistaken, but I don‚Äôt think I am.

Has this happened to any of you where you‚Äôve seen something obviously wrong and it just kills the mood for you?

EDIT: apparently in NY where this book is set saves 1st degree murder for really specific circumstances and then labels all other premeditated murder as 2nd so I was mistaken. I googled second degree murder premeditation before posting to confirm what I thought and all the links I got told me I was right and that premeditation made the charge first degree. I did not think to try googling NY 2nd degree, because I didn‚Äôt realize there would be a difference. I guess I suffered from confirmation bias on this one. Thanks to you guys who picked up on it!

EDIT 2: Yes I was wrong. Yes that makes this post an irony. But I won‚Äôt delete it. It‚Äôs interesting seeing the discussions you‚Äôre all having and at the end of the day it‚Äôs better to just admit I was wrong then try and hide it.

"I just finished reading The Shining. Wow, no wonder Stephen King hated Kubricks movie. Stephen King has a long history of poor adaptions, but The Shining might be the worst offender.(And yes, I've seen all of King's movies, even Dark Tower)

The Book has such warmth, such love for family, and Jack's struggle. Danny is a complex character, as is Wendy.  None of the actual scary spooky monster stuff happens until near the end...and that's brilliant. 

I know this book was near and dear to King due to his own drinking problems.  I also know authors sometimes tend to get a little heated about adaptions and it's overblown sometimes. Not in this case.

Kubrics movie, while an enjoyable watch, has lost all flavor to me after reading the book. It's liked someone ready a summary and bullet point presentation, but missed the entire point.

I finally decided to read it after watching Doctor Sleep and loving it.  Decided to read them both. I know Kings books are often pretty different than their TV or Movie Adaptions, but this one...wow.  It feels so shallow now. Jack in the movie feels crazy from the start, ready to murder his own family at the drop of a hat.

In the book, his struggle is so heartwrenching.  His desire to be a better man. To resist the hotel. Seeing him ultimately lose in the end, knowing it was coming because of the movie and Dr.Sleep of course, I still was like ""Please don't do it Jack, resist!"", I couldn't help myself.

It really touched me on an emotional level, Jacks internal monologues.  I don't drink or have kids, but it resonated with me so strongly, the feeling put into those.

Instead Kubrick made it a generic horror movie.",normal

[Here's a link to every book I've read, feel free to ask me about any book in this list if you're on the fence about it.](https://imgur.com/a/sOwySVE) PS: the link works best in browser, not thru a mobile app! 

**Science Fiction**: 

*The Three Body Problem trilogy, Cixin Liu* -- This trilogy is always getting thrown out whenever asks for a good ""alien"" or ""first contact"" book, for good reason. I dont think any other book(s) goes such in depth when it comes to character development and global politics than these. The books span from the cultural revolution in China, to many centuries in the future. 

*Dune, Frank Herbert* -- I dont think I've ever read a sci-fi book so beautifully written. From the dialogue between the characters to everything else. This book was one of those books you enjoy to actually read more for the writing style than the story itself (not that the story was bad, it wasn't) similar to the book Lolita. I loved this book and wish it was longer. 

*Extracted Trilogy, RR Haywood* -- This is a time travel trilogy where everything is very easy to follow. Its not one of those mindfuck reads where you have to do extensive mental gymnastics to keep up with the plot. You will immediately fall in love with the characters and their collective humor.

**Fiction**:

*The Goldfinch, Donna Tartt* -- I enjoyed this book more for the characters than the story itself. Boris to this day is still one of my all-time favorite book characters of all time. I dont think this book is as good as Tartt's other novel ""Secret History"", but I enjoyed this one more. The movie is set to come out next month as well!

*The Great Alone, Kristin Hannah* -- This book takes place in the late 70s and is about an abusive Vietnam vet and his family and their quest to ""start fresh"" in Alaska. This is a relatively new book, having been published last year but out of all of the novels I've read, this was one of my favorites. Good character depth and a long timeline of events that dont feel rushed or glossed over. 

*The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles, Haruki Murakami* -- This is by far my favorite Murakami book. There's a part in the book where a general is telling a war-time story, those that have already read the book know what I'm talking about. Its one of the best parts of the book and a story within a story that has stuck with me since reading it. If you haven't read Murakami yet, this is a good place to start. 

**Non-Fiction**:

*Missoula, Jon Krakauer* -- You probably know Krakauer from Into Thin Air (worth the hype), but in this book he tackles rape, rape allegations and the legal process of rape within Universities, specifically Missoula. This book was very eye opening to me because it delves deeper into victims and their experiences. Before this book, all I knew was what was said on television about rape trials, basically he said she said, and the trials' verdicts. Reading this made me much more sympathetic to victims/accusers. Given the current #MeToo movement and the empowerment of victims to come forward, I think if there's one book you take away from this post, it's this one. 

*Tribe, Sebastian Junger* -- This author is the mastermind behind the famous documentary ""Restrepo"" that followed Army soldiers in the dangerous Afghan Korengal valley. In this book he focuses a lot more on returning soldiers, PTSD and how to better understand combat and non-combat veterans. This is a very short read (45mins - 1hr) but you come away with such a better understanding of veterans and their difficulty of readjusting to civilian life.

*Fall and Rise: The Story of 9/11, Mitchell Zuckoff* -- This book on 9/11 focuses less on the actual terrorist actions, and what led to those actions, and more on actual people impacted by 9/11. I have to warn you though, this book is extremely heart-breaking. You learn a lot about victims and their final days, their final actions and final moments of life. It's a gut-wrenching read that gives you a whole new intimate understanding of the suffering that went on that day and the days, weeks and years that followed. I've never cried while reading a book but this book was as close as I ever got to doing so. 

*No Place To Hide, Glenn Greenwald* -- Greenwald is the journalist who broke the Snowden/NSA mass surveillance story in 2013. This book covers the events of before, during and after his Snowden meeting in Hong Kong. He also goes into depth of some of the NSA spying tools, how they work and who they target. Its a very digestable book and you dont need to be a computer whiz to understand the programs he lays out. Greenwald is one of my favorite journalists and this book further cemented that for me. 

*The Anatomy of Terror, Ali Soufan* -- Soufan is a former counter-terrorism FBI agent who in this book details exactly how radical Islamists think, operate and specifically on the rise of the islamic state in the Middle East after the US invaded Iraq. He also goes deep into the sectarian wars between terror groups themselves (Sunnis vs Shias etc). This book gave me a better understanding of how from nothing in 2009, IS rose to power.

**Science**:

*A Crack In Creation, Jennifer Doudna* -- If you've heard of the gene editing method ""CRISPR"" and the many many medical benefits it can have for humanity, it is because of Jennifer Doudna, the scientist who in 2013 discovered that CRISPR Cas-9 has the ability to edit DNA. This book was really fascinating and very easy to read. You dont need to have an interest in biology or genetic engineering to enjoy the book. This book led me down the DNA subject rabbit hole and I wound up reading books on Paleontology, ancient human DNA from Neanderthals and Denisovans, to evolution and ancient life. If you want to learn more about the benefits of gene editing, this is the book to read. 

*The Hidden Reality, Brian Greene* -- Greene is a world-renowned physicist most notably known for String Theory. This book is a layman's introduction into String Theory and the multi-universe theory. Again, you dont need to have an interest in physics to enjoy the book. I have never even taken a physics class before reading this book and deeply enjoyed it. If you like watching youtube videos by PBS Space Time, you'll enjoy this book. Greene does a good job in laying out all the information in a way anyone can understand it. 

*Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari* -- If you've read Sapiens by this author where he focuses on who we are and how we got here and enjoyed it, then you'll enoy this book that focuses on who we're becoming and where we're going. A bunch of broad subjects are discussed in this book and you'll walk away having digested a bunch of information. He's a historian so we wont dive too deeply into a subject but you'll instead get a broad picture of it. 

**History**:

*The Road To Jonestown, Jeff Guinn* -- Before I read this book, I always thought of the Jonestown event as a mass suicide by a bunch of religious cultists following a crazy ass religious/socialist zealot. I remember watching YouTube videos on the event as well and forming my opinion on it from them. But there's just so much more to it. It gives you perspectives from former members, how they were either brainwashed or coerced to remain in the 'Peoples Temple'. How the vast majority of the residents of Jonestown were actually lied to and fooled to going to Guyana to how those that did not commit suicide were either shot or forcibly injected cyanide. A very powerful book with insight on how cults operate.

*The Billion Dollar Spy, David E. Hoffman* -- This book follows Adolf Tolkachev, a soviet engineer turned CIA spy during the cold war. For years he fed military secrets to his handler, secrets that saved the US over a billion dollars earning him his nickname and the title of this book. I had never heard of this man until reading this book but I'm glad I did. The man had massive balls and risked everything to do anything he could to topple the soviet union. 

*House To House, SSG. David Bellavia* -- Of all the war related books I've read, this is the most gripping and exhilarating one yet. Its a memoir written by Staff Sergeant David Bellavia that takes place during the height of the Iraqi insurgency in Fallujah. If you read this book, you immediately think ""bullshit, this doesnt even happen in movies, this is obviously fake"" because of how crazy the events in the book are. But they're not only 100% true, but were all captured on film thanks to journalist Michael Ware. It was just a few weeks ago too that the author was awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military honor in the US, for the actions he took which he laid out in this memoir of his. Great read. 

*Man's Search For Meaning, Viktor Frankl* -- Frankl is a psychiatrist who was sent to a concentration camp by the nazis during WW2. He observed and noted the behavior of his fellow prisoners and saw how despite the horrid conditions they lived in, they continued to find meaning in their lives. This book is very powerful and it is also a short read given the book is 2 parts. You can make do with only reading the first part, the second part he does a deeper dive into psychology and logo-therapy. Many people on this sub have recommended this book and its with good merit. This is a powerful book. 


**Books that live up to the hype**:

*Harry Potter Series, JK Rowling* -- Dont ask me why I like these books. Im a 24 year old dude who could not turn away for one second after picking up these books. I owe an apology to all those kids I mentally judged as a kid because they were really into HP. I thought the allure of these books would be lost on me because of my age but that wasnt the case. If you havent read them yet, you should at least give them a chance. 

*A Song Of Ice And Fire, George RR Martin* -- I am very glad that I decided to read these books before starting to watch the HBO series. I loved these books and although it was challenging, for me at least, to get into Martin's writing style where he goes back and forth between characters, it became easier as I read on and started to catch on to the plot and I grew to like the style. I've expressed to my family how much I like this series so I'm looking forward to getting Winds of Winter for my 40th birthday. 

*Anything by Kurt Vonnegut* -- I've read about half a dozen of Vonnegut's books and havent been let down by any of them. They're a treasure trove of quotes and analogies. There are those who are contrarians and say he's overrated because of how much hype he gets but dont be turned away by them. He's a good author who deserves 100% of the admiration he gets.

*The Kite Runner & A Thousand Splendid Suns, Khaled Hosseini* -- I read both of these books my senior year in high school and decided to re-read them because I thoroughly enjoyed them back then. They were just as good as I remembered them. Hosseini gets recommended a lot on this sub for tear-jerking books and rightfully so. His books take place or have root in Afghanistan given hes an Afghan native himself and he gives good insight on what it is like coming up as an Afghan youth. Great author.

*Dark Matter, Blake Crouch* -- You probably already read this book for the off chance you havent, you should. Its recommended here religiously for good reason. You get sucked in from page one and the story is very easy to follow. His new book ""Recursion"" is also worth a look if you read Dark Matter and enjoyed it.

**Overall favorite book**:

*East of Eden, John Steinbeck* -- Out of the 250 books I read, I have not enjoyed one more than I have East of Eden. This was a very easy choice to make, about one third into the book I knew I was reading something special. The characters, Steinbeck's way of writing, the story-line, everything. There's a very good chance that no book will ever dethrone this one as my favorite and that makes me a little sad. Nonetheless, I am very glad that I read it. Its a beautiful book that I look forward to re-reading. 


I should clarify that the above list is just my very humble opinion. I have a certain taste in writing and information that the previous authors knew how to struck. I've included a screenshot to all 250 books I've read at the top of this post, [and here as well](https://imgur.com/a/sOwySVE). Feel free to ask me about any single one of them, I remember them perfectly and will to respond to everyone :)",normal

"Anybody else used to read a ton before smartphones became a thing? I'm so tired of this fucking cursed rectangle. I reward myself for a hard day of work by coming home and browsing the little rectangle while the big rectangle plays in the background, and perhaps using the medium rectangle to inject dopamine points into my eyeballs with video games for an hour or so.

My parents were for whatever reason a little slow to allow me my first smartphone (I had a flip phone until about 2012). I was a quiet, well behaved, and very obviously outwardly depressed student, so most of my teachers would let me either sleep (during periods 1, 2, and either 4 or 5 depending on which one was immediately after lunch) or read in the back of class (during periods 3, 4, and 6) because I was doing well on all my tests anyway. 

(I also just want to take a second to say fuck high school schedules. I was and am a natural 3-11 sleeper like a lot of high schoolers were, and having to get up at 6:30 to go to learning jail should be against the Geneva Convention)

Reading used to be my escape, man! I remember when Inheritance came out and I was so stoked for it and I finished it in like 3 days. It was so immersive and I would often maladaptively daydream that I was in the book doing something awesome.

"I read The Hobbit to my 6 year old son over the course of two months. It was one of the best experiences of my life. I've been waiting to read The Hobbit to my son since he was born but I had to wait until he was old enough to appreciate it. It was my first time reading it, also. He loves all things to do with knights, castles, and dragons so I knew it would be a big hit.

Over the course of two months, for roughly 30 minutes a night before bedtime, I acted out, as best as possible, the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and Company. I immensely enjoyed voice acting the various characters and could slip into Hobbit, Dwarf, Elf, Smaug, and, most enjoyably, Gollum at a whim. 

We finished last night and today I overheard my son singing the Misty Mountain song (I got several requests to repeat that part and I was able to sing it well thanks to YouTube). That experience brought us closer together and it warms my heart to know how much he appreciated our Hobbit time each night.

"Ender's Game seems like the poster child for 'support the art not the artist'. I don't understand how an outspoken homophobe wrote this amazing book that champions the power of empathy, but thank goodness for libraries and used book stores so we can still read and enjoy this wonderful book. Orson Scott Card is an outspoken homophobe who donates to anti-gay causes, so its a pretty natural response to not want to support him financially. Here are a couple quotes from him on the issue:

>""Regardless of law, marriage has only one definition, and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy. I will act to destroy that government and bring it down.""  
>  
>""The dark secret of homosexual society ‚Äî the one that dares not speak its name ‚Äî is how many homosexuals first entered into that world through a disturbing seduction or rape or molestation or abuse, and how many of them yearn to get out of the homosexual community and live¬†normally.""

So, gross is a bit of an understatement. That said, Ender's Game has an incredibly important message that it would truly be a shame to lose. Thank goodness we're fans of a medium which has options for consuming the art without financially supporting the artist.

If you haven't read the book, here's the setup (no spoilers IMO, back of the book kind of thing, but I'll still put it in black in case you prefer to go in with a blank slate). >!It's the story of Ender Wiggin, a boy who is recruited into the elite orbital Battle School. There, young men and women are trained into the next generation of military leaders to command the forces of humanity against the buggers. The buggers are insect-like aliens who have attempted to invade the solar system twice, nearly wiping out humanity in the most recent invasion, and now humanity is preparing for the next battle.!<

>!Ender is a brilliant, empathetic kid, but has felt mostly alone his entire life. His older brother Peter is a violent sociopath, and only Ender‚Äôs older sister Valentine prevented Peter from attacking Ender. Now, at battle school, Ender feels even more alone, surrounded by children older than himself and adults who are constantly pushing him to his limits and trying to force him to be violent in an attempt to either break him or mold him into the best military commander Earth has ever produced.!<

This book is so many wonderful things at once.

First, the core theme of the book is the power of empathy and how, even if you're only goal is to 'succeed' in life, you still should strive to put yourself in other people's shoes. Sure, you need intelligence and drive, but if you truly understand other people and how they think and feel, you'll both be the kind of person other people want to be around and able to understand other people's motivations and values. I don't know about in the rest of the world, but in America we have far too little popular art that highlights the power and importance of empathy - and by showing how empathy is invaluable even to people who only want to 'succeed', I think Card has made a truly unique argument for a habitually undervalued virtue that speaks perfectly to the people who most need to hear it.

The book is also just an unbelievable page turner. It's the classic hero's journey - and Ender is a hero that you absolutely will want to root for. How can you not be on the side of the brilliant, sensitive six year old kid who is taken from his family and put through hell to try and save the whole human race? It's also got one of the best twists of all time, which in addition to blowing your mind on the first read, also brings home subthemes about the importance of communication to avoid conflict, and a general anti-war message as well.

For lots of other kinds of art, its very hard to consume that art without financially supporting the artist. Thank goodness that we have libraries and used book stores, which make it possible to read wonderful books by problematic authors without sending money to that problematic author.

"In December readers donated over $700,000 to Patrick Rothfuss' charity for him to read a chapter from Doors of Stone with the expectation of ""February at the latest."" He has made no formal update in 8 months. Just another update that the chapter has yet to be released and Patrick Rothfuss has not posted a blog mentioning it since December. This is just to bring awareness to the situation, please please be respectful when commenting.

For those interested in the full background:

* Each year Rothfuss does a fundraiser through his charity
* Last year he initially set the stretch goal to read the Prologue
* This goal was demolished and he added a second stretch goal to read another chapter
* This second goal was again demolished and he attempted to backtrack on the promise demanding there be a third stretch goal that was essentially ""all or nothing"" (specifically saying, ""I never said when I would release the chapter"")
* After significant backlash his community manager spoke to him and he apologized and clarified the chapter would be released regardless
* He then added a third stretch goal to have a 'super star' team of voice actors narrate the chapter he was planning to release
* This goal was also met and the final amount raised was roughly $1.25 million
* He proceeded to read the prologue shortly after the end of the fundraiser
* He stated in December we would receive the new chapter by ""February at the latest""
* There has been zero official communication on the chapter since then

Some additional clarifications:

* While Patrick Rothfuss does own the charity the money is not held by them and goes directly to (I believe) Heifer International. This is not to say that Rothfuss does not directly benefit from the fundraiser being a success (namely through the fact that he pays himself nearly $100,000 for renting out ~~his home~~ a building he purchased as the charity's HQ aside from any publicity, sponsorships, etc. that he receives). But Rothfuss is by no means pocketing $1.3M and running.
* I believe that Rothfuss has made a few comments through other channels (eg: during his Twitch streams) ""confirming"" that the chapter is delayed but I honestly have only seen those in articles/reddit posts found by googling for updates on my own
* Regarding the prologue, all three books are extremely similar so he read roughly roughly 1-2 paragraphs of new text
* Rothfuss has used Book 3 as an incentive for several years at this point, one example of a previous incentive goal was to stream him writing a chapter (it was essentially a stream of him just typing on his computer, we could not see the screen/did not get any information)

Edit: Late here but for posterity one clarification is that the building rented as Worldbuilder's HQ is not Rothfuss' personal home but instead a separate building that he (""Elodin Holdings LLC"") purchased. The actual figure is about $80,000.

"If a fictional universe has dragons and magic in it, there's no real reason it can't also have black people or Asian people in it. I think the idea of fantasy worlds are so cool. I love seeing dragons and magic and struggles between good and evil. It's all amazing to me. But when some people get their panties in a twist about forced diversity because one background character is darker than others it just makes me think that you're too indoctrinated by this political climate we live in to enjoy the actual story. There's a fucking dragon getting slayed but you are pissed there's an Asian wizard in the background in the climatic fight scene? That doesn't sound like an actual grevience. Sounds like a personal problem.

I'll take it a step further. I don't care if main characters are diverse. If it's a fictional world not based on any real people I say go nuts. People say it's pandering but litterally it's all pandering. White dudes get pandered too so much they don't even notice it like a fish in water. Let me have a bad ass Asian dude on a quest to unite the four kingdoms with a bad ass party full of knights and wizards. I don't care as long as the story is good but someone being a different skin color in a fantasy setting that's not based on actual things that happened doesn't and shouldn't bother anyone.

Edit: Quick notes because I got pretty overwhelmed with the response.

* when I say Asian I mean people of Asian decent in the story. Not litterally from Asia in a fictional universe. Like you'd describe Asian coded people in your world like how the shu are described in 6 of crows. Not put Asian products africa in your fantasy world.

* I don't mean only Asian or black people. It's every miniority underrepresented people in fantasy. Gay, Indian, trans, Hispanic etc etc.

* saying ""but what if they changed black Panther white isn't a gotcha. It's a really clich√© disengenous argument..

* Diversity doesn't ever need justification. Ever. I shouldn't ever have to justify my existence. Especially when you never try to justify the existence of white people.

* representation is important. Just because you don't personally see the value of it doesn't mean it isn't valuable.

* yes I have read more than one fantasy book. The fact that people would attack me and gatekeep because I haven't read your favorite series is messed up. I'm just as real of a fan as you.

* me making this post isn't forcing diversity down your throat.

* saying I don't want diversity I just want good stories is just telling on yourself. Firstly, wanting both is perfectly okay. Secondly, they aren't mutually exclusive.

* no, ""just imagining the characters as whatever you want"" isn't an answer. If the character is clearly described as a white dude, and is casted as a white dude in the movies, me imagining he looks like me does nothing to fix the issues we're talking about.

* asking why people still care about skin color ignores how many people can't choose to ignore their skin color. In America people are still treated differently and have very different lived experiences because of their skin color. Stop saying that like it's a obvious answer it's not and it's off topic.

* no wanting more diversity isn't racist.

* I truly don't care about karma. It can't buy me anything. I never understood reddits obsession with karma. I didn't realize there's an unwritten rule about not crossposting after a certain date. So if that bothered you I'm sorry. I updated the post with the bulleted thoughts because the intention wasn't to do that. 

Look man all I wanted to do here was vent about how I wanted to see more diverse fantasy but yall one one. No one should be called racist because they care about representation.",normal

"Modern libraries are awesome and deserve a shoutout! Last year, I moved to a new city and my first instinct was to pick up a library card from my nearest public library. It's amazing how they have changed with the times! 

My library has three media rooms, a 3D printer (plus classes to take on how to use it), a video production library full of equipment you can check out, a teen game room, yoga classes, small business classes and more. I was really amazed at how much of a central community hub it had become compared to my old public library which was still a bit older and dated. 

You can even check out a kindle while you go on vacation! You can preload books to read and take it with you. Simply return once you get home. Now I live on the road and constantly travel. I use their online catalog to rent ebooks onto my kindle. I literally have a library with me wherever I go! 

I can't overstate how much I love my library! 

Edit: I also wanted to add for those who don't have a kindle, you can download the kindle app to your phone or computer for free! That's what I did before I was gifted my current kindle :)

Double edit: Since some people are curious, my main library is Library21c in Colorado Springs, CO.

Last Edit I promise: User r/Fartin_Van_Buren pointed out to me that the Colorado Library System is set up to receive donations from smile.amazon.com. Just search under ""Pikes Peak Library District"". ",normal

"For people interested in a sequel to the Harry Potter series who were disappointed by Cursed Child, try the James Potter fan fiction series by G. Norman Lippert. Four full length books are already out with JK Rowling's permission, all completely free! The series itself features a fascinating new plot line related to but not dependent on Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. The protagonist is Harry's son, James Potter, starting at his first year at Hogwarts. The characters are a good mix of characters you know and their descendants, and totally new characters. The conflicts are much more multidimensional, with a lot more moral ambiguity and complexity, without straying from the plucky adventurous tone HP fans will love. The books also delve more fully into the theory and origin of magic, the international wizarding community, the history of magic, and the founding of Hogwarts. The writing style is evocative of JK Rowling without attempting to copy it, with a good mix of humorousness, classes, and childhood antics to complement the main conflicts.

It's available as an audiobook/podcast by chapter for free, and there are free PDFs of all the books easy to find on Google. Hope you enjoy these books as much as I have!

EDIT: As some people have pointed out, turns out there are actually FIVE books! Even better!
EDIT: To be clear, JK Rowling gave the author permission to distribute the books for free, but did NOT endorse the series as canon.",normal

"Has Stephen King always put weirdly sexual things into his books or did I just stumble onto two that happened to have it? *SPOILER* I read Billy Summers a couple months ago and really liked the parental, father/daughter vibe I THOUGHT I was getting from the relationship of the two main characters, until the young woman (19/20) ends up falling in love with the 45 year old (!!!) man. 

And now I am halfway through Firestarter which I believe is a new release and once again there is a grown man, developing a weird romantic relationship with an 8 year old! 

Such a shame because I really enjoyed both books up until he introduced this point. In both books it literally adds nothing to the plot, the storyline would have been literally unchanged if he kept it non-romantic/sexual. I was planning on reading more of his books but after these two I am probably going to give up.

Edit: did not expect this to blow up! From the sounds of it this is a recurring theme throughout his books so I will be taking him off my future reads. 

Also my mistake, someone pointed out that Firestarter is not new; the copy that I bought had a newer cover and I had never heard of it before so I assumed it was a new release.

Edit2: some of you are really upset over the fact that I don‚Äôt enjoy reading about childrens sexual activity/descriptions of peoples genitals/whatever other weird stuff King includes‚Ä¶.are you guys ok??

"4 years ago my dad passed away, today I finally receive the first copy of the book he wrote and never dared to publish First of all, my dad was in love with books, really.. Reading was his life. I didn't know that writing was a part of it too...

4 years ago, I was 22, he passed away. Few months after that my mom gave me a 150 pages of text and told me it was written by my dad and one of his guilty dream was to some day be published. 

It took me few weeks, maybe months, to finally read it, some handwritten notes from my mom was also in the text, it was like I was having a last discussion with my dad. I decided to do everything I could to publish it even at a really small scale. 

At the beginning of this year my mom passed away too (she never really recovered from the loss of my father), I‚Äôm sad that I never had the chance to offer her one copy of the book, but today is a big achievement in my life and I wanted to tell my story here and share it with you, because a lot of my motivation and energy came from all the reddit community, so thank you everyone here for being such an awesome community.

EDIT: WOW! You guys are all amazing! Thank you so much for the support! Thank you for your kind words! Thank you for the platinum, gold and silver!! 

A lot of you asked where you can buy it, for the moment.. nowhere I made some copies by myself! Next step is to find a way to publish it and propose it in store :)

I‚Äôm french so the book is in French so if anyone here speak/read French, I will be honored to find a way to send you a copy when I‚Äôll have more available! 

Many of you asked for the synopsis, it‚Äôs a novel, the story of a boy who lost his father in an accident, and few years later her mom died because of sadness of her loss (yes. It looks like my own life I swear to god that it‚Äôs incredibly weird but 100% true) and the book is about the life of this boy and how he will fall in love with books, books will save and maybe destroy him at the same time. 

I‚Äôll try to answer to everyone, thank you so much again for your kindness and support!

EDIT 2: I saw some people talking about sales strategy... I swear it‚Äôs 100% true. 
And I want to say something: everyone here who wants a copy will have one for free (maybe digital one because I don‚Äôt have a lot of copies..) I don‚Äôt want to earn money from this, your support and kindness already help me so much, you can‚Äôt even imagine",normal

"World War Z is a surprisingly good book. I thought previously ""Yet Another Zombie Book"" But this one actually deserved a movie to go along with it! What can I say. Its actually GOOD!

&#x200B;

(Personal Bias) Its in the format I like.  I prefer blog post summaries to extended scientific debates.  I enjoy short stories over novels.    Its easier to make a small decent quality meal vs a four course entree which ends up boring you. I can put this down and go to something else rather easily. This book is not a 4 hour course at a specialty cruise.  It's a row of specialty snacks...loosely arranged in the order it wants you to partake in them. You have quite a bit of personal choice in how you want to read this.

&#x200B;

The short stories are engaging and have a nice personal touch to them.    The wide variety of individuals with different jobs, backgrounds, and personalities have actually reminded me of the book ""Working"" by Studs Terkel.

&#x200B;

The best stories are, of course, about the people not involved with the military(At least, during the initial spreading outbreak).  Zombie stories are best done like survivalist stories. That way you can make the behavior of the people actually believable and gripping!  Quite a few of the military stories involve absolutely idiotic behavior and planning.  Mindless zombies with no strategy have no real hope of taking on an organized military...so the only way to make them win is to give the commanders severe mental deficits.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Once you forget about the above...the stories are well written!    Humans turn into cannibals.  Humans bring their gamecubes they cannot play to remind them of home life perks.   People get saved.  I ""liked"" the story of the Martin Shkreli pharma guy who made the fake zombie vaccine and raked in millions.  People gradually turn into metaphorical monsters in order to fend off material monsters. A trope, but one which at least makes sense. Oh, and the ""individual outpost"" military stories are actually also well done.

&#x200B;

Oh, and it has its cheery moments too! People reminding others to stay alive and upbeat.  People going back risking themselves to save others.  After the ""victory"" life seems to go back to normal...albeit a vastly reduced population and quite different architectural standards to ward off zombies. I would love to see a drawup of the new ""anti-zombie"" architecture ubiquitous in every city.

&#x200B;

One of the few 5/5 fictional books I have read in quite awhile! If you didn't know in advance that the Zombie genre simply has never done the ""military vs initial outbreak"" successfully you may rank it lower.  Instead, you simply have to take that as a given. Engage your suspension of disbelief for some key common and necessary tropes and this \*actually\* ends up fairly realistic.

&#x200B;

Here is a nice quote.

&#x200B;

""In the beginning everyone was friendly. We cooperated. We traded or even bought what we needed from other families. Money was still worth something. Everyone thought the banks would be reopening soon. Whenever Mom and Dad would go looking for food, they‚Äôd always leave me with a neighbor. I had this little survival radio, the kind you cranked for power, so we could listen to the news every night. It was all stories of the pullout, army units leaving people stranded. We‚Äôd listen with our road map of the United States, pointing to the cities and towns where the reports were coming from. I‚Äôd sit on Dad‚Äôs lap. ‚ÄúSee,‚Äù he‚Äôd say, ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt get out in time. They weren‚Äôt smart like us.‚Äù He‚Äôd try to force a smile. For a little while, I thought he was right. But after the first month, when the food started running out, and the days got colder and darker, people started getting mean. There were no more communal fires, no more cookouts or singing. The camp became a mess, nobody picking up their trash anymore. A couple times I stepped in human shit. Nobody was even bothering to bury it.""",normal

"I saved about $800 a year because of the library if I count only the books I finished reading, and I save about $2,400 a year if I count every book I read from the library. The library is one of the greatest gifts to humanity. In a year, I finished reading about 52 books. Of these, about 12 were from my personal purchases (physical books and audiobooks), while about 40 came from the library.  So let that sink in, a normal book costs $10 to $15, but I'll assume each book costs $20 because I also borrow textbooks, which are more expensive than ordinary books. So, 40 books at $20 each equals $800. This means I save about $800 a year because of the library. But if I calculate the total number of books I borrowed from the library, both finished and unfinished, I checked my loan history and found that I borrowed about 120 books. That would cost $2,400. So, the library helps me save a lot of money. Now, Youtube, podcasts, audiobooks, ps5, ps4 ,Nintendo Switch consume much of my time. However, if I want to learn in-depth topics or great stories, books are still number one in my heart, and the library is one of the greatest inventions.

"Ender's Game is one of the best books I've ever read - Don't judge a book by its shitty back-cover summary I finished Ender's Game last week, and what a brilliant book it is. It was sitting on my shelf for 2 years because I ordered it online and lost all interest in reading it after reading the back cover summary ""a 6-year-old trying to save the world from bugs"" made me think it's a book for 6yo.

But I am so glad that I did. The story was great and the story-telling was superb, it kept my interesting trough the whole story, and made Ender feel relatable and real. Which is so rare in this genre that is dominated by 1 dimensional ""boring hero"" characters.

The story of his growth and becoming more mature with each chapter, but still facing the same problems. Toward the end I was sure that there is a second book, because I thought there is no way they wrap it up in 50 pages, so it gave me a mind blown moment.

The sun goes down upon the Ankh,  
And slowly, softly fades -  
Across the Drum; the Royal Bank;  
The River-Gate; the Shades.

A stony circle's closed to elves;  
And here, where lines are blurred,  
Between the stacks of books on shelves,  
A quiet '*Ook*' is heard.

A copper steps the city-street  
On paths he's often passed;  
The final march; the final beat;  
The time to rest at last.

He gives his badge a final shine,  
And sadly shakes his head -  
While Granny lies beneath a sign  
That says: 'I aten't dead.'

The Luggage shifts in sleep and dreams;  
It's now. The time's at hand.  
For where it's always night, it seems,  
A timer clears of sand.

And so it is that Death arrives,  
When all the time has gone...  
But dreams endure, and hope survives,  
And Discworld carries on.

"I'm a 23 year old, straight man who has recently fallen in love with contemporary romance novels and I think that it is important for other men to try them as well. Here's why. I didn't know quite where else to discuss this, but I needed to get off this my chest and felt this would be a supportive community. In recent months, I have felt increasingly down and depressed due to being closeted indoors, as many of us did due to COVID-19. Days melded together and genuine human connection had become next to impossible as everything went virtual. For an introvert, like myself, I was able to cope with isolation better than most, but I still craved something deep and emotional that I could not easily achieve. This led me down the path to try my first romance novel, specifically a book called ***The Kiss Quotient***, and I fell in love nearly instantly.

Like many men, I have been taught by society that we should generally suppress significant displays of emotion and let actions speak louder than words. This can be seen in nearly every form of media/entertainment focused on male audiences from books, movies, and TV all the way to advertisements.  I would always find myself overwhelmed by the overly masculine protagonists that kicked ass and who's entire character development never centered around their growth with another individual in a romantic nature. Romantic partners were often seen as a plus to have, but never a key component to the growth of the protagonist. For this reason, when a romance took place and offered itself as a core part of the characters growth, it felt refreshing and always made me feel much better as a result (there are so few examples that I can't even think of one off the top of my head even now). Eventually, I realized that there was, in fact, a genre that offered this satisfaction, but not as a side note, as the main purpose of the story: romance.

Similar to the stigma that men should hide their emotions, I always felt that there was this unsaid truth that romance novels just weren't for men and those who read them often did so privately out of the desire to not be ridiculed or look unmasculine. Similarly, romance novels, at least these days, are thought to simply be erotica which older women can read in public (looking at you ***50 Shades***). These misconceptions has prevented me from trying them for many years as a result, something that I now feel was a missed opportunity for many more years of pleasure reading.

The book that changed this, as mentioned above, was ***The Kiss Quotient*** by Helen Hoang. This is a story of an autistic woman who hires a male escort to teach her how to be a more romantic person and be more skilled at sex. Naturally, as the story progresses, they learn more about each other and fall in love, despite their difference in social class, wealth, and family trauma. What I loved about the story was not the world, which often led me to other genre's like fantasy, but the characters. While many books focused on male audiences often offer huge casts of characters which have minimal change over the story, this book and many of it's peers had a small cast which gave the writer a chance to highlight their growth on a personal level in greater depth in less time than in huge series such as ***Harry Potter***, where Harry has very little growth in 7 large books (don't get be wrong, I love the series, but I'd hazard a guess that like many others it was due to the interesting world and huge cast of colorful, albeit flat, characters).

I have since devoured several other contemporary romance novels, each time enjoying the emotional character depth present for the two leads. However, the ever present stigmas have prevented me, until now, from really discussing the novels with other people, which as many of you know is half the fun of reading anything. This isolation has made me feel the need to write this post. I feel that there are many others out there that, similar to me, really want something that can provide some emotional based story telling and I believe that romance novels can provide just this.

Now don't get me wrong, these novels do suffer from similar problems in representation regarding men that other genres have towards women. For example, while many TV shows, movies, and books show women as physical goddess that can have the emotional complexity of a hunk of wood, romance novels often depict men as physical machines that have muscles so hard  you could shatter concrete against them while also being gods at sex. This can be very disheartening for male readers, as they can have an inferiority complex and can give the impression that this demigod form is needed to find the emotional happiness depicted in the stories. However, I believe that this provides men a chance to understand and sympathize with the way many women feel about how they are represented in nearly everything else! The solution to improve this stigma in romance novels is the same one needed to fix how women are depicted: more male writers. This in turn can only be done if romance gains a higher male readership who would demand more accurate representation.

In conclusion, I feel that more male readers should give romantic novels a try. It's my firm belief that similar to me, many would actually find a new medium that can proved emotional satisfaction that is so often left out in other genres despite the fact that romance is something nearly everyone will experience at some point in their life. Further more, it has opened my eyes wider to the pressure that women feel in from other media to accept the idea that your physique is core to your happiness, and understand how degrading it can be.

Thank you to everyone that read this entire ramble. I have been needing to get this off my chest for some time and I hope that this gave you some food for thought.

**EDIT:** I really want to thank everyone for all their support and recommendations! It really has meant a lot to see. I have been trying to comment on as many things as I've had time to and I will continue to do so, but please excuse me if I don't get the chance to read what you have to say :(. Also thank your for my first ever gold reward!

**EDIT 2:** At the request of some, I've written a *TLDR*

**TLDR**; Men should try romance novels in spite of social stigma's against displaying emotion as they offer highly satisfying character growth, but also provide a means to experience the inferiority women feel in other genres which can yield much needed shift towards true character representation in all forms of media.

**EDIT 3:** I really want to thank everyone again for their support and suggestions! I just wanted to comment on something that many people have been recommending to me, which is to try watching romance anime and manga. I love romance anime and manga! One reason that I discovered my love of romance in general started when I watch the anime movie **Your Name**. However, as I pointed out to one user, the thing that pushed me towards American romance novels was a significant lack of physical intimacy that is present in Japanese story telling. This is a result of the differences in culture and simply comes with the territory, but as a result, few stories have intimacy present prior to the final chapters or episodes. Also since it was a key topic in my essay, I should also mention that many Japanese anime and manga don't really help with the issues of normal physique in regards to women and can often have some very sexist caricatures of women that I honestly have been getting tired of. That being said, I do appreciate the recommendations and am loving the discussions that are taking place in the comments section!",normal

"Life's too short to read books you're not enjoying Last night, I started a new book. I'm guessing I bought it at the library book sale based on the cover and the blurb on the back. I hadn't read anything from this author. From the moment I started the book, it was awful, like a high schooler's first attempt at a novel.

I kept reading until I reached this paragraph: ""Maybe he hadn't gone too far. Maybe he wasn't in deep doodoo. Who knows, he might even get to screw her"" on page 8. I closed the book and can't wait to re-donate it back to the library - at least they'll make another dollar if it sells again.

Anyway, the point is I always see posts about people who want to know how far in a book they should read before giving up. My advice: when you're not enjoying it. That's when you stop. Life is just too damn short to read a book that you're not enjoying (unless, of course, it's for a school assignment).

"Harry Potter is a solid children's series - but I find it mildly frustrating that so many adults of my generation never seem to 'graduate' beyond it & other YA series to challenge themselves. Anyone agree or disagree? Hope that doesn't sound too snobby - they're fun to reread and not badly written at all - great, well-plotted comfort food with some superb imaginative ideas and wholesome/timeless themes. I just find it weird that so many adults seem to think they're the apex of novels and don't try anything a bit more 'literary' or mature...

Tell me why I'm wrong!

Edit: well, we're having a discussion at least :)

Last edit, honest guvnah: I should clarify in the OP - I actually really love Harry Potter and I singled it out bc it's the most common. Not saying that anyone who reads them as an adult is trash, more that I hope people push themselves onwards as well. Sorry for scapegoating, JK

"Have you ever stopped listening to an audiobook because the tone of the narrator was so annoying. I did that last week with *[The Life Changing Art of Tidying Up](https://archive.org/details/Marie.Kondo..The.LifeChanging.Magic.of.Tidying.Up..audiobook..004)*

It's a book related to discarding excess of material things from life and thus living a life that is more clear and fulfilling, which in my opinion is Minimalism. I recently took up Minimalism and so I wanted to check this book out. I heard a lot about this book in the last few months.

But by the time I was half way through it, it got so annoying that I just couldn't take it anymore.

There are actually two reasons why I quit this book:

1. The book starts by author telling (rather insisting) that hers is the *only way* to follow minimalism. (I tend to have trouble with anything that says their way is the only way to do something.)

2. The tone of the narrator was so annoying, she always had that overreaching self-centered pride in almost every single sentence.

Combine these both and it was a real irritating experience to listen to this book. So, I told myself: *fuck it,* and scrapped the folder from my phone.

Did any of you ever had this sort of experience with an audiobook before?

This is probably a reason why I've usually preferred more visual mediums like video games, tv shows and movies. 

For me, reading books tends to be a continuation of one of those mediums, rather than the launching point of interest. For instance, I'm currently reading the Witcher series after playing the games and seeing the Netflix show.


So for those with the ability to visualize, does it just happen as you quickly as you read? Or does it happen more after the fact as you recall characters and events?

your affectionate Godfather,

C.S. Lewis""

The stages of liking, outgrowing, and returning to fairy tales is a comment that resonated with how I've been reading of late. I have been revisiting the books that I read back in school, those that I grew up with. I realise that perhaps I could not have enjoyed these even a few years earlier, and yet, having reached a certain age (how wonderfully Lewis leaves that open-ended), I'm realising that despite what is often said, these are, in fact, stories that I can return to, no matter how much my age may supposedly separate me from the maturity that these books express. Of course, part of returning is a way of feeding nostalgia, but I have also been feeling that these books still have things to give. They have not been exhausted.",normal
"I just want to thank you guys for getting me into reading. I'm 15 and I hated reading so much. 

It seemed so boring to me and I was constantly getting distracted. I'd read a whole page but wouldn't understand anything I've read, and thought I hated reading. It turns out that I never hated it, I just wasn't reading the right books. 

Some time last week, I saw a post on the front page from this subreddit talking about the book, ""When Breath Becomes Air"", and how it was the first story that made someone cry in 15 years. I didn't believe you could actually be touched by books; the stories I was forced to read in school never made me feel that way and I assumed all books were the same.

Before I even clicked on the post, I checked it out at the library to see what it was all about, and I finished it in two days. I was bawling my eyes out by the end of the book and since then I've been hooked.

I found out I loved reading on my own, at my own pace, peacefully in my room. Sitting in an overcrowded classroom full of kids who didn't want to be there, reading 20 pages a day, and having to stop in the middle of a chapter just to answer questions about the character is the reason why kids think they hate reading. And it doesn't help at all that teachers pick the slowest readers to read the longest paragraphs in the book. 

I looked up must-read books on Google and this subreddit came up, giving me a whole list of books that people recommended. I went to the library on Sunday and picked up 4 more books that were on the list. Today I finished reading The Alchemist, and tomorrow I will read Brave New World. 

I never thought I'd ever enjoy reading on my own time, but now I can see why people love books so much. Thank you guys for recommending and discussing great books, and for reading my post! Have a great day! ",normal

- [East of Eden by John Steinbeck](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4406.East_of_Eden): I've heard so many good things about it, but it seems so biblical to me... Maybe I should read it with an open mind?

- [Pillars of The Earth by Ken Follet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5043.The_Pillars_of_the_Earth): Like East of Eden, I don't know if this book is for me, but who knows?

- [Dune by Frank Herbert](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune): I would love to read this, but sadly my bookstore will probably only sell it when the actual Dune movie comes out, with a bookcover that looks like the movieposter. :/

- [The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo): I *need* that book in my life!


There are of course a whole lot of other suggestions, but since I'm not the biggest reader, these books seem like a good way to start (for me atleast)!

I also think that I need to move to another country. I don't seem to be able to find the books I truely want to read... The books I do find, are expensive and badly translated. Don Quixote costed me a fortune (as a student), just because it was translated (it was hilarious though).",normal
"Posts from men expressing surprise and delight that they enjoyed a ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs book‚Äù are not heartwarming posts‚Ä¶ they are disturbing. Yes, this is partly in response to the recent *Little Women* post, but more broadly about similar posts I have seen here that always seem to get a lot of attention and praise and many comments I‚Äôve seen over the years. 

Like so many other teenage girls in high school, I had to read and relate to 95% male-centric stories written by men. I never questioned why we were reading so many ‚Äúboy books‚Äù because the books were not presented as ""boy books,"" they were just presented as normal literature. The curriculum at my school allowed for just a smidgeon of diversity with *Pride and Prejudice* and *The Scarlet Letter*. This was never seen as an issue; it‚Äôs just how it was. I still remember clearly hearing the boys in my small class groaning about having to read a ‚Äúgirl book‚Äù when we started *Pride and Prejudice*. The fact that the author was a woman or the main characters women or some combination of those two facts in the boys‚Äô minds was enough to make them sneer at it. It was mildly annoying then, but deeply infuriating and sad now looking back on it years later. Maybe, just maybe, if some of the great female authors and female-centric stories that have been written throughout history had been a part of our Literature curriculums starting from a young age and this was presented as NORMAL, we wouldn‚Äôt have high school boys joking and sneering at having to read a ‚Äúgirl book.‚Äù

You can see the same scenario when men discover that movies like Mean Girls and Legally Blonde are, in fact, great movies. There was a post like this too recently on the movies subreddit. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think I would like a chick flick, but it‚Äôs actually really good!‚Äù Turns out that women are just people, and stories about them and the things they go through are equally as valid and worthy of being told. What a mind-blowing concept!

The way these statements are phrased as such delightful revelations makes me cringe, and then I feel sad, and then I feel a bit angry, because on some level, whether subconsciously or consciously, the driving force behind these sentiments and posts is that women are ‚Äúother.‚Äù They are not the standard human, they are not fully-fledged standard human people in the same way that men are, so their stories and stories written by them are a sort of ‚Äúspecial interest‚Äù sub-category of women‚Äôs fiction. ‚ÄúGirl books.‚Äù ‚ÄúWoman‚Äôs book.‚Äù ‚ÄúChick-flicks.‚Äù 

Consider this hypothetical scenario and how utterly ludicrous it sounds to us:

*‚ÄùAs a middle-aged woman, I didn‚Äôt think I would be able to enjoy *Lord of the Flies*. I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to be a boy so I didn‚Äôt think I could possibly relate to these characters and their struggles, but I actually really enjoyed it! Even though it‚Äôs about male characters, I found the story to be really great overall and dealing with deep themes. It‚Äôs not just a boy book, it‚Äôs great literature!‚Äù*

See? Sounds pretty damn ridiculous, doesn‚Äôt it? 

Girls and women are perfectly capable of viewing male-authored/male-centric stories as just normal good literature because that is the way it is presented to us from a young age all the way up to older education. This is how we are conditioned (with no real choice in the matter), while boys and men are never forced to view female-authored/female-centric stories the same way. 

So, next time you see on of these posts, I‚Äôm not calling for us to be rude and antagonistic to the OPs, because what they are doing is technically good I suppose, but I dislike the way they are wanting a pat on the back and upvotes simply for viewing women‚Äôs stories as good valid literature worthy of being read.

It is sad and disturbing that women continue to be seen as the ‚Äúother‚Äù in fiction, a sub-category separate from the established standard of ‚Äúgood literature.‚Äù 

There is no logical reason other than deeply engrained misogyny in society why a man should be that surprised that *Little Women* is a good book. It‚Äôs sold millions of copies, had tons of adaptations, is extremely well-known and deeply beloved by people all over the globe. It should not be that surprising that this ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs book‚Äù is in fact, just a good piece of literature regardless of the gender of author or characters. Women are literally just people, and their stories are equally as worthy of being told and read as male stories. We are all part of the same humanity. 

The sentiment of ‚ÄúWow, this isn‚Äôt just for women, it‚Äôs actually a good story!‚Äù carries the not-so-subtle implication that things that are ‚Äúfor women‚Äù are inherently lesser. They are seen as a separate sub-category other than the standard that can sometimes achieve ‚Äúgreat literature‚Äù status despite their femaleness. The surprise expressed by men who find these stories to be great implies that their perception shifted, they believed something about the ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs book‚Äù before, and now believe something different having read it.

I am 25 now, so I don't know how things are in high schools nowadays. For anyone who does know, are the English Lit curriculums more balanced now or is it still the vast majority of male author/male story? I'm very curious to know. 

I want to hear your thoughts on this matter.

Edit: Huge thank you to the commenters that actually read my post (something that is too much to ask for many people I guess) and understand what I‚Äôm saying. This comment from u/SchrodingersHamster is probably buried so I‚Äôll highlight it here: 

‚ÄúRight, I doubt anyone is sorting by new here anymore but SO many people are missing the point of this post.

OP is not ""discouraging"" men from reading women's literature. Read the post again. She is focusing specifically on the idea that, from a man's perpsective, women's literature being good is surprising, so surprising that it warrants a post on how surprising it is. That the expectation that women's literature (and art in general) is so much lesser than men's that it becomes a shock when a man reads it and enjoys it.

It is NOT OP's responsibility to ""encourage men"" to read women's books. The fact that so many men are unwilling to read women's literature is an issue brought about by patriarchal assumptions that men should be sorting out, not women. Women don't need to hold our hands, guide us to all the great female writers, pat us on the back and give us a gold star when we enjoy it. It is not their responsibility. It is ours as men.

OP should not be praising these men. In fact OP, along with the rest of us, should be criticising these mindsets. We should look at these posts through a critical lens, otherwise how are we supposed to move forward? There are plenty of people on this comment section who would much rather OP kept quiet and that the issue is never highlighted or solved, simply because it might be too upsetting for men to read. If you're a man and that's really how you respond when reading this post, grow up.‚Äù",normal

"I just finished the Lord of the Rings trilogy for the first time... I'm at a loss for words Wow. Just wow. I've grown up watching the movies because my dad is a HUGE Tolkien nerd (translated Sindarin on his own lol). He read me The Hobbit when I was little, and I read the Silmarillion a while back on his recommendation. But until now, I'd never read the actual trilogy because I thought the movies were good enough.

I was so, so wrong. I finished the last chapter at 2am last night after a 6 month journey through the amazing world that Tolkien has crafted. In that time, the world has fallen apart, I was broken up with, left college, and I've been searching for where I want my life to go from here. Perhaps it's the fact that my own journey has been so hard during this time that the books hit me with such enormous emotional power, but I feel as though the world has been changed. Last night, as I said goodbye to the characters and world, I found myself crying. So much of their journey has been my own in these last 6 months, and I could never describe the joy and sorrow I felt as I turned those last pages.

There is an element of safety in fantasy, since you know it isn't real. But for me, the journey has not quite ended, and it is real. This trilogy has given me faith in a happy end, however. And I can thank Master Samwise for that. ""It‚Äôs like in the great stories Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn‚Äôt want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened. But in the end, it‚Äôs only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.""",normal

The way Arthur reacts to his life being changed so dramatically while at the same time being made to feel so small and insignificant in a universe that is chaotic and outright doesn't give a damn helps to remind that this bad period too will pass.

"I bought the same book i sold almost 5 years ago, and I found my mother's last words to me. Some may find this as crazy as I did. It's a little long but it's worth it 

My mother and father divorced in 2010, this is when my mother began doing meth. She was in an out of jail a couple times and in febuary of 2013 my mom commited suicide in her jail cell. No letter was ever left. No final goodbye to her 14 year old daughter. Nothing just silence. I may have discovered the last thing my mother ever left to me. So get this... when my mom went to prison the first time she was there for 9 months. After she got out she gave me a bag of books to read. Books that might help me get why she was there.¬† Or things she thought i would love. She would read them and highlight specific passages in pink highlighter. Things she wanted to say to me but didn't know how.¬† One of those books was the house of leaves. It was nibbled on in the right corner and had some paint on it. I carried the book for a while but never read it due to its complexity. I sold it to half price books on hulen in 2014. Last week i went to the half price books in Arlington one I had never been to. I bought the house of leaves. And it too was nibbled on in the right corner and had paint. I shrugged it off doubting it could possibly be the same book. I started reading it and now I can't seem to stop. There have been more than a few coincidences at this point. I started skimming thru the book out of boredom... and I found passages highlighted in pink... and one of the passages read..

"I feel sick and disgusted after reading Matthew's Pery memoir Could you *be* any more delusional and self-serving as this man? I loved him in *Friends* and for a long time was feeling very sympathetic towards him and his struggles, addiction can get to the best of people and I do admire those who keep fighting. But this book was something else. A blatant lack of self-awareness, narcissism and inflated ego was just too much.

This is the man, who admits he cheated on basically each of his girlfriends, yet at the same time thinks ""he's a very good person, he would never hurt anyone and God can see this"".

This is the man who hurt and drove away those who helped him the most, those who spent months with him in hospitals and rehabs, risking their careers and private lives, and suddenly were disposable when he was discharged because ""as long as I'm sober, I don't need them any more and now they're needy"".

This is the man who constantly shits on every person more successful than him. Who thinks that every bad thing that happened to him must be the fault of someone else. That he's not even in the slightest responsible for how his life looks like, because ""it's a disease, and you're lucky you don't have it, woe is me, I don't have any control over it"". Who destroyed so many movies because of his addiction, and once just disappeared for 6 months during the production to go on a binge and later detox, and is in absolute shock they sued him for financial loses. ""How could they, it was health issue??"". Who hurt every woman he's every been with, but when his ex (!) informs him she's getting married and won't be able to attend his play he says ""her emailing me about it is the worst thing someone has done to me, I would NEVER do that to a person, how could she"". The whole book is just constant self-serving ""me, myself and I, why everyone around me is always wrong and why all I did to myself and other people is not my fault"". I was physically ill by the end of this book.

The narcissism is so obvious it's not even funny. Early in his career his supposed friend rejected role of Chandler, which he obviously later regretted seeing how it played out for Matthew. What Perry has to say about it? He just randomly quotes a journalist saying that it was a blessing to the world it was Perry who was cast and that his friend would be a shitty Chandler anyway. Who the hell would do something like that to a friend? Did you just kept this quote memorized for 20+ years or went out of your way to locate any negative comment about your friend to include this in your memoir? Absolutely shocking. More on narcissism - he writes his first play in 10 days and self proclaims it as ""great work better than classics"" and gets all annoyed that it was demolished by critics. Did it ever occur to him that maybe it wasn't that good and he could work on it more? Of course not, critics just don't understand his genius, and besides, here's one semi-positive review he found - proceeds to quote it in its entirety. Yes, quoting passages praising Matthew Perry takes quite big portion of this book.

As for his addiction, this is something that happens to him against his will, he would love to trade places even with homeless or broke people, they don't get how hard he got it in life with his addicted brain. He'd love to stop, but when even the slightest hardship happens in his life, he just has to drink or use. It's just how his body works, not his fault, you're lucky if you don't have this disease. People who overcame addiction? Oh, they had it easy, easier version, easier to overcome, lucky bastards. He's one of the few that got the hardest version and he's a hero for living with it every day.

I could go on, but let's stop here. If this was a work of fiction, I'm certain people would find it almost unbelievable. You can't be that dense and oblivious to all of your faults, this is just bad writing. But here we are - the person who carefully made sure to only surround himself with yes-men is unable to see or admit he is the only constant in every situation that he messed up. What a surprise. Good luck with sobriety with the attitude of constant whining and looking for others to blame, you'll need that, Matthew.",normal

"Every time I re-read Walden, I get more frustrated about the sheer number of high school english teachers who assign it to impressionable youth without even understanding Thoreau's points. I've read Walden four times in the last ten years. I re-read it whenever I feel like I need recentering or if I need something to take me out of today's problems (many of them today which caused my fourth re-read) and it upsets and frustrates me thinking of the thousands of high schoolers who graduate every year being unintentionally (or intentionally?) misled about the points Thoreau was trying to make by clueless english teachers.

**This part of my argument is anecdotal**: in all of the english classes in my high school, and even in music history classes at undergrad, teachers and professors so readily dismiss and mock the points they think thoreau is making when in reality it's not what he's arguing. Some examples:

'It's just cabin porn''He tells everyone to be self-reliant then has his mom do his laundry'

'He tells everyone that he lived alone in the woods for three years but he didn't'

'He shit talks college despite having a degree from harvard'

'He just wants everyone to give away all their stuff and hoe beans all day'

I could go on, but I think enough people get my point and remember these sorts of dismissive, snide remarks about Thoreau. The reality is: none of these were points Thoreau was trying to make, and the worst part is that the misunderstood points he was making are actually proving to be the root of the problems of today's society. He has a whole freaking chapter dedicated to talking about visitors, his preface tells people quite clearly that his intention wasn't to go three years without human contact (quarantine is showing all of us this would be unreasonable for us to expect of someone anyway), he let his mother do his laundry because they had a loving relationship and she wanted to help him, and you know why he didn't spend all three years in the cabin? Because he felt that it was unjust to hide in the woods while people were still allowed to own slaves. He left to help fugitive slaves in Concord because Thoreau was also a fervent abolitionist.

So what did Thoreau want? Here are \*my\* five biggest take-aways from reading Walden

1. He wanted people to live more simply. He thinks we get too attached to the 'surface' of things and never question what's beneath which leads to materialism and sensationalist news influencing our world to a negative outcome. Sound familiar?
2. He believed people should spend more time in nature. Not once did he preach that we should all go live like animals forever and eschew society - he argued that people would benefit from living in nature fronting only the bare essentials of life so they may return to society as better, more sensitized people. Living with nature, we see what matters and what's important \*cough\* climate change\* cough\*
3. He believed education needed reform and rethinking as its the most important part of a child's development. He believed retreating to nature for truth was the most direct route to de-colonizing and that educating the youth in nature and village rather than schoolhouse and university was the most wholesome way to teach children to think for themselves and be liberated from capitalism‚Äôs death-grip on the educational system. Maybe this is why high school teachers tell us all to think he's a quack because of the reality that the educational system has some pretty glaring weaknesses?
4. He wanted everyone to speak truthfully. ""Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth"" he didn't want frivolties - he wanted everyone to only speak with sincerity and from the heart. He didn't want to hear about news from Texas while talking to someone in Concord, he wanted to hear what someone's dreams and ambitions were and he wanted all of us to embody the truth and honesty in life rather than the gilded edges.
5. He believed the way our economy was set up kept downtrodden people on the bottom without time to better themselves, because if people on the bottom had the time to learn how to better themselves then the whole system would collapse resulting in a better world. Same argument is used today: the bottom percent is unable to get our of the bottom percent, so bad people stay in power and good people stay in submission because they need money to pay bills.

My point here is not to have everyone drop what they're doing and read Walden or get a Thoreau bust to kiss every morning. My point here is that I really \*really\* dislike the way Walden is taught to impressionable youth. I have friends from all over the country who have had similar experiences with Walden in high school, then I get them to read it again in their 20s, and they get similarly frustrated with how their teachers mishandled his book as a way to shit talk breaking away from capitalism and the less-rosy parts of modern life as something for nutjobs.

The reality is that we need Thoreau's ideas now more than ever. If we had listened to Thoreau, maybe life wouldn't be shit wall-to-wall in America right now. He was against authoritarianism, he was against rampant industrialization for the sake of industrialization (""If everyone lives a simpler life then who will build the railroads?! \[paraphrased\]), he was a firm believer in living with nature, and he was a firm believer that living a simpler, literature and nature- based lifestyle would lead to a healthier society.

You can think I'm a quack too if you want, but Thoreau was right about almost everything and today we suffer the consequences of decades of high school teachers teaching Walden to our youth without even understanding the point of it. I would like to end with a great quote from Walden.

‚ÄúI learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.‚Äù

I want you to tell me who needs to hear this more than a room full of teenagers. But please, let's keep telling our youth that Thoreau the abolitionist and environmentalist was full of shit.

Over the better part of the past decade I've collected names of books and notable lists of best Sci-Fi and have been slowly increasing the number of books I've read that are considered the best of my favourite genre. It's been great and I have no intention of stopping!

About 2-3 years ago I decided to take on [Reddit's most recommended Sci-Fi](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/fiction#wiki_science-fiction). There were several books that I'd already read, and a bunch I'd never even heard of, and since I'm a Redditor, and the list overlaps with a lot of other lists that I mentioned above, I decided I'd go for completion. Ultimately It's a partial completion, since some of the recommendations are for a full series and there are some that I only read Book 1 rather than the whole series, but with that one caveat, as of the other day, when I made it to the last page of *The Book of Ler*, I have officially completed the list!

I'd never heard of Vernor Vinge so it's one of those books that when I'd see it on a list, it just never stuck out for me. Basically, it blew my mind. It's rare to come across the perfect triple threat of world-building, plot, and characters but I don't think I'd be over-stating it if I said this one got high marks on all three. It is now one of my favorite books.

**Book of the New Sun** inspires ambivalent feelings. I read *Shadow & Claw* which is actually 2 of 4 books in the series. If I'd stopped after the first book, I'd probably have just written it off as not my thing/overrated and moved on, but I finished the second, and while it never fully drew me, by the end I was interested in finding out more about what was going on. I might read the rest of the series, but it holds a weird place for me where I have interest without enjoyment.

**Cloud Atlas** is a great example of interesting writing. I'm probably not alone in having difficulty staying immersed with the frequent change in setting, but I can say that once I got through the first half, I couldn't put it down. 

**The Mote in God's Eye** was... interesting. I wanted to call it out because it has some issues that I've been running into a lot with sci-fi from the 60s and 70s that's increasingly difficult to ignore. *The Mote in God's Eye* features a single female human who serves 2 purposes: to be a love interest and to explain (a super conservative version of) human reproduction to aliens. I guess I'm supposed to overlook that and just enjoy the story about aliens, but I have a hard time believing that in 1974 neither of the two authors knew what they were doing when they included a passage explaining why there were no women allowed on space missions.

**Red Mars** is just awesome. I can't remember if I read it before or after I committed to this list, but it stands out either way. It's a legitimate must-read in the genre and since I've read the trilogy, I intend to read more by Kim Stanley Robinson.

**The Saga of Seven Suns** is one that I was not familiar with (although I've read several books by Kevin J. Anderson) and wasn't sure what to expect. I only read the first book, but I'm definitely open to reading the rest at some point. There's a lot of world-building and it promises to be a large epic the likes of which you typically expect in the Fantasy genre. It's not my favorite on the list, but it's certainly enjoyable enough and introduces some interesting ideas about aliens and interstellar diplomacy. 

Thanks for reading my mini treatise :)

"My grandfather's book is terrible, and I don't know what to tell him. Hey book people of Reddit. I have a problem.

My 84 year old grandfather is writing a novel, and has asked me to help edit it and give ""candid comments."" I'm 100 pages in, and objectively, it's a terrible book. The writing is bad, the dialogue is completely unbelievably, as are the characters, the story is uninteresting, the chronology is all confused, etc. I have literally nothing good to say about it.

My grandfather is a very smart man (attended Columbia and Yale), and he thinks very highly of himself and his writing abilities. He refuses to take a writing course or join a writer's workshop (""Why would I do that? I know how to write!""), and I know that he's going to ask me about it, expecting a glowing review. And I don't know what to do.

On the one hand, it'll never get published so it kind of doesn't matter if I tell him it's great to make him feel good. On the other hand, he does want to write something good, and I don't want to completely lie to him.

Anyone out there ever experienced something similar, or have any advice? Much appreciated :)

Edits:
1. Holy crap Reddit, thanks for all the responses! I really appreciate all the input, and couldn't have ever imagined that this would make it to the front page of Reddit.
2. The book is about four boys on a baseball team who become friends, and the ways that their lives remain entwined in their adulthood.
3. Part of the problem is that my grandfather did publish a novel a few years ago, which is partly where his ego in relation to his writing ability comes from. It wasn't great, but it was better.
4. I think what I'll most likely do is a combination of your various advice: lie a bit about it being better than it is, then soften my main criticisms as much as possible. Again, thanks to everyone! ",normal

"Having a library card as an adult is one of the most liberating feelings The Parks and Rec department staff would hate me for saying this but I don't care, I *love* the library. 

I work a typical 9-5 job, 40 hours a week and between work, going to the gym, cooking my own meals, cleaning my home, attending social events and all else, life gets busy so fast. 

Being someone that adores reading, having a library card is THE BEST. I don't always have the budget to buy a brand new book, or the time and energy to find a good epub version of my to-read books but the library is a place I can go to and get free books at my leisure, FREE. Most of the time I can extend my loan and have the books for over a month. 

I don't know why people don't read more, it shuts down my crazy mind and allows for another world, another view, to take over for awhile and to me, that's freedom.

That's what the library gives me, free books and freedom. Seriously, everyone should go at least once a month. It's therapeutic.",normal
"I'm dyslexic so reading has always been hard for me. I read half of a book to completion for the first time in my life yesterday and it felt amazing. I'm 35 years old and have struggled with dyslexia and ADD my whole life.  Reading for more than 20-30 minutes at a time often becomes both physically and mentally distressing for me.  I often have to re-read entire paragraphs or pages because I was thinking about something else, or I will mis-read a word that changes the sentence and confuses the hell out of me.  My eyes will often cross or go blurry which can sometimes lead to headaches.  Because of this, reading an entire novel will typically take me weeks or months to complete. 

Yesterday I sat and read the entire 2nd half of The Eighth Guardian by Merideth McCardle in a single sitting and it felt amazing.  Her 1st person writing style kept my ADD in check as it was constantly on to the next revelation, or experience, without feeling hectic.  I was so thoroughly engaged in the story of time travelling spies that I immediately went and bought the other two in the series.  Dyslexia still reared it's ugly head a few times but I was able to power through it for the first time in my life. 

After feeling like giving up on reading so many times in my life, it seems that all it took was the right book to make me realize that I could do it too.",normal
"On January 1, 2019 for the first time in more than 20 years, copyrighted works will enter the public domain. Here is how to use your send to kindle email address to add free ebooks from Project Gutenberg (or elsewhere) to your kindle library The good news here is you only have to set this up one time - it is rather confusing and many many people miss the step of whitelisting the email they will be using to send books to their kindle. 

If you want to find more free ebooks or see what is uploaded to public domain sources over the next few days subscribe to r/FreeEBOOKS.

[Here is an article about the release of works to the public domain](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/first-time-20-years-copyrighted-works-enter-public-domain-180971016/)

[Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) is one of the main sources for free public domain ebooks.

Ebooks added this way will sync across devices like any ebook you get from Amazon. 



Please ask questions in the comments below if you are having trouble figuring this out - I plan to edit the instructions as I find where folks are confused. 


# 1 - Find your send to kindle email address

First you need to find your send to kindle email address. There are two ways to do this on your kindle or on the Amazon website, it‚Äôs way easier to find on your kindle.  


**Easy way: On your kindle: Click the gear icon -> All Settings -> Your Account -> your send to kindle email will be listed on this page.**


Harder way: Go to [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) then click Accounts & lists-> 

https://i.redd.it/up315qw13h721.jpg

 


under ‚ÄúDigital content and devices‚Äù click ‚ÄúContent and Devices‚Äù -> 

https://i.redd.it/bfxxh6a53h721.png

 


Click ‚ÄúDevices‚Äù in the menu near the top ->

https://i.redd.it/94bpbnx63h721.png

 


click the ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù next to you kindle in the device list you see on that page. Your send to kindle email will be listed in the small box that appears.  If you are on mobile you will see a gallery of images of kindles and app icons - click a kindle and you will see your send to kindle email address displayed below.  

https://i.redd.it/id3hyxh83h721.png

 


(Do not be alarmed if you see a shitload of devices listed, every time you download the kindle app on something it counts as a device - I have ‚Äúdevices‚Äù going back for many years of phones) 

Your send to kindle email address will be some variation on your name + @kindle.com



 

# 2 - Make sure the email you will be sending emails from to your send to kindle email address is whitelisted. If the email you send books from to your kindle is not white listed you will never get the books.

 

On [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) click ‚ÄúAccount & Lists‚Äù -> 

https://i.redd.it/6uzd07wj3h721.jpg

 

under ‚ÄúDigital content and devices‚Äù click ‚ÄúContent and Devices‚Äù ->

https://i.redd.it/0sbp037l3h721.png




click ‚ÄúPreferences"" in the top bar of that page -> 

https://i.redd.it/33gegntn3h721.png

 

Click ‚ÄúPersonal Document Settings‚Äù -> 

https://i.redd.it/xv33a2eq3h721.png

 

find ‚ÄúApproved Personal Document E-mail List‚Äù on that page -> make sure the email you will be using to send books to your kindle is listed there.  

https://i.redd.it/cyzhtkor3h721.png




# 3 - Let‚Äôs send a book.  

 

Go to a book on [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=downloads) \-> click either Kindle (with images) or Kindle (no images) to download the version of the ebook you would like to send to your kindle. 

https://i.redd.it/8r8zroxw3h721.png

 

Now open a new email message - fill in your send to kindle email address in the to field, then drag the book file into the email. Click send.  

Go to your kindle library and sync to make sure the book downloaded.  

I typically send ebooks to my kindle from my phone or iPad - you will follow the same process but often when you download a file your device will ask you what you want to do with the file - just choose email and send away.

"‚ÄúAtlas Shrugged‚Äù Really Isn‚Äôt All That Great Let me explain.

I‚Äôve been reading about 50 pages of it a day for a while now, and I gotta day, it‚Äôs not all that it‚Äôs acclaimed to be.

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt dislike the ideology, per say. I mean, I don‚Äôt prescribe to Ayn Rand‚Äôs world views, but that‚Äôs not the reason I don‚Äôt like it. In fact, I often really enjoy alternative perspectives in writing. It‚Äôs just that she‚Äôs so blunt about it. I dunno - maybe that‚Äôs the reason a lot of people like it! I just find it so unsatisfying to read two or three times a page about how great monopolies are and how much government sucks.

If you want me to believe what you‚Äôre writing, you have to sell it to me. What makes George Orwell so great is his ability to clearly state a message, yet also thinly veil it in symbolism and metaphor. It makes it feel genuine, not forced. Ray Bradbury does the same thing with ‚ÄúFahrenheit 451‚Äù. The world feels natural, as does the message.

For ‚ÄúAtlas Shrugged‚Äù, though, it‚Äôs just not. The line between good and bad is so black-and-white it‚Äôs cliche, and not in a clever way either.  All the characters speak in the same way too. They literally sound like they‚Äôre all the same person. Furthermore, it‚Äôs not just that the characters sound the same; all the protagonists practically have the same features!

I‚Äôm going to describe a character, and you‚Äôre going to have to tell me which one it is: They‚Äôre gaunt, have steely blue eyes, and a cold demeanor. Who is it? You can‚Äôt tell me, can you. THEYRE ALL THE SAME. 

It‚Äôs really frustrating because people kept telling me how good this book was going to be. I usually love political-fiction. It‚Äôs my favorite genre, in fact. So why is this so terrible? I mean, I‚Äôve kept reading because it‚Äôs so bad it‚Äôs almost kind of good, but then it just keeps going back to bad. I‚Äôm honestly disappointed.",normal

To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. 
To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.* - A critique of political office as old as the office itself

* *He hoped and prayed that there wasn't an afterlife. Then he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasn't an afterlife.* - This one always seemed to show a great understanding of some of the illogical parts of modern idicum.
* *This man is the bee's knees, Arthur, he is the wasp's nipples. He is, I would go so far as to say, the entire set of erogenous zones of every major flying insect of the Western world.* - I don't actually know why I like this one so much!

"Am I the only one who finds random, graphic sex descriptions in otherwise ""normal"" books jarring? So, I was recently re-reading *Altered Carbon* by Richard Morgan. It's mostly violent, nihilistic, cyberpunk stuff, which was what I was there for, but it also has like one sex scene a few pages long that reads like smut.

I found myself skipping through it because I wasn't particularly interested in being titillated, so the section just felt sort of awkward.

Are these sorts of reactions to smut inserts common? You also see this sort of stuff in TV shows frequently.",normal
"Does anyone else feel the need to rush through action scenes in books in fear of ""losing the moment""? Whenever I get to the climax of an action scene in a book, I start reading it really really fast to follow the same pace as the fight/discussion is suppose to take. I get myself skipping sentences, or even paragraphs at times, if in the middle of a crucial dialogue, the narrator starts describing the body language of the characters or things that come to their minds. 

I sometimes miss on essential information because of that and I have to go back when I finish reading a chapter to get a fuller picture of what just happened. Does anyone else do the same? If so, what are your  strategies for dealing with the ""extra"" information (i.e. sentences other than the dialogue or description of fight) when reading an action scene for the first time?

EDIT: I'm really glad I'm not the only one who does this.",normal
"Does anyone else get so excited and impatient with reading their book that when a moment of revelation is coming you have to stop yourself from jumping ahead on the page? I have had this issue with books for as long as I've been a reader. I get so excited when I'm reading, knowing a great part will be coming up, that I have to physically put my hand over the bottom of the page (or wherever it is coming up) to stop myself.  

I had it happen last night while I was re-reading (for about the tenth time) Count of Monte Cristo. I know what is coming up, but I just so desperately want to get to the next action point that I could feel my eyes wandering.  

Of course, if I'm the only person with this issue, then maybe I should go talk to a therapist.  /endnerdrant",normal

"Thank you to Neil Gaiman for Norse Mythology. I was just held hostage by two young girls (8/10) until I finished the book. Watching my youngest reenact the battles of Ragnarok was magical. I really like Neil Gaiman as an author and look forward to all of his new books.  I ended up getting Norse Mythology because I thought it might an interesting read and my girls saw it and wanted in.  We ended up reading a chapter/story every night and they couldn't get enough of it.  Last night we came to the ending story of Ragnarok and they were totally entranced.  I try and do voices and act out things when I read to them and my youngest took it a step farther by acting out the battle in her room while I was reading.  Experiences like this make being a parent special.  

I found that the writing was really easy to get into.  It felt like I was an old storyteller relating long lost legends to a new generation (which I guess I was).  I really hope that he decides to tackle other mythologies because I would love to be able to share more old stories with my kids.

"Why is so much of the high fantasy genre slow paced and requires you to read 300-500 pages before something is happening with the plot?

"People who discourage kids from reading books for dumb reasons I volunteer at my local library, and I've seen this happening a lot. A kid picks a book, and the parents find a reason to give it a fault. Either it has too many pictures, or no pictures at all, or it's ""not your thing"", or it's too long or too short. It's even worse when they say it mockingly.

From time to time I try to intervene and say something in the lines of ""hey, I happened to have read this book with my little sister, and I found it really good"" to try to convince the parents to let the kid read the book, but I don't do that too often because no one likes strangers bringing in their unsolicited opinions. 

I started reading when I was 11, and it was the diary of a wimpy kid. I was going grocery shopping with my family and instead of going to the toys aisle with my sisters as usual I decided to take a look at the books (even though I had no interest in books at all). I happened to find the book cover interesting and was immediately hooked in in the first sentences. It was funny and easy to read. Five years later I was reading the picture of dorian gray in english even though it was my third language.

Everytime we see a kid with a book, we should let them know they're doing good. I would say there are exceptions, but those refer just to objectively bad books. Outside of that, there aren't many bad books, *especially* for kids. Let them read what they find curious, let them find joy in it and let their interest grow. I'm not saying parents shouldn't do anything, but at this age it's important to let kids have fun with such a healthy hobby.",normal

Highlights: 

Americanah: This was captivating! Achidie‚Äôs sharp observations were really great to read. It took me a good amount of time but it was so enjoyable and worth it. This was probably my favorite in the list!

Unaccustomed Earth: Simply beautiful. This book was such a treat. Lahiri‚Äôs ability to write with such depth and insight about people and their relationships made this really stand out.

Low: The Child Finder. Ugh. I live in a small town. I had trouble relating to the commentary on small towns and their dynamics. Simply put, this book seemed a bit shallow and was my least favorite.
 
Not a low but a CREEPY: Dark Places & Baby Teeth. I could only read these during the day. These will probably stick with me for awhile. They were excellent and it helped having some thrillers on the list.

What‚Äôs next? Keep reading!! Who knows, maybe I‚Äôll get to 18 or 20 by the end of the year. 

Did you set out on a reading goal this year? How is it going? Where are you at? What has stood out to you so far?

Edit: I am overwhelmed! This community is a HUGE motivator for picking up reading again and staying interested. Thank you for all of your insights and well wishes. I‚Äôm reading all of them and will try my best to respond. Let‚Äôs keep reading!! 

Edit 2: The dates! Hopefully this will clear up any confusion.",normal

"What is with people snubbing fiction? I just attended a professional development day in my city, and the recurring remark from a large number of the speakers was that they don‚Äôt waste time with fiction books. (IE: the only books worth reading are non-fiction business books like Start With Why and Good to Great).

This enrages me. I read a lot of business non-fiction and most of it is repetitive vague garbage. I predict that AI will be writing the top selling business non-fiction in 5-10 years. 

Fiction has taught me how to be a human being. Fiction has made me a better person.

"I spent a week trying to get engrossed in a book before realizing it was Christian fiction. So, I'm a mystery/thriller guy. I like my crime stories, with cops and serial killers and races against clocks. I'm browsing my local book joint, and I spot this book called *Nightfall*. 

""Okay,"" I thought to myself. ""Cool name.""

I read the blurb, blah blah BAU Agent racing to find serial killer before he releases a virus. Ambitious jump, but sounds fun. Has a female protagonist, we need more of that in this mostly male-led genre. Female author, which also means there probably isn't a paragraph dedicated to deceased victim's corpse titties.

Book dudes, I tried. Despite the good reviews, it just felt kinda... basic? And not like, in the cookie cutter way you'd watch a procedural crime show. Like, the author had the topic thought up and said ""good enough.""

Like, the cult was called *The Circle*, they followed *The Book*, and to get out you... just say you want out. That's it. Now call me skeptical, but I think cults are a bit more complex than that. She might as well have called them *The Antagonists*.

Then we have our characters- main girl atheist, who is related to someone in the cult, a blonde Christian love interest fellow agent that *couldn't be with someone who didn't believe*, and a barrage of various white FBI guys that might as well have been interchangeable. This would be forgivable in books with complex fantasy political systems, but not a straightforward mystery.

What finally tipped me off that this book was kind of weird was this educated FBI agent berating this caretaker black Christian woman that her God is basically the same as the cult. Like, no? No educated FBI agent apart of a BEHAVIORAL unit would make that out-there claim. Not even close to being the same, that's the thought process of an angst teen atheist.

I looked up what the ACFW award was, because like a buffoon, I saw award and was like, ""that seems like a good indicator,"" and saw it stood for American Christian Fiction Writers.

Fuuuuuuuck me, so much clicked into place after that. The Christian love interest, the protagonist being a shithead to an old lady, the lack of actual cult knowledge. No wonder I felt like I was being preached to, I fucking was.

Why do I rant this? Christian writers, you need to up your game. Christian readers, you need to up your standards. I have no issue with the fact that it's Christian, I have issue with the fact that its just *not good*. Its just... lazy. And I'm reading books that are usually pretty simple to write. If I can see these issues, then there's a problem.

EDIT: I didn't write this post to shit on Christians. You're not funny with ""hurrdurr I thought you meant THE BIBLE"".  Christian fiction that treats non-Christians as bad/ugly/whatever deserves shit. Not Christians themselves.

FURTHER EDIT: Hi r/all. I'm just going to say, its been brought to my attention that the language I used was pretty dismissive of writers like Tolkien and C.S. Lewis and even Brandon Sanderson (who I didnt know was a Mormon). I should clarify I meant books that are Christian Fiction, written by Christians pushing a narrative that everyone but them is wrong. As many others have pointed out, this is an issue with Christian media many other Christians see is a problem. I apologize for making it seem like I lumped in talented writers that are Christian with these folks, but the fact remains: the Christian Fiction I'm talking about is bad/bland/boring/inflammatory towards non-Christians. Christian consumers that regularly read these books, please. Stop giving them a market. They're either pushing their warped views of the world on you, or their grifting off of you by appealing to some very tightly held beliefs. Either way, yall don't deserve that.",normal

"If you have any books you'd like to donate, please, please consider donating to your local jail I'm far from being a perfect person, and I've ended up in jail a few times in my life. As flawed as I am, I love literature with all of my heart. The books that I've read and loved have become a part of who I am, a part of myself which I nurture and cherish. Something that cannot be taken from me.

My first time in jail, I was terrified. I was 25 years old, in a new state, and doing 30 days. Jail is cruel and dehumanizing but most of all it's boring. It was such a relief to find that my county jail actually had a decent little library! I read at least one novel, sometimes two, every single day I was in that jail.

It was there that I discovered Gene Wolf's *Book of the New Sun*, now a favorite series of mine. I discovered Faulkner and Southern Gothic literature, something that I adore to this day. I read Steinbeck, outside of the scope of what they had us read in school. Reading was just about the only self care I was capable of in that awful place, and despite the best efforts of the criminal justice system, I left that place having been enriched; a more worldly and nuanced person than I was when I went in.

I ended up in jail again last month. At a different jail now, I was disappointed to find that this jail had a far smaller library, mostly John Grisham and Nora Roberts books and very little actual literature. Then I stumbled across a copy of Le Guin's *The Wind's Twelve Quarters*. I very nearly cried when I found it. Le Guin is probably my favorite author, and finding this collection of short stories was like a revelation that I would be ok, I'd survive, I wasn't truly as alone as I thought. After some digging I also found her Earthsea series, which I hadn't read, as I generally don't read much fantasy. Escaping into those books allowed me to escape my circumstances, and again allowed me to nurture that eternal piece of myself. I also had the pleasure of reading what was supposedly the first novel ever written, *The Tale of Genji*. I got to have a little bit of a reading vacation, in a world where you are expected to be crushed and humiliated.

Please, if you have books you'd like to donate, consider your local jail. The people in those walls are suffering, they are marginalized people, the very people who can be most profoundly impacted by good literature. You may be saving a life, and I guarantee that if you donate even just one good book, you'll definitely be improving one. There is nothing as powerful as a good book that gets you through a bad time.",normal

1984 just made me realise how important language is. I'm currently reading George Orwell's 1984 and it just blew my mind. Just reached the part where this character responsible for creating Newspeak explains how they plan to eradicate thought crime and wow!! I had to stop reading for a while and just starred into nothing just thinking about how growing up in a society that has no word for freedom or even the flimsiest idea that such a notion exists would affect me. The complete lack of individuality that would exist as no one is allowed to create or consume real art. The way we perceive reality is completely dependent on language... How we express ourselves...

"I‚Äôm so tired of books titled ‚ÄòThe X‚Äôs Daughter‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe X‚Äôs Wife‚Äô. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a librarian, but I feel like every second book at the moment has a title following this format and it immediately turns me off. It‚Äôs just so overdone!

*‚Ä¶it‚Äôs that familiar-sounding titles drive sales because they help give readers a small feeling of comfort when they‚Äôre contemplating which book to purchase out of the thousands and thousands available.

"Carl Sagan's ""The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark"" might be the most important book I've ever read. I've always been an avid reader of non-fiction books, especially those tailored around philosophy, the human condition, and nature. Naturally, I sought out work by Carl Sagan from recommendations and glowing reviews along the way, and I loved his work on the TV show ""Cosmos:  A Personal Voyage"" (as well as the book of the same name), but I **never** thought I'd end up reading a book *dripping* with insight into so many topics that I admire (I just finished reading today -- took me two sittings as I just couldn't stop). 

From the importance of skepticism in all things (not just in science, but life in general); the failings of human memory (false memories, implanted memories, and the power of hypnosis); the dangers of all kinds of dogma (witch-hunts, the inquisition, New Age healing, fundamentalist religion); the baloney detection kit (i.e. understanding fallacious arguments, or sensationally fallacious media stories, that use ad hoc, ad hominem, straw man, appeal to ignorance, etc... elements); and how all of this (plus more that I didn't mention) ties into the need for continual support of science, education and a literate social class that can apply these, and many other important rational methods, into our every day lives (while convincingly elucidating the wonder and awe that is all around us -- collapsing stars, quasars, pulsars, the human genome, the vibrancy of life found on Earth, etc..). 

Sagan does this in such an easy to read, down-to-earth manner that makes every topic he speaks of so easily approachable (right down to explaining the general relation between Faraday's law, electromagnetism, and Maxwell's equations, and the profound impact a couple of equations has had on our society -- things that I never thought about, or read before).

This book has re-invigorated my wonder for humanity, and our capacity to grow as a species in the face of ignorance, hatred, war, and dangerous credulity. I honestly can't praise this work enough. ",normal
"If you have issues with almost every female character out there, YOU are the sexist one  There's an astounding amount of people that seem to have issues with almost every single female character and they don't seem to realize they're the ones who have the issue.

If a female character is written as nice, she's called submissive and anti feminist.

If she's muscly and badass, she's too much like a man.

She wants to get married and have a family? Sexist.

She never wants to have children, maybe doesn't even like children? Sexist.

She's attractive? Pandering to male gaze (because fuck us queer women, amirite? We don't like looking at attractive women üôÑ). Sexist.

She's unattractive? Pandering to purity culture. Sexist.

If a male author created her, he's misogynist because he's a man, so of course he's misogynist.

If a female author created her, she's got internalized misogyny and has fallen victim to the patriarchy.

These attitudes are prevalent everywhere, but I think, from my personal experience, book communities are the worst. Some of the people here have an issue with almost every single female character, regardless of what she's like or who has written her.

If men can't write women, and women can't write women, who, in your opinion, qualifies for this apparently impossible task? Do you think female characters just can't be done right, no matter who writes them, or how they're written and portrayed?

It's getting exhausting. We as woman are people. We're as different from each other as men are. I don't see why we should be put on some kind of pedestal, or why there needs to be some kind of nitpicking about us.

These people need to just admit they have an issue with women. Yes, they. Not these authors. They.

You know that saying, if you met an asshole today then you met an asshole, but if everyone you meet today is an asshole then you're the asshole?

Same goes here.

The legitimate marketplace at Cerrajeros was busy with custom, a broad sweep of unwanted bric-a-brac for sale: discarded furniture, soda fountains, hair curlers, Kelvinator fridges.‚Äù but he changed it. So it was even more plagiarized before. You can look it up in Google and it‚Äôll show up, though it leads to a weird scam site which will try to convince you that you have a virus on your computer but I still think that counts as proof as I‚Äôm assuming the scam site simply copied an older version of his book verbatim before he sent out an update through Kindle to cover up his more blatant plagiarism.
* This also matches up to another passage from Amexica: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ lines the streets in overload quantities: sixties furniture, soda fountains, hair curlers, Kelvinator cookers and Osterizer blenders‚Ä¶‚Äù So Mark changed sixties furniture to discarded furniture and Kelvinator cookers to Kelvinator fridges. Nice.

And I found all this in an hour or two, just looking at a few of his books, and only looking at the first few pages which were available for free in the Kindle sample and typing suspicious sentences into Google. He‚Äôs probably plagiarized a lot more and hidden it with after-the-fact edits and rearranging words in a way that‚Äôs harder to check using a search engine.

Basic rule: read through one of his books and type any phrase that seems either interesting and profound or technical about matters he‚Äôs not familiar with like guns into Google in quotes. You‚Äôll probably find that he took it from somewhere else.

‚ÄúHarlequins of youth much in evidence?‚Äù Never heard that sentence before. Oh, he didn‚Äôt write it.

‚ÄúFur-trimmed Afghans?‚Äù What are those? Oh, he probably doesn‚Äôt know either. Because he didn‚Äôt write it.

‚ÄúMisty slopes of the massif‚Äù ‚ÄúMil-dot-rich reticle‚Äù ‚Äúiron girder skeleton of a building‚Äù etc.

For original prose you get clunky purple prose like ‚Äúthe sun glared down, a myriad of shafts that lanced into his eyes.‚Äù I mean, a myriad of shafts sounds like you‚Äôre talking about golf clubs or genitals. I would HOPE neither of those are lancing you in the eye.

It seems unfair that he‚Äôs reportedly sold 6 million books and is so involved in these groups while heavily plagiarizing when books like *How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life* get cancelled entirely for plagiarism. But maybe in self-publishing things just work differently. But I feel like an author who sells 6 million books should be held to a higher standard whether they‚Äôre self-published or not.

(If this was not the right sub to post something like this, then I apologize and I'll take it down. I just thought more people should know about this because it seems like most of his fans have no idea he plagiarizes.)

&#x200B;

EDIT: A previous of this version incorrectly stated that Mark Dawson wrote 20 books in 2 years. This was based on a cursory look of his Wikipedia page, where it seems to suggest he published 20 books (meaning both novels and novellas) from 2013 to 2015. However, it has been brought to my attention that many people took 'book' to mean full-length novel, not novella, and that a lot of these books had either been written previously and were just now being published, or had listed co-authors. So 20 novels and novellas with his name on them were published between 2013 and 2015 according to his Wikipedia bibliography, but that doesn't mean he necessarily wrote 20 books in 2 years. Apologies for any misinformation.

Hopefully after that blunder I still have some credibility.

EDIT 2: I‚Äôve now reached out to Vox, Forbes, the New York Times, the Guardian, and CBS News with tips.

Some people were also telling me to reach out to various YouTubers and internet personalities to see if they were interested in tweeting about it or investigating it further, but many of them have their Twitter DMs closed and only have brand emails for emailing about sponsorships and such which are only read by a third party. So if you would like to see them talk about this and you know better ways to contact them, feel free to send it their way.

But for now I‚Äôm going to focus less on getting the word out and more on finding new examples of plagiarism within Mark Dawson‚Äôs other books.

Cheers.

EDIT 3: It seems I've found another source of inspiration.

* ‚Äútree all√©es, expansive lawns, follies, knot gardens, and boxwood parterres‚Äù \[The Driver by Mark Dawson (62% of sample on Kindle)\]

If you look up even the shortened form ‚Äútree all√©es, expansive lawns‚Äù only the article and The Driver appear. Doesn't seem like a coincidence to me. The website is copyrighted for 2013, while The Driver came out in January 4, 2014, according to Goodreads. Mark does noticeably fix the spelling of all√©es though, so that‚Äôs nice.

EDIT 4: He really likes the Morgan Estate apparently.

EDIT 5:

* \[A quote by Stephen Thomas Erlewine which is available from many sources including the All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music from 2001, page 396; notably, this is also the bio for the band on iHeart\] ‚ÄúSuede kick-started the Brit pop revolution of the '90s, bringing English indie pop/rock music away from the swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions of Madchester, and reinstating such conventions of British pop as mystique and the three-minute single.‚Äù
* \[The Driver by Mark Dawson, 2014, 69% of sample (nice)\] ‚ÄúHe liked the swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions from the Madchester era and the sharp, clean three-minute singles that had evolved out of it. Suede and Sleeper and Blur.‚Äù

‚ÄúSwirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions‚Äù is a pretty generic phrase though, don‚Äôt you think? Could definitely just be a coincidence.

EDIT 6:

* \[Page 169 of Mayfair Magazine October 2013\] ‚Äúoak parquetry floor, inlaid with ebony wood, with a gilded fireplace from a palazzo near Florence, Italy, no less.‚Äù
* \[77% of sample of The Driver, published in 2014\] ‚Äúoak parquetry floor inlaid with ebony, a gilded fireplace that belonged in a palazzo as the focal point of the wall‚Äù

EDIT 7:

* \[ [http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/upper.html](http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/upper.html) \] (2013) ‚ÄúThe upper silk fabric walls that blend with the original wainscoting painted by Dutch painter Van Amstel set the unique intimately warm tone of this office that includes a private powder room and a large wood burning fireplace.‚Äù
* \[79% of sample of The Driver from 2014\] ‚ÄúSilk fabric walls blended with painted wainscoting. There was a private powder room and a large wood-burning fireplace.‚Äù

Again, it may seem like it‚Äôs not plagiarism, but think about the elements of the sentence. The word order is the same: silk fabric walls, then wainscoting, then the powder room, then the fireplace. And the powder room is specifically private, and the fireplace is specifically large and fire-burning, and the walls specifically blend with the wainscoting. Though the sentences look different, the structure and verbiage is pretty much identical. It doesn‚Äôt even seem like Mark read this once and recalled it from memory. It seems like he wrote the first quote down word for word, then looked for a way to edit it so it might not show up on an automated plagiarism checker.

There‚Äôs also another similarity with I, Sniper and Tarantula. They both contain this phrase: ‚Äúin a steady two-hand grip, trigger finger indexed above the trigger guard.‚Äù Both halves of that phrase seem somewhat commonplace, but the combined phrase is unique to those two.

Also a lot of people were saying ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how snipers operate,‚Äù and I agree that technical jargon and actions are going to be described similarly in different works. There aren‚Äôt that many ways to say someone shot a gun or slammed a door shut. But the larger context is the similarity of both scenes overall:

In I, Sniper, (1 through 5 are in the span of three paragraphs):

1. The protagonist Bob settles behind his rifle (feels the tension in the trigger, finds the stockweld, slides to the eyepiece, and sees the world through the the mil-dot-rich reticle)
2. He diddles with the focus ring until it declares the world pristine and hard-edged at five to eight hundred yards
3. He uses a Leica laser
4. He pulls out a Kestral 4000 weather station (and notes wind, humidity, and temperature)
5. He runs the data through his Palm Pilot, dials them into the scope of his rifle, then adjusts for windage
6. Then a few paragraphs later, he is alone in the world of scope, home in the feel of the rifle, the smell of the cleaning fluid, fiberglass on his cheek, his finger on the trigger

In Tarantula, (1 through 5 are in the span of two paragraphs):

1. A character called Tarantula settles behind his rifle (feels the tension in the trigger, finds the stockweld, slides to the eyepiece, stares into it and sees the trees and vegetation through the mil-dot-rich reticle)
2. He makes a minute adjustment to the focus ring until the last remnant of blur is gone
3. He uses his handheld laser
4. He takes out a small weather station (and notes wind, humidity, and temperature)
5. He notes the data in a small notebook and calculates the solutions and dials those calculations into his rifle, then adjusts for windage
6. Then a few paragraphs later, he shuts out everything except for the scope, concentrating on the feel of the rifle, the smell of the cleaning fluid, fiberglass on his cheek, and‚Ä¶ an aluminum eyepiece against his eye socket? Definitely sounds like something a real gun buff would write...

Also he seems to have taken information from a gun website basically verbatim:

* \[ [https://hermannsguns.com.au/dsr-1/](https://hermannsguns.com.au/dsr-1/) \] ‚ÄúThe folding bipod is mounted onto upper rails (above the barrel), and the adjustable horizontal front grip is mounted on the lower rails (under the barrel). The rifle features fully adjustable buttstock and cheekpiece. \[‚Ä¶\] The barrel is protected by ventilated aluminum handguard and is fitted with muzzle brake (very useful when firing full-power magnum loads).‚Äù
* \[Tarantula, 43% of sample\] ‚ÄúThe folding bipod was mounted onto upper rails above the barrel and the adjustable horizontal front grip was mounted on the lower rails, under the barrel. The rifle had an adjustable stock and cheekpiece. The barrel was protected by a ventilated aluminium hand guard and was fitted with a muzzle brake, useful when firing full-power magnum loads like this.‚Äù

I mean, is this what we‚Äôre calling research these days? Just dumping an encyclopedia article into your novel with minimal editing?

EDIT 8:

Fixed the part where I said he had sold 6 million books. Someone in the comments said the 6 million figure is for downloads which includes freebies, so the actual sales figure may be a bit different. His latest John Milton book which isn't out yet says ""Five Million Copies Sold"" on the cover, though that might just be for the John Milton series specifically. His site says, ""6 million books downloaded worldwide,"" not sold. Though his Twitter bio says ""over 6m copies sold worldwide,"" so it could be that his website just hasn't been updated as recently. I'm just going to be safe and say ""over 6 million downloads.""

Also, somebody noticed that in his newer books, Mark is using a new tactic:

* \[Never Let Me Down Again, 89% sample\] ""He opened Wikipedia and skimmed the details. It was a small resort on the coast with the locals relying on tourism to help them make their way. It was set on the edge of the Firth of Lorn, the bay reaching out in a horseshoe shape and shielded by the island of Kerrera and, beyond that, the larger Isle of Mull""
* \[Wikipedia article on Oban\] ""Oban occupies a setting in the Firth of Lorn. The bay forms a near perfect horseshoe, protected by the island of Kerrera; and beyond Kerrera, the Isle of Mull.""

All you have to do is have your character read Wikipedia in-universe so that you automatically cite your sources. Pretty good strategy, I must say. (This definitely isn't the most offensive of the evidence, I just found it funny that he just has his characters reading Wikipedia on their phones now.)

EDIT 9:

It looks like Mark Dawson has removed the Kindle version of Tarantula from Amazon, leaving only the Audible version up. He notably also did this with his novel The Black Mile, which some reviews on Amazon and Goodreads have accused of being extremely similar to LA Confidential.

I probably won't be updating this post too much, as I am pretty busy in my personal life, but I encourage people to share the information with newspapers and literary influencers and the like, and I'd also like to point out some common errors I see in articles being written on Substack and Medium:

1. Mark Dawson did not write 20 books in 2 years. (I take full responsibility for this one. Despite correcting this claim in my post, the thumbnail for this post still says it on other platforms, forever reminding me of my mistake. Ugh). Also, generally I'd say don't mention prolificness at all. It makes other prolific authors feel like you're insulting their craft.
2. Mark Dawson does not run 20BooksTo50K. Michael Anderle started it, and Craig Martelle runs it. Mark Dawson has talked at their Vegas conference as a guest speaker, but that seems to be the extent of his involvement. Generally, don't mention 20BooksTo50K at all other than to say that he's a pretty well-connected, popular author who gets invited to guest speak at conferences. The group has a lot of fans who will defend it, and obviously saying he runs it when he doesn't isn't great for your case.
3. No conspiracy theories about ChatGPT. He wrote these books 10 years ago.
4. And obviously, no insulting self-publishing as a whole, or saying that any author who finds success is a sellout. For some reason, I see a lot of people doing this. When you write about a popular self-published author, you're going to attract people who are interested in the self-publishing space. Those people are not going to want to be told that most bestselling self-published books are worthless trash. That should be obvious.

So if you'd like to help spread the story, please try not to repeat any of the misinformation listed above. It weakens our case and makes it easy for someone to dismiss an entire article based on a singular factual mistake.

EDIT 10: I got a private message from an anonymous source that I was able to verify with some more examples of pretty clear-cut plagiarism.

The Black Mile by Mark Dawson: ‚ÄúThe pistol shot was a muffled pop, flat and small and tiny in between the crumbling explosions. Charlie caught the muzzle flash of the second shot, a flare like a painted stripe across his white-streaked vision. He didn‚Äôt feel a thing. The bullet punched through his shoulder and blood started running down his upper arm. The muzzle flashed again and he felt stinging pain in his thigh.‚Äù

No Country For Old Men: ‚ÄúThe pistolshot was just a muffled pop, flat and small in the dark quiet of the town. He turned in time to see the muzzleflash of the second shot faint but visible under the pink glow of the fifteen foot high neon hotel sign. He didnt feel anything. The bullet snapped at his shirt and blood started running down his upper arm and he was already at a dead run. With the next shot he felt a stinging pain in his side.‚Äù

&#x200B;

The Black Mile by Mark Dawson: ‚ÄúCharlie loped wincing along the kerb.‚Äù

No Country for Old Men: ‚ÄúHe loped wincing down the sidewalk past the Aztec Theatre.‚Äù

&#x200B;

The Black Mile by Mark Dawson: ‚ÄúCharlie saw himself in a shop window that had somehow not been shattered by the blast. His right arm hung loosely at his side and he was limping like a cripple.‚Äù

No Country for Old Men: ‚ÄúHe saw himself limping along in a storewindow across the street, holding his elbow to his side \[‚Ä¶\]‚Äù

&#x200B;

The Black Mile by Mark Dawson: ‚ÄúHe dropped to the floor. Get up, he told himself. Get up. He‚Äôs not escaping. There‚Äôs no way. His arm flared white-hot with pain.	Ignore it. Get up. Charlie pushed himself to his feet. He crossed Savile Row with blood sloshing in his shoes.‚Äù

No Country for Old Men: ‚ÄúWhen he looked again he was sitting on the sidewalk. Get up you son of a bitch, he said. Dont you set there and die. You get the hell up. He crossed Ryan Street with blood sloshing in his boots.‚Äù

&#x200B;

The Black Mile by Mark Dawson: ‚ÄúThere was the rich tang of gunpowder in the cool morning air. Like the smell of fireworks.‚Äù

No Country for Old Men: ‚ÄúA rich tang of gunpowder on the cool morning air. Like the smell of fireworks.‚Äú

&#x200B;

The Black Mile: ‚ÄúCharlie thumbed back the hammer and triggered a wide spread: buckshot sprayed.‚Äù

No Country for Old Men: ‚ÄúHe spun with the shotgun and thumbed back the hammer and fired. The buckshot rattled off the second storey balustrade and took the glass out of some of the windows.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Also I found another comment on the accuracy, saying that ‚Äúthumbing back the hammer only makes sense if there's a live round loaded but the gun's not cocked.‚Äú When Mark Dawson plagiarized, he failed to make it so the gun had a spent round in the chamber. This is another example, like the I, Sniper example, that shows that Mark Dawson probably doesn‚Äôt research how guns actually work, but rather plagiarizes secondary sources without understanding the actual content of those sources.

&#x200B;

Obviously No Country for Old Men was written much earlier and is much more famous. Those first four excerpts are all from the same general section in the book as well. In fact, here‚Äôs the full excerpt from The Black Mile (172 words).

"If the decline of Barnes and Nobel depresses you, check out Waterstones, a UK book seller which is going from strength to strength. Waterstones is an example of how to sell books right from a national chain. Their profits jumped 80% in 2017 and that's because physical book sales in the UK are a growing market again.

The chain looked much like B&N back in 2011 but was turned around but a new CEO.  His big plan? Decentralised decision making and going back to traditional book selling practices. Here's some key quotes from the rather detailed wiki page:

> In September 2011, the bookseller announced that it intended to drop its 3-for-2 deal on books after a decade in place.[48]¬†The offer was replaced with a 'bespoke offer', based on branches choosing their own pricing structures from available discounts.[49]

>2013 saw the start of an overhaul of the company's business strategy, with centralised decision making giving way to store-based decisions and a renewed emphasis on traditional bookselling techniques.[69]

>Waterstones launched a number of new partnerships through the year, including with the¬†University of Derby¬†to launch a professional qualification programme for its staff,[73]¬†with the¬†Folio Society¬†to extend customer reach and stock selection in London-based bookshops,[74]¬†and partnering with a new charity,¬†BookTrust.[75]¬†

>In a 2016 interview with Daunt, he stated that Amazon ""defines how Waterstones acts"" and while Waterstones could not compete with the internet retailer digitally, it could offer a credible alternative, believing there was ""a future in physical bookselling.""¬†[97]¬†Waterstones continued to look at ""fixing the basics"" during 2016, such as adjusting store opening hours and harnessing data from the loyalty card[98]¬†as well as refurbishment of physical stores, including the Canterbury branch,[99]¬†and work on its e-commerce routes through improvements to product ranking.

Essentially, the company lets individual stores have a huge amount of autonomy for a national chain. This allows them to experiment and work out how best to sell books for their area. What works in one area isn't the optimal for everywhere else. They see their staff's knowledge on books as a critical business asset. Through this empowerment, they have turned the business around from a potential blockbuster to a growing business, both in number of stores and profits.

Physical books are a growing market again but you need to adjust your business model to innovate and keep on top of trends. This could be a model that B&N could use to avoid being a relic of the past.

"I don't think the ""a song of ice and fire"" will finish. I did a little math. George R. R. Martin is 73 years old. His a song of ice and fire books were realeased from 1996 until today. His longest time to release a book was book 5 (I haven't taken book 6 because it is not released). If we take distance of time the book we waited for longest (because series ending books need to connect loose ends they tend to take longer) and apply that time to now  he would be 78.

This is the most Conservative estimate of at what age the 7th book were to be released. And this calculation disregards the fact that book 6 was not released.

"Agatha Christie was born today, 129 years ago. 8 years ago, a pretty girl and I flirted over dinner, plotting and one-upping each others (and Christie's) outlandishly complex homicides. We'll be engaged soon. We like to say we bonded over murder. Happy Birthday, and thank you, Dame Agatha. My first Christie was ‚ÄòMurder On The Orient Express.‚Äô

I was 11, and, early one morning, helping a friend and his family move into his new place. The previous tenants hadn‚Äôt cleared out everything, including this huge, stinking old mattress on the 1st floor (that‚Äôs the 2nd floor for people from civilisations that haven‚Äôt yet unlocked the metric system technology). We tossed the ugly thing out of the window.

And there, hidden for god knows how long  between the fetid foam and splintered bed slats, was this slim and sorry looking paperback.

At that point I already fancied myself a ‚Äòmature‚Äô reader of refined tastes, having ploughed through about 80 volumes of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries, and ready to complete another 60 over the summer break.

Honestly, I was glad to find an alternative. It was beginning to strike me that I was increasingly frequently being able to predict exactly what was gonna happen to Frank and Joe and Nancy. It was like those books were formulaic or something.

Around 10am my friend‚Äôs parents ran out of things to give me to do., so they fed me some KFC and turned in to nap.

No one was expecting me anywhere, so I found an empty hammock at the playground and began to read. I remember hoping I‚Äôd find a racy scene or two.

I didn‚Äôt move for the next eight hours. Sun was pretty much about to set, and my bladder was about to burst. I whizzed into a large drain and walked home in a bit of a stupor. I honestly can‚Äôt remember any earlier instance of having my mind well and truly fucked.

No one‚Äôs seen me in eight hours, so they were just about to start getting worried.  I don‚Äôt think I really listened to the chewing out I got.  At some point Mum told me to go bathe before dinner.  I remember them knocking on the bathroom door, asking me if I was getting married or something coz I‚Äôd been in there for 20 minutes. I hadn‚Äôt even soaped myself.

At dinner I‚Äôm still spaced out so Dad finally asks wtf  is wrong with me and where‚Äôd I‚Äôd been.  I asked him if he‚Äôs ever heard of someone called Agatha Christie.

He, Mum and Gran all ask why at the same time.

I tell him she‚Äôs an author, and I‚Äôd spend the day reading a novel she wrote, and that she‚Äôs got about sixty more, and that I was done with those dumb Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, and that she was the only author (other than Rowling) that I wanted to read anymore, and that it was the best book ever written, and that if they hadn‚Äôt read it then I was gonna make them, coz they didn‚Äôt know what they were missing out on, and then I went on to spell out and spoil the whole plot for them.

They politely wait for me to finish before they start sniggering. Gran tells me I‚Äôm obnoxious, and Mum‚Äôs starting to laugh her head off, and Dad takes me to the master bedroom, to the bookshelf he shares with mum (which up to this point I‚Äôve entirely ignored because I‚Äôve got my own bookshelf and it‚Äôs way more interesting), and tosses down five more Christies and says I can keep them.

I remember being amazed at the sheer coincidence that he‚Äôd have books by an author I stumbled across so randomly. It‚Äôd be a few more years before I realised that  the only one who‚Äôd outsold Christie was Bill Shakespeare, and that‚Äôs coz he had a 300 year headstart.

So it turns out Mom had been reading Christie since she was 16, Dad since 14, and Gran had been reading regional translated copies of Christie since she‚Äôd been 15 back in 1951.

Dad asked me to add the book I found to my library before I forgot. Way ahead of you, Dad, coz I just then realise I forgot it in the hammock.

Five minutes later I‚Äôm back at the hammock, nearly throwing up from sprinting on a full stomach. The book was gone. Not in the hammock, not near the drain, or at any point on the way home. Crushed, I was. Gran does her Gran thing and says that was probably what that copy‚Äôs fate or purpose was: to bounce from unwary reader to unwary reader to introduce them to Christie just like  it introduced me.

Yeah, nice story Gran, but fine, I‚Äôll play.

I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm the only one of us who has read every single one of Christie‚Äôs murder mysteries though.

That was 19 years ago. Then, 8 years ago Christie served as the best wingwoman I ever had.

And earlier this morning my girlfriend and I were telling a mutual friend (who hadn‚Äôt read any of the books) what Christie meant to us. She seemed intrigued, and so my girlfriend and I are gonna buy her a book each. 

My girlfriend‚Äôs serving up ‚ÄòDeath on the Nile‚Äô, and obviously, it‚Äôs ‚ÄòMurder On The Orient Express‚Äô from me.

EDIT: Well, this became a thing overnight. What a wholesome and cool bunch you all are! Love you guys! Much gratitude for the gold, anon Redditor. 

A: Much gratitude for the many many engagement-to-be congrats. I guess this makes you guys the first to congratulate us, so you're all special to my gf and I now.

B: To those inspired by this post asking for Christie recommendations, check this list of my favourite dozen. If you like working up to the greatest stuff, read these in ascending order; read in descending order if you like starting with the greatest.

>Evil Under the Sun

>Cards on the Table

>Nemesis

>Towards Zero 

>N or M?

>Appointment with Death

>A Murder Is Announced

>Taken at the Flood

>The A.B.C. Murders

C: To those saying this belongs on r/nobodyasked: Firstly, this was the only Christie-related post on Christie's birthday. Secondly, this subreddit isn't just about talking about books; it's also about how you relate to them. So the fact that this sub exists and we're all here... well... r/everyoneasked.

D: To those saying I'm a shit/obnoxious writer: I agree, if you're saying I'm have an incomplete sense of finesse or technique. But if you think writing well has nothing to do with creating a certain reminiscence-y mood or touching folks with the feels, then y'all don't know what you think you know it means to be a writer. Whatever. Beauty in the eyes of the beholder and all that.

E: For those asking for recommendations of writers 'Similar to Agatha Christie', there aren't any, but I've got two for you anyway. If Christie's 'hook' was **'Whodunnit?'** then these two authors had 'hooks' of their own:

> James Hadley Chase. His hook is ""What happens next?"" He did for general crime - robbery, kidnapping etc - what Christie did specifically for murder. Also, his stories are told from the criminal's POV.

> Erle Stanley Gardner's Perry Mason Series: His hook is ""GUILTY or *Innocent*?"" Dramatic courtroom pulp.  These are a bit of a guilty pleasure because they're most sensational and lurid things you'll ever read.

> Bonus: Sherlock Holmes, obviously, but I'd be amazed if people didn't know who that was.",normal

#### Edit 2:

I chose most of my books from TIME magazine's list of top 100 novels of the century. Others were recommended to me by my professors or peers.


#### Edit 3:
Since many have asked about some other goals I have taken. Here's a list of my goals for this year, which is similar to last year.

One of my main objective for this year to learn to get consistent, for which I want work towards my goals everyday, and not in bursts.

Some of my goals for this year along with their daily targets are:

- To learn French good enough to read and speak with a bit of fluency by the end of the year. For that I am practicing it daily.

- Practice piano every day for at least an hour. Currently I am learning Claire de Lune, so, just want to finish learning it. Then record it and a piece by Chopin as soon as possible. As of now I haven't set my final goals for this year, just want to keep practicing.

- Read 60 to 70 novels by the end of the year for which I read a novel for at least an hour daily.

- Workout daily

#### Edit 4:

Many people seem to get an idea from my (bit misleading, which I can't edit now) title that I am now cured of depression. Which I already clarified in the post. To be clear, I still get depressed. But I have just found a way to not let it paralyze me like it used to earlier. I kept myself busy for the same reason. Hope this clarifies things a bit.

I don't claim that this is a cure for depression, I am just trying to learn how to live with it, and the thing is, it seems to work for me. People should learn to understand that what I have posted is an observation. What you interpret from it is left to you.",normal

"People who only read non fiction because ‚Äúfiction is a waste of time‚Äù is the equivalent of a gym rat who skips leg day I know a lot of people who will only read non fiction, mainly books that will equate to a more ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù life. When I ask them what their favorite fiction novel is  a lot of people tell me they don‚Äôt read fiction because it‚Äôs a waste of time and they can use that time to learn more  by reading more non fiction.
 Now to be clear if you if read only non fiction because fiction doesn‚Äôt entertain you then that‚Äôs fine. But if you are reading books for the sole purpose of bettering yourself then I feel these people are really missing a big opportunity  by not reading fiction.

"So... my boyfriend has never read The Hobbit And he‚Äôs leaving in a week for six months for work in a  pretty secluded place. 

Typically I show love by reading people the book... as it was read to me by the first person I fell in love with. So, as a gift to him I recorded myself reading it so he could listen to it while he‚Äôs away. Only took 10 hours, one minute, and 45 seconds. 

Please don‚Äôt rat me out if I‚Äôve broken copywriter laws! It‚Äôs not for profit!!!

EDIT: thanks for the awards! I shall sit on my pile of gold and silver like Smaug on his - and relish it for evermore!!

Now, to those of you who have seemed to take such an offence that I read a book to him that I was read by an old boyfriend. Sorry you‚Äôre miffed. But that was 25 years ago and I‚Äôve read the book (or parts of it at least) to lots of people - including my own kid. The ex‚Äôs parents used to read it to he and his brother, he read it to me, I‚Äôve read it to others, I hope my son will read it to people. It‚Äôs a nice book to have read to you - it‚Äôs not a once in a lifetime opportunity. 

And, for the record, this guy knows how much the book has figured in my life, and that I‚Äôve read it to others as it was read to me. And it wasn‚Äôt an issue. I, in fact, started reading it to him as he fell asleep one night and that‚Äôs when I thought I should record it so he could take it with him. My friends who know about the little project want a copy too. It‚Äôs a sweet gesture, not an original or sacred one.

EDIT TWO: many of you are asking how I recorded myself - I downloaded the app ‚ÄúDictaphone‚Äù to my iPhone (but I‚Äôm sure android has a similar version). It was a pretty easy app to navigate and I‚Äôm pretty low tech). I recorded it chapter by chapter - some were ~10 mins, others ~50. Then I uploaded the files to my google drive and put them on a flash drive which I‚Äôll give to him before he goes. And I‚Äôll tell him about all this hoopla.

I've just finished this amazing book called ""Dark Matter"" (well, at least I think it was amazing) and I can't help but think of all the material I missed out on as a kid and teen.

So far my goal for the year is 12 books (as opposed to zero per year) and I'm already 4 books in. üòÅ

I'm going to be starting The Hobbit, followed by the Lord Of The Rings and then maybe read the first Dune book. I'm also reading, along with my fictional book of choice, non-fiction to scratch my itch to learn about various subjects.

Seriously, it's like a whole new world just opened up. My boring, depressing life just got a whole lot brighter. üòé

Sorry if this post is a little aimless. I'm just so excited to read.

"One of my favourite passages in Kurt Vonnegut's [Slaughterhouse 5]  ""It was a movie about American bombers in the Second World War and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this:

American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.
The formatioin flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France, though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.

When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. 
It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again.""",normal

"Has anyone ever noticed how certain male authors talk excessively about their female character's breasts? I just started reading *Altered Carbon* by Richard Morgan, and I noticed how the introduction and description of one of the characters seemed to revolve around her breasts.

>Exuberant breasts strained the fabric of the leotard.

-

>She stood facing me, flushed, breasts rising and falling distractingly.

-

> Mrs. Bancroft‚Äôs breasts jiggled with her steps under the thin material of the leotard, and I took a morose interest in the art on the other side of the corridor.

I know it's because the author is trying to portray the though process of the main character, who is obviously focused on this woman's breasts, but it struck me as kind of funny, like ""Then a pair of breasts walked into the room. A head located somewhere above and slightly behind the breasts started saying something or other, which caused the breasts to jiggle a little bit!""

I thought about it and I've noticed that Stephen King sometimes does this too. I remembered when I was reading *Pet Sematary*, thinking it was weird how he kind of randomly started talking about an old woman's breasts:

> It occurred to him that once she had been seventeen, her breasts eyed with great interest by the young men of the neighborhood, all her teeth her own...

Then I wondered how often he talked about breasts in *IT*, so I decided to take a look:

>He struggled halfway up, leaning toward it, and then felt one of Beverly's breasts press against his shoulder as she reached over him to get it.

-

>He stood there for a moment, staring at her as if he had never seen her before. In a way he never had. Her breasts heaved rapidly.

-

>And suddenly‚Äîmaybe it was because of the utter loathing on her face, the contempt, maybe because she had called him a tub of guts, or maybe only because of the rebellious way her breasts rose and fell‚Äîthe fear was suffocating him.

-

>It was this latter Beverly who swung the belt for the last time‚Äîthe belt he had used on her buttocks, her legs, her breasts.

-

>They are in bed together during this conversation. Her breasts are small like peaches, sweet like peaches.

-

>Her hands were folded just below her breasts, as if in prayer.

-

>She clasped her hands together between her budding breasts, fluttered her eyelashes rapidly, and then laughed.

This is where I got bored of this exercise and stopped looking - I was only 30% of the way through!!

"Why You Should Not Read More Reading more is a good goal, always. However, the way that I've seen ""reading more"" being discussed, especially on the internet is...just not good. The advice that people give on ""how to read more"" is almost always terrible, such as speed ""reading"", audiobooks, skimming etc. And these are fine methods when, say, you have to go through a textbook for a test and you don't have enough time, but for reading in general, as an activity, it's just bad.

It's almost as if reading has become an intellectual status symbol in the society, and the more books you read, the smarter you are perceived to be. So the end goal is to just read as many books as you can, without regard to the enjoyment and the actual reading experience.

You'd never find a cinephile saying ""Yeah, I generally skip over some parts of film to get to the meat and like read the Wikipedia summary to help, that's just so that I can watch as many films as possible.""

People forget that at the end of the day, reading is a consumptive activity. Can it, in general, be more demanding than other consumptive activities like watching films and listening to music? Yes, absolutely. But it's still a consumptive activity, so applying the kind of strategy that one applies for doing productive work -- like how to study more, how to work more, how to practice more (an instrument, for example) is not good, in my opinion.

The best experience is to go through a book slowly. Read each and every line, and let it settle in your mind. If you like a sentence/para, or if you don't fully understand it read it twice, thrice. It's better to closely read one book per year than to skim over a hundred.

What do y'all think?

"Which Books Do You Consider A Perfect 10/10? Which books would you consider a perfect 10/10 in your eyes? It doesn't matter if it's a popular classic or if it's an underrated gem that feels like only you've read it, please just share with me the books you consider perfect and maybe a little reason why you think so. Feel free to post one book or multiple books.

For me, the books I consider perfect are Les Miserables, Don Quixote, Watership Down and The Iliad (there's bound to be more but for the time being these are the ones that pop into my head).

Les Miserables - it's tragic but also immensely life-affirming. You can't help but love Jean Valjean: for every wrong he does, he attempts to right it and throughout his life he sticks by that ethic even when it's the most difficult thing to do. There's so many characters that intertwine and interact with each other that it's hard not to fall for some of the relationships in this book too, especially Marius and Eponine. They're both clearly underdogs that were meant to be together but life just has its ways of complicating things.

Don Quixote - it's incredibly funny, with plenty of little jokes directly from Cervantes that criticises the author of an unauthorised sequel of Don Quixote that was published before Cervantes could finish the second volume of his novel. Don Quixote is both a fool and a genius. It's hard not to admire his constant determination to succeed even if his attempts are doomed to fail (the obvious example is the windmill charge but that's such a small segment of the large book: I loved the part where he confuses two flocks of sheep as two warring factions and decides to try and help both).

Watership Down - a beautiful look at environmental concerns, dictatorships, folklore and religion through the adventure of a group of rabbits in search of a new home. The adventure is full of intricacies such as stories of the great rabbit El-Ahrairah, the black rabbit of Inle, the social and gender roles of the rabbits, communication amongst different species, etc. Also that ending is going to stick with you. Very excited about the BBC series coming this December.

The Iliad - a little slow to start (but understandable as the ship catalog and soldier registry is almost like Homer's way of name-dropping the names of people in the audiences he used to orate to as well as their family members that were in the military) but once this beast of an epic poem gets going, it doesn't slow down. The violence is unflinching (two ways of tasting copper!) and it's full of Greek Gods throwing shade; soldiers' trash talking; interior politics and manipulation from both the soldiers and Gods; and an incredible tragedy (I won't spoil how the book ends for those unfamiliar with Greek mythology and The Iliad but even if you are aware of what happens, reading how it develops to that point in The Iliad is haunting and it still lingers with me a year after having read it).

TL;DR: which books do you consider perfect 10/10s? Not just the books you really like, but the books that don't seem to do any wrong at all!",normal

"After YEARS of wanting to read them but never getting past chapter 1, I finally finished Lord of the Rings today! My goodness what a journey this has been, for years I had avoided seeing the movies because I wanted to read the books first, but never got more than a few pages in cause it just seemed like such a dense read and I was never in the mindset to do it.

I sat down at the beginning of quarantine and finally started reading Fellowship very seriously, making sure I took it slow and read very closely. There were definitely parts of these books that I was more than a little bored throughout, but the parts that grabbed me REALLY grabbed me!

I had to take a good amount of breaks for a few weeks at a time, and once I even thought there was no way I was going to finish just cause it felt like way too big of a feat. So glad I pushed through cause the payoff was IMMENSE! I read the last 150 or so pages in one sitting which was so rare for me with these books. So happy I pushed through and took the time to read them, even with all the lulls I completely understand why they're held in such high regard, and everybody should give them a shot if they haven't!

Also, if you're struggling to get through a long book or series, it's totally okay - put the book down for a little bit, move on to something else, but come back to it. You'll find that a bit of a break is a really good refresher!

Edit: Should have said this, I have read The Hobbit probably 5 or 6 times since I was a kid and love it, I think it was a bit of a shock trying to read these expecting the same world from the same writer but having the writing style be so drastically different even though the world was familiar",normal

"There is a special place in hell for people whose Goodreads reviews contain spoilers and no spoiler warnings. The title of this post says what it needs to say but, in honour of the rules, I will tell you exactly why I came to post this. Be forewarned, only 49% of this post is sarcasm and, while I have no intention to offend, I also have no intention not to offend. 

Here it goes:

I opened up Goodreads for no particular reason. Just quietly scrolling and harming no one. I am on leave today and I can do whatever I like, and all I want to do is a little nothing. Tomorrow is public holiday here, so I‚Äôve given myself a really long weekend. I figured I‚Äôd keep things peaceful. I expect that was too much to ask. 

I came across a book trending in the Thriller section - _The Moonlight Child_ by Karen McQuestion. It‚Äôs got a 4.22 rating and that‚Äôs quite high, in my estimation, especially for something that probably isn‚Äôt literary fiction or destined to be a classic. (But who knows? I haven‚Äôt read it, and I could be wildly mistaken.)

Rating aside, I was intrigued by the synopsis, so I read the reviews. Well. Of course I read the reviews. Reviews are vital. A public good, written (usually) by the best among us. A well-written review is invaluable, but reading through them is a dangerous business. 

See, sometimes reviewers are just parading around as Samaritans when they are much more akin to Satan. They remind us how easy it is for vicious psychopaths to review books on Goodreads. These people are the ones that publish reviews that contain spoilers without including spoiler warnings. There is a special place in hell for them. I truly worry for their friends and family.

"A few lessons I've learned from reading 3 books about slave labor camps 5) Humans Can Survive In Horrible Conditions

>‚ÄúLike nearly all the camp inmates I was suffering from edema. My legs were so swollen and the skin on them so tightly stretched that I could scarcely bend my knees. I had to leave my shoes unlaced in order to make them fit my swollen feet. There would not have been space for socks even if I had had any. So my partly bare feet were always wet and my shoes always full of snow. 

‚Äî ‚ÄúMan‚Äôs Search for Meaning‚Äù Pg 27

The quote above comes from Viktor Frankl as he explains life at a Nazi concentration camp. He suffered from edema, which caused his tissues to swell up and made moving around torture. His feet were uncovered as he walked through snow and didn‚Äôt have a pair of socks‚Äìnot that he could wear them anyway because his shoes were already tight due to his swollen feet. With barely any clothes or gear, he and others were still forced to mine the frozen ground for ten or more hours a day. 

The only nutrition prisoners were given was a bowl of very watery soup once daily and a small piece of bread. Sometimes they were given special extra allowances consisting of a piece of cheese or a slice of poor quality sausage. 
 
Life wasn‚Äôt much better for Alistair Urquhart at the Japanese labor camps. He was given only a cup of rice and water for each meal. From constantly working in the jungle with no shoes, he developed tropical ulcers. There was a doctor in his camp but he didn‚Äôt have any medicine so the best advice he gave Urquhart was to put maggots on his foot to eat the dead skin. 

As crazy as it sounds, it‚Äôs true:

>‚ÄúI left the medical hut, shaking my head, still wondering if I were being had. Letting maggots eat my skin did not sound particularly appetizing but I was willing to try anything. I knew I had to stop the rot that was devouring my legs.‚Äù 

‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Forgotten Highlander‚Äù Pg 171

And the craziest part is it actually worked. However, Urquhart said that even years later he would sometimes get the sensation of maggots eating his skin. An unfortunate side effect, but he did live to be 97 years old. 
Alistair Urquhart, author of ""The Forgotten Highlander.""

&nbsp;


4) Survival Requires The Right Mindset 

>‚Äú‚ÄòIt‚Äôs easy for these men to give up and when they lose hope the fight just seeps right out of them. On countless occasions I have seen two men with the same symptoms and same physical state, and one will die and one will make it. I can only put that down to sheer willpower.‚Äô 

‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Forgotten Highlander‚Äù Pg 170 

Urquhart writes that he could tell which men would die by simply looking at their faces. Those with a lost gaze in their eyes didn't last long. It was in that moment that Urquhart made the decision that he would not stop fighting‚Äìeven if it required him to put maggots on his feet to survive. 

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn learned a similar lesson. 

>‚ÄúAnd the conclusion is: Survive to reach it! Survive! At any price!... This is the great fork of camp life. From this point the roads go to the right and to the left. One of them will rise and the other will descend. If you go to the right‚Äìyou lose your life, and if you go to the left‚Äìyou lose your conscience.  

‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Gulag Archipelago‚Äù Pg 302

Solzhenitsyn notes that prisoners had to make a decision, do whatever it takes to survive or fall short and die. This didn‚Äôt mean kill other people to survive, but rather it was a change in mindset. 

In his book, Solzhenitsyn writes that prisoners were allowed to take baths‚Äìwith only cold water‚Äìbut then had to endure a trip back to camp in subzero temperatures. Yet, none of them got pneumonia, in fact, they didn‚Äôt even catch a cold. 

However, when one of those prisoners was finally released and he could live in a warm home and take warm baths, he got ill the first month. The mindset of surviving at any price was not there anymore. Changing one's mindset can have an incredible impact on the rest of the body. 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, author of ""The Gulag Archipelago.""

&nbsp;

3) Slave Labor‚ÄìYou Get What You Pay For

>‚ÄúWe made constant attempts at sabotage. Men whispered orders to impair the construction of the bridge wherever possible. Some charged with making up concrete mixtures deliberately added too much sand or not enough, which would later have disastrous effects.  

‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Forgotten Highlander‚Äù Pg 188

Evil leaders have been under the assumption that slave labor is a great way to accomplish projects at little to no costs, but this is far from the truth. As Urquhart writes in his book, the prisoners did everything in their power to delay or destroy the project. They even collected termites and white ants and deposited them into the grooves of the logs that were meant to hold up the bridge. As a result, construction projects were often delayed or if it were finished, the quality of the project was extremely poor and didn't last long.

A similar conclusion can be found in the Soviet labor camps.

>‚ÄúAll they were on the lookout for was ways to spoil their footgear‚Äìand not go out to work; how to wreck a crane, to buckle a wheel, to break a spade, to sink a pail‚Äìanything for a pretext to sit down and smoke.  

‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Gulag Archipelago‚Äù Pg 293

Just as in the Japanese camps, workers would constantly find ways to sabotage the project so they didn‚Äôt have to work. Solzhenitsyn adds that the material was so poor, people could break bricks with their bare hands. 

The prisoners did everything possible to quietly foil the project so that they wouldn‚Äôt have to work‚Äìafter all, they weren‚Äôt being paid to work so they didn‚Äôt have any incentive to do so.

The prisoners were also constantly stealing project materials. Solzhenitsyn concludes the chapter by writing that the labor camps were not only ineffective, but they ended up costing the country more than if they had simply paid workers a fair wage. 

&nbsp; 

2) Life Is Unfair

>Viktor Frankl worked at a hospital as a psychiatrist, before being arrested and sent to four different concentration camps over the years.  
>Aleksander Solzhenitsyn was a decorated captain in the Soviet Army during World War II before he was arrested and sent to a labor camp for criticizing Stalin in private letters. 
>Alistair Urquhart was drafted into the army during WWII and shipped to the British outpost of Singapore before he was arrested by the Japanese and sent to one of their labor camps. 

 

None of these men were ‚Äúevil‚Äù or actual criminals. They were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. None of them deserved to suffer in the labor camps. None of them should have worked 16 hours a day of physical labor on barely any food or water in horrific conditions.

Life is simply unfair at times. Viktor Frankl does, however, offer a piece of advice should anyone find themselves in a similar situation. He writes that everything can be taken from a person, except their attitude. 

>‚ÄúEverything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms‚Äìto choose one‚Äôs attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one‚Äôs own way...It is this spiritual freedom‚Äìwhich cannot be taken away‚Äìthat makes life meaningful and purposeful. 

‚Äî ‚ÄúMan‚Äôs Search for Meaning‚Äù Pg 66
Viktor Frankl, author of ""Man's Search for Meaning.""

&nbsp;

1) Man is Capable of being a Saint & a Swine

>‚ÄúIn the concentration camps...we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behaved like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself, which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions. 

‚Äî ‚ÄúMan‚Äôs Search for Meaning‚Äù Pg 134

That is a heavy truth to swallow. Even in the concentration camps, Frankl noticed some prisoners gave their daily piece of bread to prisoners in dire need of nutrition. He also saw other miracles such as a Nazi doctor buying medical supplies with his own money and smuggling it back into camp to help the Jewish prisoners. 

Frankl ends the book by saying that man is capable of inventing the gas chambers of Auschwitz, but man is also the same being that entered those gas chambers with the Lord‚Äôs prayer on their lips. 

Solzhenitsyn came to a similar conclusion in his book.

>‚ÄúGradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either‚Äìbut right through every human heart‚Äìand through all human hearts.   

‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Gulag Archipelago‚Äù Pg 312

Solzhenitsyn spent countless hours thinking in prison‚Äìwhen he wasn‚Äôt being forced to work, prisoners sat in their cells and had nothing but their hands and their mind‚Äìand came upon the realization that good and evil exists inside every person, but they must make the decision within themselves. 

Inside every person is the struggle between good and evil, and although it is impossible to expel evil from the word, the next best thing is to constrict it within each person. That is a responsibility that falls upon each and every one of us.

"What's your favorite opening line to a book? Mine is probably the opening line to Salem's Lot: ‚ÄúAlmost everyone thought the man and the boy were father and son.‚Äù

This line tells us so much. It tells us the relative ages of the two main characters, that they are not related, and that they are currently in a place where people don't know them (otherwise, why would everyone be wrong about their relationship?). This information then leads the reader to wonder why these two guys are away from their homes. What could have driven them out? Where is the family of the boy? Why would he travel without them? 

Almost immediately, this one line immerses the reader in a dark mystery that foreshadows a potentially evil ending. Simply amazing.",normal

"When reading, I often find myself subtly acting out the descriptions of a person's facial expressions or actions. Does anybody else do this? Like, if a book starts describing something like ""he tilted his head to the side the way a dog might and gave her a friendly but curious look that said he desired her but didn't want her to know about his haunted past"", I will start tilting my head and trying to make that face to figure what the author was trying to indicate. Am I alone?

Edit: Wow! I didn't expect to wake up to so many replies. Thanks, fellow weirdos. I'm glad we've all found each other. Shout out to all the writers and artists that do this too!

Edit 2: Also, for anyone curious, I made up the terrible description above.

The irony of curating a collection tentatively titled *Rising Voices: Amplifying AANHPI Narratives* with  one hand while demanding that I strangle my own voice with the other  was, to me, the perfect encapsulation of what publishing, our dubious  white ally, does so often to marginalized creators. They want the  credibility of our identities, want to market our biographies. They want  to sell our suffering, smoothed down and made palatable to the white  readers they prioritize. To assuage white guilt with stories that  promise to make them better people, while never threatening them, not  even with discomfort. They have no investment in our voices.

"I'm totally blind, and one of my favorite authors signed a book in Braille for me Much to the bewilderment of other visually impaired people, I love to collect hardcovers of my favorite books. Something about being surrounded by the tangible evidence of the stories I love so much is beautiful and intoxicating, regardless of if I can read them that way.

I bought a signed copy of The Black Prism by Brent Weeks, and in the additional notes, I happened to mention that I'm blind. Reading has always been a reliably accessible interest.

His response was to not only sign my copy in print, but look into and successfully find a way to get the quote and signature in Braille.

I am blown away by and incredibly grateful for the thoughtfullness of a gesture that he did not need to make. I value the concept of the signed books I have, but I never imagined I'd be able to open one and truly experience it in the same way as sighted readers do.

I am so proud and grateful to be a reader. I hope so much that this is something that becomes more common.

"Just read books 1-4 of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for the first time ever. This is unequivocally the best book series I have ever read and I don't know what to do with my life now :( This is one of those series that I'd always heard about but somehow never got around to reading. Now that I have I'm wondering where it's been all my life, but also realizing that there's a lot of concepts and intelligent existential wit in it that I might not have caught onto if I had read it when I was younger. I haven't ever read anything that was simultaneously this witty, hilarious, intelligent, and original. In fact I haven't been able to put it down since I started the first book a week or two ago. It's honestly a bit difficult to put into words how brilliant this series is, in so many different ways - suffice it to say that if there was any piece of literature that captured my perspective and spirit, this is it.

I just finished the fourth book, which took all of Adam's charm and applied it to one of the most poignantly touching love stories I've ever read, and now I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I've experienced everything I wanted life to offer me through the eyes of Arthur Dent, and now that I'm back in my own skin in my own vastly different and significantly more boring life I'm feeling a sense of loss. This is coming as a bit of a surprise since I wasn't expecting to find this kind of substance from these books. I had always imagined that they were just some silly, slap-stick humor type sci-fi books.

Besides ranting about the meaning these books have to me and my own sadness that the man who created them is no longer with us, I also wanted to create this post to ask you guys two things:

1) Should I read Mostly Harmless? The general consensus I've gotten is that it takes the beauty of the fourth book and takes it in a depressing direction, and I'd really much rather end this journey on the note it's on right now (as has been recommended to me more than a few times). But at the same time I want so badly to read more HHGttG. So I'm feeling a bit torn. Also, what about the 6th book that eion colfer wrote?

2) Are there any other books out there that come anywhere close to the psychedelic wit, hilarity, and spirit that this series has? I've heard dirk gently recommended more than a few times, and I'm about 1 or 2 chapters into it right now but it hasn't captivated me in the same way that HHGttG did. I'm going to continue on with it anyway though since Adams was behind it.

So long, Douglas Adams... and thanks for all the fish. :'(

Edit: Wow, wasn't expecting this to explode like this. I think it's gunna take me the next few years to get through my inbox lol. 

I've got enough recommendations in this thread to keep me reading for a couple lifetimes lol - but Pratchett, Gaiman, and Vonnegut are definitely the most common ones, so I'll definitely be digging into that content. And there's about as many people vehemently stating that I shouldn't read mostly harmless as there are saying that I should. Still a bit unsure about it but I'm thinking I'll give it a bit of time to let the beauty of the first four books fade into my memory and then come back and check it out. 

Thanks for the reviews and recommendations everybody! ",normal

"My favorite quote about books from Ursula Le Guin: ""In reading a novel, any novel, we have to know perfectly well that the whole thing is nonsense, and then, while reading, believe every word of it..."" Here is the whole quote:


""In reading a novel, any novel, we have to know perfectly well that the whole thing is nonsense, and then, while reading, believe every word of it. Finally, when we're done with it, we may find - if it's a good novel - that we're a bit different from what we were before we read it, that we have been changed a little, as if by having met a new face, crossed a street we never crossed before. But it's very hard to say just what we learned, how we were changed."" - Ursula Le Guin


It is from an introduction she wrote for The Left Hand of Darkness which i just started reading, and this quote really resonated with me. I've been reading books since i could read, and my favorite ones are sci-fi. What she wrote is exactly how i feel about every book i read, i just could never put it into such beautiful words like she did.

"The Libby app changed my life I was a book worm child and young adult. I read constantly, everything and fast. If my parents wanted to punish me, they took my books away. I read in the car, under my school books, in the bathroom, under the covers, at parties. Books were such a central part of my life until I was in my 20s, when slowly but surely, I lost the ability to focus on anything but rereading a few favourites.

Maybe the combination of smartphones, social media and kids did it, but suddenly I'd rather do anything but read. I would read a couple things on vacation, and that was about it. I felt so guilty about it (and weird - to go from being an objectively well-read young adult to a mindless FB scrolling adult), but I just didn't have the stamina or interest to consume new books.

Finally, I downloaded the Libby app. It was my daughter that inspired me to get it set up, because I was getting concerned about her screen time and how much less she read than myself as a kid, but also because she's dyslexic and audiobooks are a much better media for her. So we both started using the app and IT. CHANGED. MY. LIFE.

I have already read 48 books since the new year. I have read non-fiction, new fiction, reread books I haven't thought of in years, classics that I ""read"" in university, all the books that I have heard about but somehow never got around to. Someone mentions a book to me, I can find it and borrow it right away. The library doesn't have a book, I can place a hold and it shows up automatically a few days later. I can even have two libraries (my current city library has a smaller English collection, so I added my hometown's library). I can suggest the library buy books! I can try a book I'd never have bothered to buy, and return it in an instant if I'm not interested. As an easily distracted, disorganized person who regularly racked up huge late fees, all the guilt and frustration associated with borrowing and returning books is gone.

Libby made it possible for me to deal with my internet addiction and stick to a social media diet. I can read in bed again without waking my spouse, or listen to audio books. It's even helped me go to the physical library more often, when I read a book on the app that I realize would be excellent in physical form. It sounds crazy, but I'm sleeping better, I'm happier, and overall just feeling like a real human being with a brain.

A lot of times with a really good book, I don't want it to end but at least I have a little something to put me in a more optimistic mood.

A dollar scratcher is nothing, but I at least occasionally win with the $5-$20 tickets. And it's a good way to... put a bookend on my reading experience.

"The Dresden Files is unreadable because of how women are described I got through 3 of the Dresden Files books before I had to put them down. The author just cannot keep from commenting on how sexy every single female character is and how chivalrous and misogynistic Harry is. 
An example from the book:
 ""She pushed back her asphalt-colored hair with one hand and gave me a look of pure calculation. Then she simply crossed her legs, so that the cut of her dress left one pale leg bare to midthigh. A subtle motion of her back thrust out her young, firm breasts, so that their tips pressed visibly against the fabric. ‚ÄúOf course, Mr. Dresden. I‚Äôm sure we can do business.‚Äù The look she gave me was direct, sensual, and willing."" 

Every single woman is portrayed exactly like this and I think it represents the worst in Urban Fantasy.

"When I replaced social media with reading A couple years ago I discovered my library has an ebook app I can download onto my phone.  So, as an experiment, I moved my Facebook app and put the ebook app in its place.  I normally used the Facebook app when doing things like waiting in the lunch line or at the bus stop or something.  I told myself that from there on out, I would read during those times instead of browsing social media.  The results were more telling than I expected.  Here's what I noticed:

1. I had been checking social media so often that it had become a muscle memory.  For the first few days, I would constantly reach into my pocket, pull out my phone, and open the app, all without realizing.  And then I would be startled to see a sea of words instead of Facebook.  Because I guess reading is something that calls for actual attention, which I wasn't prepared to give during those times.  But I had no idea how habitually I was checking Facebook until I was doing this.
2. I went to a presentation about criminal justice reform.  When it was getting wrapped up and conclusions were being said, I got bored, and was about to reach for my phone.  But then I thought: if I had a clunky book with me, would I pull it out and start reading it right then?  No, because that would be rude.  Cell phones seem like they're less rude because I COULD be doing something important, like answering an urgent text.  But is being rude OK as long as you're disguising it well?  Hmmm.... 
3. I found myself reading a lot more.  Finishing a lot more books.  Which is great!  Except, it means that I had previously been reading actual books worth of social media on a regular basis.  I find this disturbing to think about.
4. I came to like ebooks!  They're much easier for reading on-the-go, and since I'm using my library's app I can support the library without having to make the trip down there.

I hope I'm not coming off as some old guy who thinks that phones and social media are evil.  I still use social media regularly, including the apps, but this experiment shed some light on problematic habits I'd formed and how I can use this technology more wisely.  ",normal

Cell data comes and goes here so I'll be checking the thread here and there answering whenever I can. It's really nice to talk about this stuff though because I'm pretty much the only serious reader up here lol

A little background first: In early 2021 my life kind of fell apart very quickly. I lost my job, my long-term relationship of almost 10 years dissolved and I had a falling out with my dad, leading me to damn near a mental breakdown.

So I decided to make a clean break of it and do something I had always fantasized about - I left the big city and everything in my life behind and travelled up to northern British Columbia, Canada with nothing but a backpack, some clothes and an e-reader. Found work at a remote wilderness lodge just doing maintenance and odd jobs. The plan was to disconnect myself from everything and be somewhere in nature with barely any internet and cell service.

I really just wanted to isolate myself, lose myself in some good books, and recalibrate my mental state after all the shit that went down. The last 12-13 months have basically just been work, read and hike/camp among the beautiful northern landscapes the lodge was located in.

I managed to read close to 40 books in that timeframe, and I wanted to share my thoughts on them with the sub as reading, more than anything, helped me center myself and get some perspective on my life. I read across a variety of genres and have ranked them with a little mini-review below, from worst to best. I didn't do an overall ranking, but rather ranked the books I read within their specific genres/categories.

**Classics/Literary Fiction:**

8. A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara: Honestly, this book kind of irritated me in how transparent it was at being shamelessly emotionally manipulative. It was certainly very well-written, but I found Jude just unbelievably stupid as a character and after a certain point in the story, found myself losing any kind of empathy towards him. The rest of the characters are fairly non-descript. The book is kind of morbidly fun to see just how over the top the misery porn can get though, but I hesitate to actually call it ‚Äúgood‚Äù

7. A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway: I‚Äôm starting to think that Hemingway might just not be for me. I‚Äôve read The Old Man and the Sea and The Sun Also Rises previously, and found them ‚Äújust okay‚Äù. That was my prevailing sentiment towards AFtA as well. I do like Hemingway‚Äôs terse, succinct style, but in this one, I felt it actually kind of worked against him because it makes both the war setting and central relationship feel a bit flat. But the worse thing about the book is the character of Catherine. Jesus christ, she is annoying. Just an insipid, silly character. I did like the downbeat, depressing ending though

6. A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens: I have to admit, I was ready to hate this book throughout the first couple hundred pages. It‚Äôs dense, slow and filled with a shit ton of what fills like unimportant minutiae. But it eventually comes together, and the slow buildup really manages to create an epic scope and magnitude that are unlike anything else I‚Äôve read from old Charles. It‚Äôs a story that demands concentration and attention, and by the final, powerful third act, it‚Äôs well worth it.

5. East of Eden by John Steinbeck: An epic, multi-generational family saga, East of Eden is a work that for me works masterfully on both an epic and an personal scale. It‚Äôs hard to encompass everything this story does so well in a short review. It‚Äôs both a biblical, mythical retelling as well as an intimate character study punctuated with some best-in-class writing. It makes the Salinas Valley into a living, breathing entity of its own, with these macro and micro tales of good and evil spanning its expanse. Also, fuck Cathy Ames. All my homies hate Cathy Ames

4. To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf: This is my first encounter with Woolf, and it solidified for me that I will be coming back to her body of work multiple times. It was definitely a bit of a struggle getting into it, as you‚Äôre jusyt thrown into the deep end with Woolf‚Äôs abstract prose and stream of consciousness style. But once you grab hold of what Woolf is trying to do, it becomes a beautifully melancholic story with a pastoral feel that nonetheless manages to really capture a huge gamut of human emotions and perspectives

3. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy: Horrifically beautiful. It‚Äôs fairly challenging to start, but once you start vibing with McCarthy‚Äôs style and writing, the narrative just completely immerses you into it. It‚Äôs like a surreal, fever-dream, gruesomely violent vision of the Wild West with gorgeous depictions of the landscape, brilliantly written dialogue and prose that begs to be read over and over, and the most unforgettable villain I‚Äôve come across in literature. This is a novel I can see myself going back to time and time again

2. The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky: I was flip-flopping between this one and Middlemarch as the #1 book in the classics/literature category but it‚Äôs very close. This book is, on the surface, ‚Äújust‚Äù a murder-mystery but in actuality is a dense, complex philosophical exploration of various facets of life. This is a masterpiece of character development as we see ideas of free will, morality and family told through multiple different lenses. It‚Äôs also a bit of a treatise on religion and the meaning of faith. In short, it‚Äôs a *lot* and there‚Äôs probably a ton that I didn‚Äôt even get in one read-through. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs an epic tale that I found both illuminating and entertaining

1. Middlemarch by George Eliot: A wonderful, atmospheric slow burn, and might be one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read. Honestly probably in my top 5 of all time. I found it to be such an all-encompassing look at the things that make us human, and feels both incredibly personal and universal at the same time (kind of like East of Eden). It‚Äôs a story about marriage (hit me particularly close to hom) and about sacrifice, with masterfully sketched characters and an exploration of life in era to the minutest details. ‚ÄúImmersive‚Äù is a word that gets thrown around a lot for books but that‚Äôs what Middlemarch truly is ‚Äì a totally lived in feeling of a small, nowhere English town a couple of hundred years ago. I found it unforgettable

**Historical Fiction:**

5. Shogun by James Clavell: This is a huge, huge novel, both in its page count, as well as the scope of the story and the characters. Historically speaking, it did seem a little mythologized and perhaps overly romanticizing of the whole samurai/warrior culture, and the main protagonist is a bit of a bland nothing white male fantasy. Clavell‚Äôs prose is also merely workmanlike. But as an entertaining story, it fares much better, and is actually very well-paced for something that‚Äôs almost 1200 pages.

4. Hawaii by James Michener: This is my first book written by Michener, and I can see why he came to be seen as the godfather of historical fiction. This, like Shogun, is an absolute unit of a book, and although it‚Äôs plenty flawed, I came away from it with something close to awe just based on the sheer scope of the timeframe that Michener captures here. the formation of Hawaii in the first chapter is some of the best storytelling I read in the past year. However, this is a book that gets progressively less interesting as it goes and moves into the ‚Äúpresent‚Äù time, and the characters are little more than pawns. Still recommended though especially if you find Hawaii interesting

3. Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel: Once I figured out that everytime this book uses ‚Äúhe‚Äù (which is a LOT), it‚Äôs almost always referring to the main character Thomas Cromwell, I started to enjoy it a lot more. It‚Äôs really eloquently written and Cromwell is a brilliantly developed character. It‚Äôs a story that requires a lot of focus but to me it eventually paid off, and the narrative really carries you along once you get used to Mantel‚Äôs idiosyncrasies.

2. I, Claudius by Robert Graves: well-written, funny and hugely informative. Really a slow burn character study of the eponymous Claudius, and the compulsively entertaining look at the back-door dealings and family conflicts of that era in Rome. I thought it also did a pretty great job at exploring the thirst of power and the excesses certain people are willing to go to achieve it. Just a great, multifaceted read overall.

1. Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry: This book is seriously a contender for one of my top 10 favourites of all time. To begin with, the two main protagonists are just incredibly written and developed, and the attachment you have towards them carries you through to the monumental length of the narrative. It‚Äôs an emotionally powerful story with an excellent main plot and smaller side stories that are all great in their own right. Just a truly epic tale told by a master storyteller

**Science Fiction:**

6. Ready Player One by Ernest Cline: I imagine I would have probably liked this book if I was still in high school, crammed as it is full of video game power fantasies and endless pop culture references. But good god, actually reading it as an adult was a painful experience. Other than being a compendium of 80s homages, it fails spectacularly on almost every level. Bad writing, bad characters, tedious, dull storytelling. It‚Äôs frankly just awful

5. Foundation by Isaac Asimov: Look, I know this is a foundational (hehe) ‚Äúcanon‚Äù text in the sf genre, but I just found it to have too many issues to truly enjoy. The concepts and ideas are great ‚Äì eye-opening and fascinating ‚Äì but for me, the book fell flat in almost every other area. The characters are little more than cardboard cutouts, the writing style is about as wooden as it gets, and the book is very much of its time (i.e. dated af) when it comes to women. Really, this is just a collection of scenes with characters sitting in rooms and talking. Dynamic storytelling it is not, despite the interesting concepts

4. Dune by Frank Herbert: I don‚Äôt know if this will be unpopular or not, but I honestly thought Dune was just‚Ä¶ok. I watched and loved the movie, and decided to jump into the book afterwards. While I do appreciate the worldbuilding that went into it ‚Äì as well as the often weird, surreal 60s drugged-out atmosphere ‚Äì as a piece of storytelling I feel like Dune has been improved upon over the years. I still respected it as a forerunner of so many different kinds of sff stories we have these days, but taken on its own merits I found it to be interesting but rather turgid on the whole

3. Red Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson: I can‚Äôt imagine a more definitive fictional story about Mars than this one. The amount of thoughtful research and extrapolation of science, technology, politics and society that has gone into this novel is simply phenomenal. It honest to god at times reads like an instruction manual for the first Mars colonists, whenever we end up getting there. That does work to the novel‚Äôs detriment at times though, as it can feel a bit dry and overly technical at parts. But I still found it to be a grand, immersive read, and the somewhat boring parts were more than compensated for by the overall sweep of the story and the author‚Äôs incredible vision of a Martian future for humanity

2. The Dispossessed by Ursula K Le Guin: Complex, thoughtful and human. This isn‚Äôt the first Le Guin book that will appear on this list either. This book is the best depiction of a realistic utopia I‚Äôve ever seen in fiction, and it does what the best sf does and presents a fascinating ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù look at a cool concept. Unlike a lot of sf, it succeeds hugely in two other areas. The first is creating a fully-realized central character ‚Äì Shevek is an awesome protagonist with a lot of depth and nuance. The second is Le Guin‚Äôs inimitable prose, which is elegant and beautiful while still somehow managing to be simple and concise

1.Hyperion by Dan Simmons: This might be the best sf novel I‚Äôve ever read. It‚Äôs the rare sf story (imo) that is both excellent from both a literary and ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù perspective. It‚Äôs just crammed full of cool ideas and concepts, and I loved the Canterbury Tales-esque structure, which leads to the book‚Äôs greatest asset ‚Äì the characters. I found each ‚Äúpilgrim‚Äù to be fascinating and well-developed, and their respective stories were beautifully told, ranging from thrilling, scary, funny to downright haunting and tragic. The Priest‚Äôs Tale and the Scholar‚Äôs Tale have both been etched in my mind since I read them. This book is an incredible achievement and to me a high-water mark for the speculative fiction genre

**Horror:**

5. The Troop by Nick Cutter: Not much to say about this one. It‚Äôs a pulpy, B-movie-esque story without much in the way of characterization, prose or depth. But it does disgusting body horror better than almost any other horror novel I‚Äôve ever read. Some of the scenes are downright grotesque and repulsive, and I have a high tolerance for that kind of stuff. It‚Äôs a quick, easy read and but not particularly memorable outside of the gross-out factor

4. The Elementals by Michael McDowell: A fun, atmospheric and really well written Southern Gothic horror story. This book is akin to Haunting of Hill House in that it deals in subtlety and a sense of creeping doom. It‚Äôs a definitely slow burn but that really helps it in building a stifling sense of gloom and dread. The characters are fascinating and it really is very well-written. Highly recommended if you like horror novels focused more on atmosphere than gore/jump scares

3. The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories/The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories by HP Lovecraft: I‚Äôm combining these two collections into one as they‚Äôre essentially just one big compendium. After reading these, I‚Äôve become a huge Lovecraft fan. I‚Äôm aware of his racism and xenophobia but I believe in separating the art from the artist to a certain degree. Anyway, I thought these stories were mostly pretty awesome. I actually love Lovecraft‚Äôs verbose, overwrought prose ‚Äì it really gives the stories a certain level of operatic, melodramatic ambiance. Some of the Dunsany-inspired stories are downright gorgeous. The mythos is fascinating and in the best stories ‚Äì At the Mountains of Madness, The Shadow over Innsmouth, The Colour out of Space etc. ‚Äì he reaches a kind of dark, horrific grandeur. Reading these in the remote northern landscape was truly a fantastic experience

2. The Books of Blood by Clive Barker: Dark, horrific, visceral, erotic ‚Äì this is an incredible collection of horror short stories. Barker is a hell of a writer ‚Äì a few levels above most in this genre, and he has a uniquely twisted and dark imagination obsessed with the human body, and in particular, sexuality, and how the body can be a battleground of all sorts of horrors, physical or otherwise. Some of them also have a dreamlike, surreal feel to them. In particular, I was blown away by ‚ÄúIn the Hills, the Cities‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs a story unlike any I‚Äôve ever read before, mind-boggling, bizarre and haunting. Also of note are ‚ÄúThe Midnight Meat Train‚Äù, ‚ÄúRawhide Rex‚Äù and ‚ÄúDread‚Äù, but honestly they are all pretty damn great even at their weakest

1.The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson: The amazing show led me to the book, and although the source material is almost completely different other than sharing some names with the characters from the show, it‚Äôs an incredible story in its own right. Jackson‚Äôs prose is probably the best I‚Äôve come across in this genre, and her ability to create atmosphere and mood is without peer. The setting just feels alive in all its creepy, gothic glory. It‚Äôs a fairly small, intimate story but a very powerful, often gut-wrenching one in how it captures the main character‚Äôs very human flaws and insecurities. In the end, it leaves us pondering about what‚Äôs more terrifying ‚Äì a seemingly haunted house full of ghosts or the doubts and self-loathing in our own hearts?

**Non-Fiction:**

5. Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari: Yeah‚Ä¶I wasn‚Äôt really feeling this one. I understand why it‚Äôs popular and it did start off very well. But the vast majority of the book is just too full of speculation and the author‚Äôs own musings without much in the way of concrete evidence. I also found his mythologizing of hunting and gathering and seeming dislike of the agricultural revolution strange and misguided. The whole book just felt a mile wide and inch deep. Superficial, surface-level exploration without any true insight or in-depth analysis of a complex topic

4. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can‚Äôt Stop Talking by Susan Cain: Wow, if ever there was a non-fiction book tailor-made for Reddit, this is it lol. I have to admit, this book did come to me at the perfect time, as I was in a pretty closed-off, solitary mood after making my big move. I liked it well enough, and the insight into analyzing introvert behaviour was fairly interesting. But honestly, for the most part, this book just felt like it was preaching to the choir, about how awesome and helpful introversion is. It tends to conflate a lot of psychological aspects and concepts with a generalized sweep without really delving deep into them. Ultimately, it really feels like a narrative that‚Äôs just self-affirmation for introverts. Which I guess is not all bad

3. The Ancestor‚Äôs Tale by Richard Dawkins: I‚Äôve always been a huge fan of Dawkins and evolutionary science in general, and this book to me, is his masterwork. It‚Äôs painstakingly detailed look at 4 billion years of evolution through certain ancestors that‚Äôs structured like the Canterbury Tales. It‚Äôs a little different from Dawkins‚Äô other books in that it‚Äôs a bit more technical and maybe not as friendly to the layperson ‚Äì and also missing his trademark snark and cynicism (whether that‚Äôs a good thing is up to the read). But it‚Äôs incredibly enlightening and informative, and even eye-opening.

2. The First Three Minutes by Steven Weinberg: If you have any interest in astronomy and cosmology at all, then this book is a must-read. It‚Äôs fairly old, written near the end of the 70s, but aside from missing the discovery of dark matter, it‚Äôs still very much relevant and probably the best encapsulation of the big bang and the beginning of our universe you can find. It straddles the line perfectly between being appropriate for a casual reader and someone more academic

1. Endurance by Alfred Lansing: Boy did I pick the perfect book to read while living in a cold, remote landscape. Endurance is without a doubt one of the most thrilling, intense stories of survival I‚Äôve ever read. You come away with awe and respect at not only the courage, determination and perseverance of these men, but also at the sheer unfeeling power of nature itself. Some of the events and twists are so crazy that it feels like the contrivances of a Hollywood director ‚Äì in the best way possible. Lansing captures everything with some truly mind-boggling amount of research from primary sources, and creates an incredibly entertaining ‚Äì and scary - narrative

**Fantasy:**

6. The Shadow Rising by Robert Jordan: This was the only DNF book for me out of my entire list. I had read Eye of the World and The Great Hunt before, and I did a quick summary read-through of those two books to catch me up on the third book. I remember finding the first two books flawed even when reading them as a teenager but tried to give the series another shot. It‚Äôs a no go, to be honest. I just can‚Äôt over how weirdly juvenile and archaic all the characters and their interactions are. It borders on being cringeworthy and Jordan‚Äôs understanding and writing of female characters is just baffling. The plot just seems like more of the same. Bad guy of the week needs to be stopped by motley crew of magically powered teenagers. I‚Äôm calling it quits on Wheel of Time for good

5. Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson: I read the first book of Stormlight a few years back and thought it was alright. Have seen rave reviews of WoR and decided to give it a shot and honestly came away really underwhelmed. There are some cool ideas for worldbuilding here but I don‚Äôt really find Sanderson to be a good writer at all. Aside from the wooden prose, the characters just come off as shallow, fantasy archetypes and the plot is both convoluted and nonsensical at the same time. Too much time is spent on explaining how powers and magic works ‚Äì which I also found to be an issue with the first book. I can see the appeal of these books for younger readers as they basically are like spectacle-filled action movies, but they are not for me

4. Red Rising/Golden Sun by Pierce Brown: I read these back to back because they‚Äôre fairly quick, easy reads. These are essentially mindless action movies in book form and they were a pretty nice change of pace as I needed something lighter after Wolf Hall. The character is a total Gary Stu, the dialogue is ridiculous and the story is crazy over the top. But yeah, it‚Äôs pretty fun, can‚Äôt deny that

3. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susannah Clarke: Man, this book might have taken me the longest out of everything I read in the past year, and there were times when I was contemplating dropping it. I‚Äôm glad I persevered though because I eventually came to love it. It‚Äôs essentially a Victorian novel, written in that era‚Äôs style with almost scary accuracy, and a fantasy novel-of-manners. Once you get on its wavelength, you start to appreciate the writing and the beautifully immersive world with some fascinating characters. The footnotes are amazing and the slow burn really helps create a wonderful atmosphere that carries you through to the end

2. A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K Le Guin: Man, Le Guin is on her way to becoming one of my favourite authors. This little book is beautiful and punches far above its weight in terms of ratio of size to content. It‚Äôs a small little thing, especially compared to a lot of the bloated doorstoppers common to the genre but for me, it contained more emotion and wisdom than 10 Jordans or Sandersons. Written in Le Guin‚Äôs clear yet elegant prose, it has a fairy-tale-esque melancholy atmosphere, as if it‚Äôs a story you‚Äôre being told in front of a fireplace by your grandfather or something. It‚Äôs a story of self-discovery and learning to accept the dark parts of yourself, all brilliantly written. Will be continuing with the rest of the series eventually

1. The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe: Preface ‚Äì I only read Shadow and Claw so far but holy shit. What a book. Mysterious, mystical, weird, beautiful and often frustrating ‚Äì BotNS is unlike any fantasy I‚Äôve ever read. It probably has the most gorgeous prose I‚Äôve ever come across in the genre, and the usage of allegory and metaphor was really well done. The strange, dreamlike, almost surreal ambiance is what really stood out to me, and despite the obfuscations of the plot and the language, this still makes the book easy to get lost in

That‚Äôs it for my reviews/analysis! Let me know what you guys think of these books. I‚Äôm in the process of going through another batch of stories and may post another review thread in a year or so lol",normal
"Have you ever read a book nonstop from the moment you woke up to the moment you went to bed? If so, what book was it? For me, I think I've done this a good amount of times. I've done it for the Stormlight Archive books when I was near the end and I felt like I could marathon the rest of it. I also did it for the last Wheel of Time book during the infamously long chapter (if you've read the book you'll know what I'm talking about). 

Has a book ever captured your attention so well you literally couldn't put it down all day?

Edit: So, the reason I made this post was because I just spent the entire day reading Brandon Sanderson‚Äôs The Hero of Ages, which is the third book in his Mistborn era 1 series. I started at around 7 am and finished the book literally 20 minutes ago, only stopping to write this post. I thought I was crazy for reading non stop for so long but seeing all these responses just makes me smile knowing that I‚Äôm not alone in my insane reading habits.

"I am translating somewhat unknown Soviet literature and want to know what people think. I‚Äôm a translator from the United States who has been living in Russia for the past several years. I‚Äôve launched a project called [Soviet Literature in English](https://sovietlit.wordpress.com/) in which I plan to bring popular literature from the Soviet period to English-speaking readers who might be interested in learning more about what people read behind the Iron Curtain.

I hope to bring these texts to a readable, modern English while also attempting to explain certain cultural aspects that may appear.

I am beginning my project with children‚Äôs literature. I have already posted a translation of the story *Dubravka* (1957) by Radiy Pogodin, and am currently working on the translation of Arkady Gaidar‚Äôs 1938 novella *The Fate of a Drummer Boy*.

"After not having read in over 15 years, I set a goal to read one book a month in 2019. My love for reading quickly rekindled, it became one book a week. I just finished book 52 this year. Here are my favorites: **The Girl With Seven Names** by Hyeonseo Lee

I can‚Äôt help but add the very first book that started the frenzy off. The story of a young girl who defected from North Korea was so riveting, I finished it in three days. She had a TED talk as well for those who are interested. 


**The Book Thief** by Markus Zusak

The WW2 era always fascinated me, and the story of a young girl in Nazi Germany shows a side to the war us Americans rarely see. Tragedy, love, and a passion for reading kept me entangled for too many late nights on this one.


**The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers

I really should include all three of her ‚ÄúWayfarer‚Äù series in this, as well as her latest fourth book. This was a Reddit Book Club section that I enjoyed SO much, I immediately bought the remaining two: ‚ÄúA Closed and Common Orbit‚Äù and ‚ÄúRecord of a Spaceborn Few‚Äù. Chambers has a way of writing such believable science fiction without sounding dull or over the top. I wish she had more novels out.


**A Thousand Splendid Suns** and **Kite Runner** by Khaled Hosseini 

Both of Hosseini‚Äôs books take place in the tumultuous Middle East during times of peace and then times of conflict. The contrast between both time frames and how it affected the characters pulled some big ugly tears from me a few times. He writes with such depth I found myself ordering ‚ÄúAnd The Mountains Echoed‚Äù to read next.


**Where the Crawdads Sing** by Delia Owens

Don‚Äôt judge a book by its cover and don‚Äôt assume a ‚Äúswamp rat‚Äù is just that. I was recommended this one and I‚Äôve learned to listen to my friends; they clearly know what I will enjoy. Every recommendation I chose to read I was thoroughly entertained. 


**Born a Crime** by Trevor Noah

If you think Trevor Noah is funny in his stand-up comedy, you will laugh at his childhood memoir about growing up in South Africa. Definitely had me chuckling out loud.


**The Goldfinch** by Donna Tartt

I did not expect this to be such a long book. When it showed up at my door I wondered what I got myself into. The first few chapters I still thought I was crazy. But I have a rule: get halfway through at least before you give up. I maybe got a half dozen chapters in before I knew I‚Äôd never give it up. I‚Äôve been told the movie was less than entertaining however so I probably will skip it. 


**The Huntress** by Kate Quinn

Another one recommended by a friend and sure enough I stayed awake far too late some nights because I couldn‚Äôt put this down. Told from the point of view of each of the main characters, the intertwining as it progresses is a style I‚Äôve found I enjoy very much. I‚Äôm told Quinn‚Äôs other book ‚ÄúThe Alice Network‚Äù is also one I need to read.


**Entire Harry Potter Series** by JK Rowling

I spent well over a decade refusing to read Harry Potter or watch any of the movies. I resisted purely because it was so trendy. I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúrebel‚Äù or anything, I just didn‚Äôt want to get caught up in SUCH a strong craze. Well now I know WHY it was so immensely popular. Oh and yes, now I have seen the movies as well :)


EDIT: thank you so much for the support and for the shiny metal! This sub has been so informative and I‚Äôm so grateful for all the books it has led me to read. You all rock!

EDIT 2: lots of people have asked

1) How could I go so long without reading?! After high school life just got in the way and my time management was poor back then. I wish I had books as a refuge for some dark times though, and I hope anyone trying to get back into reading is successful.

2) How do I stay so focused or read so quickly? I used to wander off in thought a lot and it got worse and my list of worries grew as an adult. Now, I sit with the audio version as well as the physical book and it keeps me focused. 

3) Do I buy brand new books, used, library etc? I love the feel of real books. But this can be more expensive than an electronic reader for sure. Thrift stores, garage sales, used book sales, and Amazon have been my saving grace. I found my entire hard cover Harry Potter set at a thrift store in fact. Took a few trips to get it all but at $3 a book it was worth it.

PLEASE keep the recommendations coming!! Of all the books I chose to read this year maybe five were of my own choosing. Most were from Reddit, friends, family, and various articles online. You people have opened my eyes to some incredible books!",normal
"I‚Äôve finished The Name of the Wind and I am blown away The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss is the single best book I‚Äôve read in a long, long time. If there was ever a book that held me so captivated for so long before, I certainly don‚Äôt remember. Rothfuss certainly has a way with words especially when establishing atmosphere and ambiance. His world is rife with character and depth and is as lively as our own, as well as adorably tongue-in-cheek at times. Each character I feel like I know on a personal level. I had legitimate difficulty putting this book down and that has not happened in at least ten years. 

One of my favorite things about this series is that there‚Äôs a sort of science to the magic the characters create, which called sympathy. This lets you more or less deduce how things take effect and sort of tally what‚Äôs happening magically, something I don‚Äôt think a lot of fantasy books have, in my experience. Rothfuss meshes magic with actual established science and reason making it just that much more believable.

Truth be told I‚Äôm nearly halfway through Wise Man‚Äôs Fear, the second book, and it‚Äôs just as great for further establishing the world at large. I anxiously await the third book, however I‚Äôm not really in any rush. Rothfuss should take all the time he needs to make everything just right. thankfully I have the rest of book two to tide me over until then. There‚Äôs an accompanying book to go with them that I will undoubtedly read as well because I can‚Äôt get enough! I cannot speak enough praise of the Name of the Wind.

EDIT: Hi, Front Page! Holy shit this exploded! i'll get to comments as i am able, but i'm not sure. i might have to fake my own death or something. maybe open an inn in some backwater town...

So, lay the fuck off him and  let the man write in peace! This is why I say that he can take all the time he needs. How fucking hard is it to wait for something anyhow?!

"I have started reading to my wife and it is an awesome feeling Hi everyone,

Sometime last month I saw a post from this subreddit on the popular screen talking about how they only watched the Lord of the Rings movies and how the books vastly expanded the story. So I thought, why not, I love fantasy books and decided I would start from the beginning of the series when I could. Jump to last week, my wife and I head to B&N and pick up a few books. I headed straight to the sci-fi and fantasy section as usual and found the LOTR section. I picked up a copy of the Silmarillion among a few other books and headed out (obviously stopping by the board game selection before leaving).

Jump to 3 nights ago, I was sitting in bed reading and my wife was saying she was having a really tough time going to sleep and I said I could read to her. As a note, my wife doesn't prefer the time dedicated to world building that I enjoy, which is basically all of the Silmarillion for as far as I've gotten.

"The Art of Not Giving a F*ck was exhausting In the beginning I thought it was cool, made me giggle a bit. But then it became more and more of someone desperately trying to show how their opinions are the right opinions. Trying to show how cool, unoffended, not-like-the-other-girls they are. I found myself wanting to ask if the author was okay. 

It reminds me of talking to someone who hasn't had anyone to talk to in ages. At first you're like, ""a little weird but it's cute,"" then suddenly they just start bombarding you with every random thought and their opinions about everything. Going on and on and on trying to show how much better and special than others they, and their ""unique"" opinions, are. I found myself with pity...and exhaustion. 

Idk why he was so pressed about everything and gave so much fuck to the point of ruining a book by the need to insert his opinions about even things he sounds so clueless about. I really tried but I couldn't find enough fucks to finish it (or should I say, put up with it') despite being so close!

"I'm so tired of authors describing skin like mine with chocolate or mocha. How would you like it if every time a character who looks like you is introduced they get compared to mayonnaise? If I see one more chocolate, mocha, caramel in a character description I'm going to scream. Like at this point if you're doing it it has to be on purpose. It annoys me because we'll get character descriptions like:

""The detective was a portly fellow. His face was marked with pot marks that betrayed his age that his jet black toupee was trying to hide. He rubbed the stubble on his face as he looked over the cold case."" 

""As I scanned the classroom I saw numerous kids at various levels of interest. Jen was one of the kids who was at level zero. Head down and covered by her brunette hair. Her skinny frame looked as if it was getting swallowed by the oversized desk. I went to wake her up.""

""Jackson was a man that took care of his body. He worked out twice a day. He had clear smooth skin that a blemish wouldn't dare to sabotage. His only flaw was that he was balding. After growing out his beard he made the big decision to cut all of the hair on his head off. ""

Which are cool they give you a quick sense of the character and let you easily formulate a mental picture of the character. And then we'll get descriptions like:

""Ebony was a mocha chocolate queen. Her caramel and cream complexion would have stopped any person in their tracks. Her gold hoop earrings swayed like her hips as she walked towards me."" 

Like BRUHHHHHH. 



All these examples above don't mention race. They could technically be anyone. But it's like they are explicitly saying when someone is black, in a clich√© way at that. And when someone is white they don't ever explicitly say. It's just assumed white is the default and everything has to be explained or addressed. 

Sorry for the vent. It's just dehumanizing, and fetishizing. I get it you've read one book they described a white person as having milky skin. It's not the same.

If you want better ways to describe skin tone check out this helpful link! I would be fine with literally any description that doesn't have a historical connotation of dehumanizing and fetishizing black people.

This chocolate thing isn't something I'm making up. It's a relatively common complaint into black spaces. 

**The book ""The Delectable Negro: Human Consumption and Homoeroticism within U.S. Slave Culture"" also touches on this! If you're not understanding the history, context or just not getting how calling a black person chocolate and a white person milk are different and how it's definitely fetishizing, dehumanizing and sexual, read this book!**

Edit: there's seems to be this assumption that I'm young and some kinda Twitter/tumblr sjw who is only looking to be outraged and this isn't isn't a real thing that happens and if it is it's not that bad. And if it's that bad there's more important things we can be talking about. 

Also there's a sweeping assumption that I'm a woman because my comments were seen as emotional and frustrated and because no man cares about you this shit. 

I'm a dude. I'm black. It's just a topic I care about. Calling black people chocolate is fetishizing and has so much historical context behind it it's jarring. It's also clich√©. So much so it's a old topic. I seriously didn't think I'd have to prove this common thing exists.

Yes white people sometimes get described as milky, alabaster or the other terms in comments. No it's not the same thing as describing black people as chocolate. It's dehumanizing and fetishizing.

Ask any black woman who is on dating apps how many times she's called chocolate by white men and then ask her if she likes it.


**TLDR: if you're going to describe skin color, describe everyone's skin color not just anyone not white. If you're describing black people don't use chocolate or mocha etc because they are fetishizing and dehumanizing. Have empathy, just bec you personally don't care about this subject doesn't mean it's not important.**

"I fulfilled my ambition of reading IT. Due to my autism I have never been able to read novels and was told I never would, it just never worked for me. All I see is a jumble of words that don't seem to go anywhere in my mind. I also have no internal reading voice (well I do but it's just flat and monotone and has no emotional connection to words at all missing all the range and cadence needed to read) and on top of that my mind doesn't form any images unless I have already seen what Im trying to imagine. As you can see these factors make it almost impossible to read fiction novels. 

Well it took me a lot of hard work and a lot of time and concentration but I did it! I finally fulfilled my ambition of reading Stephen King's IT.

This ambition all started in the 90s when the IT miniseries first came out, I instantly fell in love with the whole thing from the characters to the place of Derry, Maine. I watched it so much that I knew it inside out, but I always knew by word of mouth that the book was a million times better.

Ive tried on and off to read this book but have always failed at pretty much page 1. Well after the new movies came out I was adamant I was gonna read this thing even if it killed me. 

I thought about my problems for a long time and finally came up with solutions to get past them... Basically I used the audiobook read by Steven Weber to replace my inner voice, I invested in the first edition to read along with (thoughts being that if I invested money it would be further incentive) and I sat in a dark room to block out all stimulus other than the words (using a reading lamp aimed only at the book). 

So I started the audio book and read along with the voice and it worked, it started going in! His voice sort of became my own and because I'd seen the miniseries and movies I didn't have any issues knowing what things and people looked like.

Well it took me since December but I finally reached the end and **OMG** what an amazing journey. Its probably been one of the greatest feelings and experiences in my life! I really can't get across enough how much I loved it. I struggle very much with emotions but this experience made me feel what I assume people refer to as emotion. The book is so so **SO** much better than any movie. I loved it so much that I am in the process of reading it again üòä

I just wanted to share this hoping it might inspire someone else to not give up on reading, it can enrich your life so much if you invest the time and effort. I also just wanted to share because I'm just so proud of myself.

Sorry this has been so long (and probably hard to make sense of, not great at writing either), but thank you for taking the time to read it.

"Pretty sure Stephanie Meyer is wrote a new novel that's slightly anti-religious under another name to avoid getting in trouble with the Mormon church. Stephanie Meyer is LDS (Mormon) and wrote the wildly popular Twilight and Host series. 

I just read a book called Corrine and it's a good romance about a girl who leaves a fundamentalist Christian church and has very Mormon vibes. I live in Utah, I grew up here, so I know all their favorite things (like naming their sons Enoch, the main character's name). 

The writing seemed very similar to Twilight as I was reading it, and I checked the back for the author and it says ""Rebecca Morrow is a pseudonym for a New York Times Best Selling author"".

Is it possible she is writing a book that would cause her to be excommunicated from her church and didn't want anyone to know? 

Let me know if anyone else has read it and what you think. I think it's a fun conspiracy, but I honestly think it's true!

Edit* In case anyone cares, further clues are as follows: 

It has a review from Jodi Picoult on the back. Why would she review a book from some nobody?

The cover marketing and book quality reeks of money. Big ole hardback book too.

I've read the Twilight series over 20 times and immediately recognized the writing. And then I looked at the back cover and found it was written under an anonymous bestselling author.

She mentions the leading male's hair color A LOT. Anyone remember Edward's copper head of hair mentioned a hundred times? Because I do.

Corrine is known as a specifically non-Mormon town established in Utah.

Update: I didn't expect this post to blow up, and I promise I wasn't trying to oust Stephanie Meyer and get her in trouble. I bet she was just trying to avoid awkward conversations in her ward, and she'll be totally fine.",normal

"I think refusing to name your ghostwriters is immoral I'm thinking of three authors right now:

* Danielle Steele, 179 books in about 49 years, who [claims she regularly writes 22 hours a day](https://www.glamour.com/story/danielle-steel-books-interview). I'm gonna go out on a limb and call bullshit.
* R.L. Stine, over 300 books in 30 years
* R.A. Salvatore, 103 books in 34 years
* *numbers are probably slightly off*

I think these authors should list their ghostwriter's as co-authors for the following reasons:

* They didn't write the book alone. If a ghostwriter substantially contributed to a book, they deserve to be recognized for doing so.
* The author's sole claim to having written the book is false, a lie.
* As a reader, If I like a book, I want to read the other books the ghostwriter wrote.
* The quiet use of ghostwriters creates an unrealistic expectation in new writer's minds that successful writers can crank out 4 or more books a year. I mean, it's possible, but you will wear yourself out.

That's my opinion. What's yours?

**UPDATE**

I can't prove any of these people use ghostwriters. Maybe they don't. I think they do. I think we can agree that there are *some* brands that use ghostwriters to crank out regular pieces of fiction. I actually *love* that this happens, but I still think the true writers should be on the cover.

Even if the ghostwriter is okay with their arrangement (and I think it is exploitative and should be regulated), they are still just agreeing to work with the author and the publisher to deceive the consumer. This should not be allowed under current law.",normal

"So my date took me to a bookstore yesterday... I hope this isn't off topic for this subreddit but I wanted to share a book related adventure I went on yesterday afternoon. This guy I really like asked me out for coffee and then took me to Barnes & Noble. Before we went in he gave me instructions:

""You need to pick out the best book you've never read.""

So we went in and after some very careful deliberation I picked out *When the Killing's Done* by T. C. Boyle and he ended up with *The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers* by Richard McGregor. Once we revealed our selections he looked me in the eye and said ""Now switch!""

So now I have to read about China's Communist leaders and he has to read T. C. Boyle. I wanted to share this because I thought it was a clever idea for a first date between book lovers and an unusual way of getting to know someone based on their taste in books. 

Has anyone else done something like this? If so, how did it turn out?

I didn't like Potter movies at first because I always watched them after reading the books. Its been a while I read those books and now I really like those movies. You get my point?

I didn't even like the lotr movies at first and now I love them. 
Right now I'm on a Michael chrichton binge and watched Congo and sphere after reading the books and I hated every minute of it. I also thought Jurassic Park paled in comparison to the books and that's one of my favorite movies of all time.

I think it's something to do with human psychology. Even the slightest difference from books to movies makes me mad. Even if that change is for the better.
At least give it a few months before u watch the movie after finishing the book. 

End of rant.

Edit: I agree that there are plenty of movies as good as or better than the books, but my point is that it's not a good idea to watch them soon after reading the book. I think Jurassic Park and fight club are better than the books but when you see them after just finishing the books it always dissappointed me.

"I'm a newbie to epic Sci-Fi literature, and reading DUNE has been an exhausting experience. Ok. I know that this post is going to be downvoted to hell, although I never understood why people downvote a post that has a different opinion to theirs, but I will say it anyways.. Reading DUNE did not turn out the way I thought it would.
 
I liked science fiction ideas in general ever since I was a kid. It was mostly due to the influence of films and thriller novels with light sci-fi plot lines with the exception of Andy Weir's *The Martian* which I loved. But I wanted to pick up some classic sci-fi works for quite some time.

So, this year, I decided to give DUNE a go as I wanted to read this novel before watching the movie that was supposed to come out this December. I started the novel in August. 

It was going fine until the first couple of hundred pages, but soon the reading experience turned into a tough one. The world building was too complex, and the descriptions seemed to be too much.. of things, traditions, cultures, and whatnot. Additionally, I was having trouble creating the mental images of a lot of things.. example: all the equipment and machinery used on Arrakis.

I don't know if this is how all epic sci-fi is written or if this is specific to particular works but the plot felt to be moving either far too slowly or moving in far too uninteresting way. I think the latter. It was never really exciting to me the journey of Paul and Jessica across the desert and how they get adopted into the Fremen clan.. and the Fremen rituals of Holy Mother and etc...

Unfortunately, none of the things in the book made it a page-turner to me. I gave long break between readings. It took me months to finish this book. But I have to mention that I was reading the new paperback edition. I regretted not going for a kindle edition. That could also be a reason why I read it far too slowly.

I also couldn't connect emotionally to any characters in the book which is strange as there are SO MANY characters. The villain seemed too typical and there are specific plot points that made no sense to me.

Overall, I was quite disappointed that I couldn't enjoy it more. I came to DUNE with different expectations and minimal reading experience in hardcore science fiction literature which I believe to also be contributing to how I'm feeling about this novel. I was left fully exhausted by the end and didn't pickup another novel for this month.

SETUP:
 
Our protagonists are flying on a Cessna airplane in 1980.

THE SENTENCE:

For a minute, the three of them sat in silence, within the expensive, single-engine, overhead-wing, two-hundred-mile-per-hour, sixteen-mile-per-gallon, white and red and mustard-yellow, airborne cocoon.

CONCLUSION:

If you are Dan Brown, you are probably taking notes so you can imitate that fabulous sentence structure. It was very descriptive. You probably like the way Dean Koontz fit the word ""expensive"" in there, just in case his readers thought Cessna airplanes were cheap. 

I liked the way Koontz tried to set the world record for commas per character in a published sentence. I mean, I can totally picture that Cessna in my head. Can't you? I also like the way Koontz's name makes me think about vaginas.

Speaking of vaginas, the sex scenes in this novel would make Danielle Steele fingerbang herself in a heartbeat. Just sayin'.

Thanks for reading the inaugural episode of **The Worst Sentence**. Tune in sometime in the next six months, and I might get around to doing another one. 

Until then, 

Happy reading!

"Unpopular opinion I guess: I'm glad I was assigned books in english class. I see a lot of posts on here about how people's English teachers ruined their love of reading by assigning them a book and how they are just ruined now and cant fathom picking up another book. 

I'm actually really glad my english teachers assigned me books to read. Without them I never would have tried branching out and stretching my reading interests. Books I love now such as The Once and Future King, The Book Thief, Flowers for Algernon, and Dracula all were assigned to me in high school.

To all you english teachers out there who care about literature and try to help kids broaden their reading horizons: thanks for encouraging me to try new things and not just read Harry Potter for the umpteenth time. You guys are awesome.",normal

"I read Catcher in the Rye, and I don't get why it's so popular. By the time I had finished Catcher in the Rye, I still didn't really understand why it's held as a masterpiece to a lot of people today, since I would describe it as nothing more than some twat faffing around Newyork. If anyone could give me an explanation, that would be nice.

Also, my thoughts on the book are that it was alright. Nothing really special, didn't really have anything to say, I'm sure it was more controversial when it first came out.

Also also, I'm an aussie, so it might just be an american thing I don't understand.

Edit: HOLY MOTHER MARY'S KNICKERS! I did not expect for this post to blow up. I would like to start with thanking everyone who commented and liked. I also need everyone to stop commenting, my phone is blowing up. 

So as it occurred to me that I couldn't possibly respond to every comment, I decided to make this edit. I actually wanted to adress the questions yis all had for me. 

1. I DON'T HATE THE BOOK! Jesus Christ a lot of you got the impression that I hated this book. I DO NOT! I merely just think that it's not special. It's somewhat of s good book, but just not a masterpiece. 

2. I was 17 when I read the book. So you can't really say I was too old or anything when I read it. I will pick it up when I'm older, but stop using this argument please.

3. A lot of people were saying that I needed to know the context of when it was released. Well I do know that context, but it doesn't matter. I wanted to know why people TODAY thought it was a masterpiece. I have no doubt that it was very controversial for it's time. But it's not the 1950s anymore. Because that today it's nothing more than a young adult novel. 

4. Also some people were asking if I ever suffered from mental illness. All I will say is that I have attempted suicide on multiple occasions before. 

In conclusion, I don't hate the book, it's enjoyable enough, just not a masterpiece. Also stop commenting please, my phone is literally blowing up.

"I think the ‚ÄúCool Girl‚Äù monologue from Girl Girl is a literary masterpiece of its own. EDIT: I am an idiot. I meant Gone Girl. This is what happens when you write posts late at night.

I read the book right before the movie came out and was instantly FLOORED by this monologue, and even highlighted it. So when it was portrayed in the movie so perfectly (in my own opinion, at least), I got goosebumps.

The cool girl monologue:
> Men always say that as the defining compliment, don‚Äôt they? She‚Äôs a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she‚Äôs hosting the world‚Äôs biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don‚Äôt mind, I‚Äôm the Cool Girl.

>Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they‚Äôre fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men ‚Äì friends, coworkers, strangers ‚Äì giddy over these awful pretender women, and I‚Äôd want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who‚Äôd like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I‚Äôd want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn‚Äôt really love chili dogs that much ‚Äì no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They‚Äôre not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they‚Äôre pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you‚Äôre not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn‚Äôt want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version ‚Äì maybe he‚Äôs a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he‚Äôs a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn‚Äôt ever complain. (How do you know you‚Äôre not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: ‚ÄúI like strong women.‚Äù If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because ‚ÄúI like strong women‚Äù is code for ‚ÄúI hate strong women.‚Äù)

This was *the* monologue that made it difficult for me to hate Amy, but also showed the depth of her character and her emotions.

I don‚Äôt know if anyone feels the same as I do. I guess this monologue hit me so much because as a woman, there is always a need to be Cool Girl, but there is also always a Cool Girl to hate or be envious of. To see all the ugly emotions and grievances that go along with trying to be Cool Girl, seeing Cool Girl, or living as Cool Girl.",normal

"I'm really sad that I've missed out on all the Ready Player One hate threads. I saw a bunch of people raving about this book in a book suggestion thread so I got the audio book from my library. 

My God.... it's like Eric Cartman dropped out freshman year, pounded out an incel manifesto and drowned it in Deus ex machina.

How is every female character a manic pixie dream girl? Every female character only exists for tension. He actually refers to women as females. 

Why would the entire world be obsessed with John Hughes movies in 2045? Wouldn't maybe trying to figure out the famine crises be a better use of time? A main plot point in the book is about major corporations producing new media and entertainment so its definitely not a universe where things stopped being made in the 80's. So why not just have a small group of folks in a club be into this stuff? Why does it have to be the whole planet? Damn y'all, move on. 

Japanese culture fetish. Yeah just complete that circle. 

In halfway through it. This book just came to life too day ""oh you like the Clash? Name every song that hit the US charts in the order they were released in the UK."" Then it called me a slut.

And I know this is an audiobook issue not the material but there really should have been a producer or someone who could correct Wil Wheatons pronunciations of certain words. He's mispronounced things like Aspergers (aspejers) and library (liberry).

"I just finished 11/22/63 by Stephen King. The first book I've read from start to finish about 15 years. I was never much of a reader, the last book being something like goosebumps - probably one of those 'choose you're own adventure' ones aswell. Everytime I picked up a book I found myself having to read the same page about 3 to 4 times as I just kept getting distracted. Throughout school, I skimmed through the chapters of the compulsory reading books and half-arsed the essays that had to be written about them. 

Until I woke up last week with a craving to read something that wasn't displayed on a digital screen. 11/22/63 was recommended to me and from turning to the first page I was unable to put it down. I finished the book today and can easily say that this novel took me on an adventure that I never thought possible. It was such an immersive experience and I am emotionally exhausted, in a good way. It bought joy, laughter, fear, tears. It was frustrating and satisfying at the same time. I was almost tempted to start it again straight away after finishing, but instead I've picked up a copy of Pet Semetary which I'm about to dive in to.

Anyway, I've found a new hobby and just wanted to chime in and say hello!

"My dad wants to strip the entire fiction genre from school libraries because fiction is ""nonsense"" My dad doesn't believe that fiction has any value (period.). It's not just that he prefers non-fiction-- he gets mad at Greek mythology because it is ""full of nonsense creatures not based on biology."" He dislikes the Orient Express because none of the events actually happened.

And it's not just novels: he hates anything written which is not firmly grounded in reality (Just for example: refused to finish reading the satire ""A Modest Proposal"" because it's ""nonsense"" and ""could never work in real life""). Like, I'm sure the guy would hate the Declaration of Independence if he wasn't such a die-hard patriot.

He also doesn't recognize writing as a valid art form. He doesn't think it takes any particular skill, that authors only have to ""talk out of their ass,"" make the prose flowery and unnecessarily complicated (I tried to explain what imagery was to him once, and he cited the entire technique as emblematic of poor, cheap writing). Specifically, he compared it to scientific writing, which is entirely precise and unadorned. This bit ticks me off in particular since writing is a passion of mine.

The only book he's ever liked was Jack London's ""Call of the Wild"" he read when he was 8.

And now he thinks schools should pull everything but nonfiction off of the shelves. He's worried that fiction makes kids more prone to misinformation and more likely to become flat-earthers/anti-vaxxers, etc.

How would you explain that that's not the case? That almost NONE of this is the case???

edit: he likes music and art too. It's not a vendetta against entertainment-- just THIS specific form of entertainment.

edit: he's also not religious at all, i dont know where people are getting that from. like, he actually has some kind of grudge against every god and main religious text of every culture

"PSA: Read books you want to read; not books you think you should read I was going to comment this in the other PSA for NY resolutions but, alas, I arrived late, and I doubt it would have been noticed by anyone. 

Anyway. 

I just wanted to tell you all that it's fine to read whatever you want to read. You don't have to read the classics just because they're there. If you want to read something else - something that interests you more, then go for it! 

I used to say 'I want to read X number of books this year/month' etc and usually I'd end up picking almost entirely from the classics. But I've got news for you - just because they're universally acknowledged as 'classics' doesn't mean they have universal appeal. Frequently, I'd end up abandoning the goal. 

You might find them slow or dull or you don't connect with the characters because you're a 30-year-old man who works as an engineer in Manchester and you struggle to relate to the woes of 19th-century socialites, soldiers and vagabonds. ^(That's not a description of me btw)

I used to find it difficult to read if I was reading something I didn't wholeheartedly enjoy. These days I pick a few books I believe I'll like and then follow it up with a classic I'm unsure of. 

But ultimately my message is that you shouldn't feel pressured to read certain things - read because you enjoy it not because it's something to check off. 

For me - this means my next 5 list looks like this: 

*Ayoade on Top* - Richard Ayoade

*Lanny* - Max Porter

*The Wall* - John Lanchester

*I, Claudius* - Robert Graves

*The Master and Margarita* - Mikhail Bulgakov

"Just read The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy and I'm blown away. This might come up quite often since it's pretty popular, but I completely fell in love with a story universe amazingly well-built and richly populated. It's full of absurdity, sure, but it's a very lush absurdity that is internally consistent enough (with its acknowledged self-absurdity) to seem like a ""reasonable"" place for the stories. Douglas Adams is also a very, very clever wordsmith. He tickled and tortured the English language into some very strange similes and metaphors that were bracingly descriptive.

"The Iliad: I'm enjoying it so far but I can't help cracking up at the way these dudes will just pause in the chaos of battle to shit-talk their opponent for an entire page This happens a lot throughout the story, but I found this one in particular hilarious. Note, this is all happening in the thick of an intense battle with men fighting all around:

>Paris drew back his arm from the bow  
and shot. Not in vain did the arrow fly from his hand,  
but hit Diomedes' right foot, on the flat part: the shaft went through,  
stuck fast in the ground. Then, with loud laughter, Paris  
sprang out from his hiding place and shouted boastfully:  
""You're hit! Not in vain did my shaft fly! Oh, how I wish  
I'd caught your nether belly, and taken your life away!  
Then would the Trojans have had some relief from their troubles,  
who now tremble before you like bleating sheep with a lion.""

>To him, quite unafraid, strong Diomedes replied:  
""Bowman, foul-mouthed cursor, pretty-locks, ogler of virgins! --  
If you'd only make trial of me face to face, wearing armor,  
then your bow and your showers of arrows would not protect you;  
and even now your boast is just to have scratched my foot!  
I don't care -- it could well have been a daft child or a woman  
that shot me, so blunt the shafts of a weakling, a nobody!  
Very different indeed, if it only grazes its target,  
is the sharp spear sped by *my* hand: it brings a man instant death,  
and the cheeks of his widow are torn in death and mourning,  
and his children are orphaned, while he reddens the earth  
with his blood, and rots, more vultures than women round him.""

I think it's the fact that Paris basically pinned Diomedes in place with an arrow through the foot, creating the perfect opportunity to take him out while he's hindered, but instead opts to stand out of arms reach and boast about hitting him, that makes this passage so funny to me. I guess that's a part of Paris' character: He's got a loud mouth but not enough courage to take on Diomedes, even in this weakened state.

I would love to see a parody of The Iliad that captures this; all the soldiers around them pausing the fight to let them duke it out verbally, ooooooo-ing at some of the biggest burns.",normal
"Authors who describe EVERY single female that appears in thier book as if they are a potential lay is a way to instantly lose my respect. It's just lazy.

I dont care how down to earth or likeable a main character is. When the perspective comes across like every  woman they encounter is either lusting after them, or being sized-up and put into different categories of dream-girl archetypes, it turns the otherwise relatable main character into a leering creep. 

Can you imagine reading a book where every male character was introduced as simple archetypes like ""bad boy type"", or by the size of thier package, despite thier role in the story?


Edit:
If it matters, I also like women and get the appeal of reading about boobies, but I dont need to know about every booby if said booby isnt important to the story.

If you like your books filled with dream girls and ladies who breast boobily, power to you. You read those books, and I will choose others. The authors will still.make money, and I dont have to finish an off-putting book. Everyone wins! 

Yes, romance books and books with sex and lust being part of the story are not worthy of scorn and obviously get a pass.

I'm personally going to continue to think its weird and off-putting when a book in which sex and lust is NOT the story (in which the main character is NOT intended to be sex obsessed) clearly chooses to reduce a specific group of people in the book (women) down to sexual fantasies.",normal

"OC just realized what my English teacher did for me when I was a kid I'm at my mid twenties, surfing YouTube, a clip of Matilda randomly showed up. It made me realize something, ended up crying and laughing at the same time.

I read Matilda when I was 11 as a part of an assignment project my English teacher gave me. I was the child with single parents, in our place single mothers and their family is still treated with discrimination. My school was no different. I had teachers and parents heavily prejudiced against me and my mom. It also didn't help that my mother had mental, economic issues, which made her a terrible mother.

Our English teacher was in her mid twenties, and she was stern, everyone used to be scared of her. That summer we all got different books to write assignment on. I think I was the only one given Matilda by her, even though it was a little advanced for 11-year-old's language assignment. I remember crying and having all kinds of emotions, I was relating so much with Matilda. I was also parenting myself, dealing with abuse, also a bookworm. There weren't many books at that time I could relate to. A book that tells me someone like me deserves care and support as well, horrible parents and teachers are not right just because they are adults, to find solace in books, if you cannot find in company.

A few years after that I became an orphan, around that same time period the young stern teacher who looked after me without me realizing it, got diagnosed with cancer. She died, leaving her husband and infant devastated.

I want to be able to call her or go to my old school, find her and hug her. Tell her how much her guidance has helped me become a person I can be proud of today. I want to thank her for being one of the best teacher in my lifetime. She was young, she was nearly the age I am right now, and she did so well. The world is unfair, I knew that, but At this moment this hits me extra hard.

Update: my school went through a major administrator change, very few old teachers remained. And given this happened more than decades ago when social network wasn't a thing, nobody really knows where her family members are. Specially I think our previous principal could be kind of obnoxious, and we felt the school was kind of avoided by the family members. The ex principal kind of made it into a thing when she was sick, (They used to make anything a thing about themselves. ) So maybe it was intentional choice, I'll still try to find and contact a really old teacher who is the only possible person to know anything, though he left school. But, this maybe the last update.",normal

He also admitted that that's exactly what he did in his office and has no intention of reading them. I don't know why but that pissed me off a bit. I personally refuse to own any books that I will not read. I have given away, such books in the past. I like to keep my bookshelf filled with books/things I treasure.

* Bechdel Test? Pass
* Science Gibberish? Plenty
* A rather bland story involving time travel.  Uninteresting characters and dull plot are used to flesh out a none-too-thrilling world.  Saving grace is that it's super short.

1958 - A Case of Conscience by James Blish

* What if alien society seems too perfect?
* Worth a read? No, but a soft no.
* Primary Driver (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Plenty
* Not bad, but not that great.  It's mostly world building, which is half baked.  Also the religion stuff doesn't really do it for me - possibly because the characters are each one character trait, so there's no believable depth to zealotry.

1959 - Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein

* Welcome to the Mobile Infantry, the military of the future!
* Worth a read? **Yes**
* Primary Driver (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Minimal
* Status as classic well earned.  Both a fun space military romp and a condemnation of the military.  No worrisome grey morality.  Compelling protagonist and excellent details keep book moving at remarkable speed.

Edit: Many people have noted that Starship Troopers is purely pro military.  I stand corrected; having seen the movie before reading the book, I read the condemnation into the original text.  There are parts that are anti-bureaucracy (in the military) but those are different.  This does not alter my enjoyment of the book, just figured it was worth noting.

1959 - A Canticle for Leibowitz

* The Order of Leibowitz does its best to make sure that next time will be different.
* Worth a read? **Yes**
* Primary Driver (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Minimal
* I love the first section of this book, greatly enjoy the second, and found the third decent.  That said, if it was only the first third, the point of the book would still be clear.  Characters are very well written and distinct.

Notes:

These are all Hugo winners, as none of the other prizes were around yet.

I've sorted these by date of publication using this spreadsheet  [https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/8z1oog/i\_made\_a\_listspreadsheet\_of\_all\_the\_winners\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/8z1oog/i_made_a_listspreadsheet_of_all_the_winners_of/)  so a huge thanks to u/velzerat

I'll continue to post each decade of books when they're done, and do a final master list when through everything, but it's around 200 books, so it'll be a hot minute.  I'm also only doing the Novel category for now, though I may do one of the others as well in the future.

If there are other subjects or comments that would be useful to see in future posts, please tell me!  I'm trying to keep it concise but informative.

Any questions or comments? Fire away!

Edit!

The Bechdel Test is a simple question: do two named female characters converse about something other than a man.  Whether or not a book passes is not a condemnation so much as an observation; it was the best binary determination I could find.  Seems like a good way to see how writing has evolved over the years.

Further Edit!

Many people have noted that science fiction frequently has characters who defy gender - aliens, androids, and so on - looking at you, Left Hand of Darkness!  I'd welcome suggestions for a supplement to the Bechdel Test that helps explore this further.  I'd also appreciate suggestions of anything comparable for other groups or themes (presence of different minority groups, patriarchy, militarism, religion, and so on), as some folks have suggested.  I'll see what I can do, but simplicity is part of the goal here, of course.

Edit on Gibberish!

This is what I mean:

""There must be intercommunication between all the Bossies. It was not difficult to found the principles on which this would operate. Bossy functioned already by a harmonic vibration needed to be broadcast on the same principle as the radio wave. No new principle was needed. Any cookbook engineer could do it‚Äîeven those who believe what they read in the textbooks and consider pure assumption to be proved fact. It was not difficult to design the sending and receiving apparatus, nor was extra time consumed since this small alteration was being made contiguous with the production set up time of the rest. The production of countless copies of the brain floss itself was likewise no real problem, no more difficult than using a key-punched master card to duplicate others by the thousands or millions on the old-fashioned hole punch computer system."" - They'd Rather Be Right

"I finished Stephen King‚Äôs 11/22/63 last night. I‚Äôm still shaken up. This book is unbelievable. I think I took 4 or 5 days to finish it, but I think this book is best savored rather than binged.

I loved every single page of this ridiculously well-written story. Characters floored me. Dialogue floored me. The *story* floored me. I don‚Äôt give a singular shit if the historical accuracy isn‚Äôt there; I‚Äôm an American and I read this strictly as fiction. In my eyes, the people who write off this book because they disagree with King‚Äôs interpretation of the assassination are fools.

And dear God, that ending. Yeah, I‚Äôm a guy who sheds tears a lot‚ÄîI mean a *lot*‚Äîwhile reading or watching. Just recently, I probably cried during like 3 or 4 movies. And during this book, my cheeks were soaked during the performance of *Of Mice and Men.* It was such a heartwarming and simultaneously heartbreaking moment. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but I also saw it as a little foreshadowing for this ending. Now, for the ending itself. I didn‚Äôt cry at all. I have no idea why. The opposite of George, I was dry-eyed in those final pages but not so during the rest of the book. It was so weird, I can‚Äôt explain it, especially considering that the ending was incredibly heartbreaking and should bring anyone who resonated with this story to tears.

This is the best book I‚Äôve ever read. Now that I‚Äôm finished with it‚Äîit‚Äôs the morning after‚ÄîI have no idea where to go next. I know I‚Äôm going to read another one of King‚Äôs books, but just the thought that there won‚Äôt be another chance for Sadie and George will haunt me for a while, I think.

"Douglas Adams' greatest work isn't Hitchhiker's, or any fiction for that matter... In my opinion, Adams' greatest work is Last Chance to See. This non-fiction book records the trips Adams took around the world, together with zoologist Mark Carwardine, in order to visit various critically endangered species and observe them in their natural habitats. Last Chance to See not only displays Adams' funniest writing, but also his most introspective and poignant. 

If you haven't read this book and you are a fan of Hitchhiker's or Dirk Gently, it's a must-read in my opinion.

"Writers need to lose their obsession with trilogies Just read book 2 of a novel I read a while back which I absolutely adored. One of the best books I've ever read, not even exaggerating. A breath of fresh air.

Then book 2 came out. It's bad. Like...*really* bad. Almost unrecognizable. I'm super bummed out. And there is going to be a third book. And strange as it sounds, I'm 100% confident book 3 will be better than book 2.

Why? Because I've seen this SO MANY times. Great book 1, but the writer is obsessed with making it a trilogy, because that's what so many other writers are doing. So you get a book 2 were very little of note actually happens. The writer needs to fill up space so it can become a proper trilogy. And it's nothing like book 1 which you loved so much. But then book 3 is all fire and lighting, because everything gets squeezed into it for a climactic ending.

There is no shame in having a series be 2 books. And if you have a story that has so much to tell it needs to be 3 or more books, by all means. Just don't make it a trilogy for the sake of it being a trilogy, because readers will notice very fast that it actually shouldn't be 3 books content-wise.",normal
"Books set in the covid-reality are going to start appearing and I don't want to read them.

But I hate this reality and I don't cope with it well. I just hate the thought of reading about it, it's just too fresh.

Of course I have a lot to read. Books published before 2021 or new books set in the past, fantasy/SF etc., that's more than enough. But I would love to just be able to pick up a new thriller or mainstream novel without plunging into the same shit I have to live in.

* The string that looks like a noose is my attic access pull cord
* Yes, I have Battlefield Earth.  It's a favorite SciFi adventure story detached from Scientology.  Lots of fun, I've read it multiple times.
* Yes, Twilight is there.  I have read them and enjoyed them.  I did it before the movies and I have no regrets.  I have read and enjoyed many books that fall all over the continuum of quality.  I'm not a fan of bagging on books even if I didn't like them. You can keep yelling at me about it but is it really worth your time?
* I estimate, roughly, that there are 1,200 books.  I have read somewhere between 70-80% of the whole library.  It's closer to 90% if you just count SciFi/Fantasy books.
* Yes, the Walking Dead omnibuses are out of order.  I've forgotten the face of my father.",normal

"To parents who are really restrictive of what their kids read: why? I work in a library and it's a regular occurrence to hear kids upset that their parents won't let them take out a certain book. They always give the same few excuses:  

""This looks too difficult for you."" So what? Kids need to be challenging themselves. It's never the case that these kids wandered into the adult section and picked up a Henry James book or a 50 Shades knockoff. It's usually a popular children's chapter book they pick up. If they're interested in the story in the first place, they would power through the difficulties and just maybe become better readers. Or you can spend some time reading the book with them and helping them become better readers.

""You've read this before."" Is it so bad to read the same book multiple times? Even adults who claim to love reading think it's silly to reread books. Getting to know the story better means you'll understand it better and get a deeper insight into it. Obviously if they want to read a book multiple times it means they have a deeper connection with it. Why take away that pleasure?

""We have enough books already."" Our limit's like, 50 books. Are you worried you won't be able to keep track of them all and accidentally return them late? Then do what some of my coworkers do and come up with a system. Teach your kids some responsibility. Are you worried they won't finish it all before they're due? Well, I guess they'll learn the hard way not to splurge and get too much at the same time. 

""This just doesn't look good."" Now this I genuinely don't understand. Why force your own unfounded opinions on your child? Why would you teach them to be judgemental and literally judge books by their covers? Why would you limit the wonderful world of books and reading?

"I just recently discovered libraries, and they are cool AF. I‚Äôm exaggerating. Of course I didn‚Äôt recently discover them, but I hadn‚Äôt actually been to one since I was a kid until just recently, because I have a 1 1/2 year old kid who just wants to be read to all day. Me and her mom can‚Äôt afford to buy her new books often, so I googled library branches near me, just so we could get her new books to cycle through on a regular basis, but I did not remember what a tremendous resource libraries could be. They are cool AF. And librarians know everything. 

Also, taking my baby to the library twice a week got me and my wife back into reading. We‚Äôve always liked reading, but we would always buy new books whenever we wanted to read something. Now we‚Äôre both reading multiple books a week.

"I'm normally a very unemotional person As I stated in the title, I'm not an emotional person. We (my wife, our 7yo son 3yo daughter, and myself) lost our house to a fire last May. My collection was just over 1100 books, and I truly loved every single one of them. I went through every identifiable item in the house with the inventory specialist our insurance company sent, because I don't really have an emotional attachment to any of the ""things,"" whereas my wife sobbed at even the thought of seeing it. Fast forward to Christmas. Behind the boxes of Legos for our son, and the princess gear for our daughter, were stack after stack of books, lovingly picked by my beautiful wife. Stephen Ambrose, Aldous Huxley, Ken Follett, William Golding... 35 books in all. Hard to explain to her why I couldn't muster a single tear in the hospital when our daughter was born, yet couldn't stop the biblical torrent streaming down my 38yo cheeks because of a few King novels. 

Update: Thank you all so much for the responses! I didn't expect this much outpouring of support and well-wishes, and don't really know how to process it. It feels wrong to, for lack of a better way of putting it, mourn the loss of ""things."" We were out when the fire happened, so no one was hurt (our two cats were home but came out of it unscathed), and grieving over possessions leaves me with an overwhelming feeling of guilt. I guess that's what led to my post in the first place. Having an emotional response to this beautiful gift has left me feeling more things than I know how to process, and writing about it has, surprisingly, helped. 

Thank you all again.

"Professor Stephen Hawking has passed away at the age of 76 We have lost one of the greatest minds in history today as Professor Stephen William Hawking has passed away on March 14, 2018 at the age of 76.

"I can‚Äôt breathe. Black lives matter. As the gap of the political divide in our world grows deeper, we would like to take a few minutes of your time or express our support of equal treatment, equal justice, to express solidarity with groups which have been marginalized for too long, and to outright say black lives matter. The AskReddit moderators have decided to disable posting for [8 minutes and 46 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjKo_rpVid0) ‚Äî the time George Floyd was held down by police ‚Äî and we will lock comments on front page posts. Our hope is that people reading this will take a moment to pause and reflect on what can be done to improve the world. **This will take place at 8PM CDT.**

AskReddit is a discussion forum with which we want to encourage discussion of a wide range of topics. Now, more than ever, it‚Äôs important to talk about the topics that divide us and use AskReddit to approach these conversations with open minds and respectful discussion.

This is also an important opportunity to reiterate our stance on moderation. Simply put, we believe it‚Äôs our duty to ensure neutral and fair moderation so people with opposing views can use our platform as a place to have these important and much needed discussions about their views, our hope being that the world will benefit as a result. We feel that it is our duty to make sure that AskReddit is welcoming to all. To that end, we have a set of rules to ensure posts encourage discussion and to ensure users feel safe, welcome, and respected. As always, blatant statements of racism or any other kind of bigotry **will not be tolerated**. We want users to be able to express themselves and their views. Remember that everyone here and everyone you see in the news are human beings, too.

With all of that in mind, we reiterate our encouragement for people to discuss these hard, and often uncomfortable, topics as a way to find alignment, unity, and to progress as a society.

We ask that you take a few minutes to research a charity that aligns with your beliefs or a cause you care about and that you donate to it if you‚Äôre able. [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/george-floyd-protests-bail-funds-police-brutality-black-lives-matter-1008259/) put together a lot of links to different funds across many states if you would like to use this as a place to start.

"How do you feel about ‚Äôhow would you feel?‚Äô posts being banned? We‚Äôve gotten a lot of feedback on this one. A lot of feedback. We‚Äôve all seen the ‚Äúhow would you feel about \_\_\_\_‚Äù in which the OP is just posting what is considered a ""shower thought"" which is aimed to ask users to support a largely popular concept in a way that fits AskReddit‚Äôs rules. Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don‚Äôt have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback we‚Äôve received, we‚Äôve decided to remove these posts moving forward.

We do understand that there‚Äôs some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions.

For example:

* ‚Äú*How would you feel about a ‚Äôif you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,‚Äô button for Reddit?*‚Äù is really just a feature suggestion.
* ‚Äú*How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?*‚Äù is a discussion question.

Our philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your ‚ÄùHow would you feel‚Äù post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we‚Äôll be happy to manually review.

Thank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy. We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration. If you or anyone you know has been diagnosed with mesoth...sorry, wrong script...if you have feedback for us, we always appreciate it as we want to give people the best experience in AskReddit.

"Moratorium on questions related to US Politics Effective immediately until a further notice, there will be a moratorium on all questions related to US politics, including but not limited to: the election, political parties, the candidates & their running mates, any of the branches of government.

We have understandably been getting a heavy increase in political posts, but they‚Äôve been slowly overloading the sub. We want to give users a break from such posts, especially since multiple people have reached out to us about this issue.

While there have been civil discussions around these and other similar topics, we as a mod team have found that most discussions around US politics devolve into slapfights and insults. Therefore, we are placing this ban on such questions for the stated time to help ensure that r/AskReddit remains a welcoming environment for all.

"Mod statement on the Aimee Challenor controversy Like many of you, we are disgusted and appalled by the allegations that have come to light recently regarding Aimee Challenor.  We are not planning on shutting down r/AskReddit, as other subreddits have been doing, because we think that continuing to provide a forum for discussion is valuable.  We hope that the admins will be more forthcoming with information about the situation - we're currently as in the dark as everybody else is.

We do want to note that while we are not shutting down or removing mentions of Aimee Challenor, our normal rules **still apply and will be enforced**.  Posts or comments about the situation are allowed so long as they don't violate the rules, but using the situation as an excuse to farm karma, spew transphobic rhetoric, or doxx people will not be tolerated and will result in removals and bans, as always.  Our normal rules also apply to posts that are not asking open-ended discussion questions.  We have removed several posts today because they were not questions, or were yes/no questions.  Please read over the rules before posting so as to ensure your post follows them.
