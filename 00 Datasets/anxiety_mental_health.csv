"Elections and Politics Hello friends!

It's that time of the year again. We have always intended for r/Anxiety  to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.

Political anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:

**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.

**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:

[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)

[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)

[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)

**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.

**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.

**If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services. Here is a** [list of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/wiki/index/resources/) **as well as a link to a** [global index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) **of emergency numbers.**

"My anxiety won't stop I'm working on not catastrophizing the results of the election but as a female my anxiety spikes every time that I think about the next four years. I get to a point where I'm okay but then I see other women on social media talk about Christian fundamentalism and how they want to take away our right to vote, financial autonomy, and bodily autonomy. I know that there are realistically things in place that would prevent this, but my brain keeps going back to catastrophizing about what if they just ignore the law. I just can't relax. How can I get rid of this anxiety and need to be prepared for every possible outcome??? ",anxiety
"Does anyone else get caught in ""thought loops""? So first of all I'm not actually sure if I have anxiety or if im just someone who overthinks stuff too much but  does anyone else get stuck thinking about a specific thing and then gets more and more stressed about it even though it isn't anything serious? 

For me it's sometimes health related (I don't go to the doctor unless I REALLY need to but I do get stuck googling my symptoms and getting worried about basically nothing).Or I'm worried that my dentist is annoyed at me even though I have an appointment and he is a nice guy.

Or socially related for example at work : I work as a cleaner in a school and for some reason get worried about the teachers seeing me and getting mad at me even though I literally work there and they are all nice to me when they see me.

Logically know that I am just imagining things but in the moment it feels real 

DAE feel like this ?

"Overdosed a significant amount of lorazepam and don’t know what to do I have been taking this drug for over a year. Last month, I took 10mg of lorazepam and basically lost consciousness. I sleepwalked through work for the next two days without any memory of what happened and when I regained my consciousness, I found out that I have taken 42 pills during that 2-day span. 3 days later I suddenly passed out at work and was sent to the hospital. The doctor suspected that I had a seizure because I bit my tougue. I am discharged now and haven’t taken any lorazepam since then but it is hard. My anxiety level is at all time high. I am completely dysfunctional in life. My life is a mess. I don’t know what to do besides sitting on the couch crying all day.",anxiety
"People who healed from anxiety please share your experience  Hey, 

I’ve been struggling the past months with anxiety, with fears I thought I had healed from. But suddenly old stuff came up and I was in an anxiety loop once again. I isolated from friends and got depressed.

Such times can give you lots of hopelessness, moments where you ask yourself if it will get better someday.

So therefore I ask you for sharing some success stories to give hope to people who are currently struggling.

***UPDATE: Thank you all for sharing your stories, it gave me hope to keep going and hoping for better days to come ❤️ ",anxiety

"Fear of Death I’ve had multiple close deaths back to back within 3 years and I feel like I’m next. I never want to die. My anxiety takes over me and I feel like I don’t have many years to live. I’m willing to eat healthy and be healthy, typically I have been. But the thought of turning 30 and not having many years to live is causing severe anxiety. 

I find myself wide awake at night and sleepy during the day. I feel like my head is going 100 miles an hour all the time. Many times I catch myself not even breathing. 

I have nobody to help me and I’m alone in my thoughts. Does anyone else experience this and how they have overcome this? Or at least manage it because I just want to be happy. I never thought about death until recently. 

Thank you. ",anxiety
"Called 911 for the first time; heart anxiety  Jesus. I’ve had bad moving and floating and unsteady sensations for months and weakness walking and standing but never considered my heart. I didn’t feel good, got up and drove to work, talked to my therapist on the way and got stressed, was pretty unbalanced and felt weird working, I have a habit of checking my chest lately. When I felt it it felt like my beat was missing or fading and stopped and I instantly felt doom and weak and hot and I was like WOAH. I was 20 miles from home, phone was gonna die and I called 911 and laid down and felt horrible with shaking and tension in my chest, trembling and weakness. They came and did a ekg and blood pressure and blood oxygen and they said i seem okay, put me in the ambulance and said I really didn’t need to go to the Hospital but I was pretty afraid and weak and shaky and went but of course I waited in the waiting room and they didn’t do shit, like my usual hospital does. They just let me out. 

 I was just seen at the ER weeks ago with the full rundown and then cardiologist did the ultrasound and ekg and said my heart looks okay, so I don’t know why I have heart or heart attack worries now but I do 

Really need some advice. ",anxiety

"My current battle with Anxiety and depression, how i’m beginning to end it. Hi everyone, I hope yous are all doing well. All my live I have been riddled with anxiety and it really has had me in a chokehold for many, many years. The last 3 years of my life had been the darkest and it truly seems surreal I can look back on it and SEE it and am starting to understand it for what it is. It really had full control of me, my mind, my body, my thoughts, my voice and the choices I made. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and I’m starting to really see it and most importantly feel it. Medication and therapy did kickstart this for me and the most awful times turned into just about bearable but life still wasn’t enjoyable, it gave me that tiny bit of mental strength to begin questioning “what is happening? Why is this happening? Is this really me?”. These questions initially scared me and my mind was telling me all the wrong answers to them, trying to instil false reasoning like… Im just born this way or it’s because of what I’ve witnessed, how I’ve been treated, there’s nothing I can do I’m stuck like this and I’ve just gotta bear with it for however long till I meet my demise. This is all not true and I’m really starting to realise and believe all these reasons of “why am I like this” was all something in me that was bigger, stronger and something I was simply identifying with involuntarily. My mind had tricked me for years controlling my emotions, reactions what I think, how I see things and how I should represent myself, I just wasn’t the real me that I was tricked into believing. It took me a very long time to reach this point but there is a you that’s in there, it just needs to be accessed. A major factor in this turning in a more positive direction has been reading and talking to people who have unlocked their real ‘being’. A book I can massively thank and couldn’t suggest more is ‘The Power of Now’. Reading many posts on here I can whole heartedly relate to the many of people that are struggling with their own battle with anxiety and depression. I wanted to share this just in case it helps anyone like its begging to help me, I’ve still got a long way to go but I’ve finally started to get on a road that I’m moving down and wouldn’t wish any of what I’ve experienced on a soul in the world. I realised it was only me that can change this and no other intervention was just going to solve any of my problems. It starts with you. Thankyou for taking time to read and I hope you’re doing well!

"Rain makes my anxiety much worse. It’s very rainy in my country these days. It’s been raining the whole week. 
For some reason, the rain, even when it’s mild, always made me afraid and extremely uncomfortable. 
I’ve been going through an extremely anxious period of my life, and the rain increases my anxiety so much. 
I don’t know how to explain why this happens. 
What can I do about this feeling? Thankful for any advice :)

"Anxiety  Anxiety just holds even a very capable individual back in life. It's like a rope tied around your body that prevents you from going anywhere far. 

I see much less intelligent and much less capable people than me going places, achieving success, having a great social life and making lot of money. 

And here I am, languishing in a middle management job, unable to do much more.",anxiety
"Passing up a job opportunity  Fairly recently, my boss told me there would be a job opportunity opening up at my place of employment. I thought about it, and decided to go for it and apply. Because you don’t know if you don’t try right? Well a month passed since I applied, and I started to be ok with everything. I felt like it was indicative that it wasn’t my time. They went with someone else. I had moved on and was content with at least putting my name in the hat.

Everything changed on Wednesday.
I got notified I moved onto the next stage of the interview process and was given the pre-interview assignments. Suddenly, I felt the biggest pit in my stomach. I didn’t understand the questions. The more I thought about the job, I delved into a panic attack. I didn’t eat much. I cried so much. I felt like my world was ending. I got feedback from a few other upper managers at my job and I got a variation of ‘do what’s right for you, but what’s the harm in doing the assignments?’… and after a while I started to agree with them. I thought to try to do the assignments, but when I tried all the panic attack feelings came back. I felt so much dread. I just couldn’t do it. I think there’s something to be said about feeling this way about a job I don’t even have and there’s no guarantee I would get it. 

I don’t think it’s wrong acknowledging that it’s not the right fit, that I’m content in my current position, and I don’t want to move up the ladder at this moment in time. But I struggle with being a people pleaser and the feeling like I let people down. And that’s what I felt like, I felt like I was letting those around me down for not going for it. But I had to do what’s right for me. 

I let the proper personnel know that the job was not a good fit for me, I thanked them for the opportunity, and I wished them all the luck in finding the best candidate. I got a response from a top management telling me they understood, but they really encouraged me to do the assignment, that my background would help me and it’s supposed to be difficult. 

And all those feelings of feeling like I let someone down came back up. I don’t want to leave this place. It’s not perfect, but I don’t hate my job. I’m content, I have a good group of people around me. It just doesn’t feel right to change jobs. The grass isn’t always greener on the other side. My biggest fear is what if I get this job, but six months in I realize it wasn’t a good fit, but I can’t go back to my old job. 

Deep down I know I’m doing the right thing, but that weight on my chest just won’t leave. ",anxiety
"Trouble dealing with constant anxiety these past few months my anxiety has been getting worse by the day and it's getting scary. It's gotten to the point now where I'm anxious as much as I'm awake. to deal with the anxiety I had a year ago I started smoking weed and I've been doing so every single day for about 10 months. cannabis has been the only thing that truly helped me deal with my anxiety through daily life. however I clearly depend on it and I have enough reasons to believe it's bad for me but I just don't know how to fill the gap. I feel like nothing I'm trying is helping me, not the 5 different antidepressants that were supposed to help with anxiety nor the xanaxes or other benzodiazepines that I just hate taking, not the CBD, not the therapy, not the people around me doing so much to help me , not me, straight nothing.

I'm looking for any advice on how to deal with severe anxiety because it's impeding on my daily life and my mental health. I'm not sure what I'm expecting but I'm pretty desperate thank you",anxiety

"I really just need to feel like I’m ok and I will be ok  I’ve been battling anxiety during the past month and a half and I feel like I’m a little better every week. Started therapy two weeks ago and I’m feeling good about it. But the physical symptoms out of nowhere really scare me and I think I might have health anxiety. 
I’ve done all the heart tests (EKG, 24h monitor, echocardiogram) so I’m not anxious about having heart problems or a heart attack, but in the past days I’ve felt lightheaded a couple of times, felt like I was going to faint (even though I never did) and it scares me and makes me think I have a neurological problem. My general health is also good and I don’t have any deficiencies or thyroid problems. I’ve considered going to the doctor again just to talk about this and maybe get like head scans, but maybe I’m just catastrophyzing again. Maybe I’ll just put myself in that horrible fear zone again.

"What it means to sit with our anxiety, my take Hi everyone, been lurking this sub for a bit. Like many of you I found this sub while looking for answers, guidance, and support. I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, it is something that started years ago for me. I went through an experience that I didn’t think was traumatic at the time but over time became the focus of my anxiety. I was able to live a pretty normal life though, but suddenly this year it began to seep into my day to day life and activities. Don’t know what caused it but it scared me, enough that I finally decided to do something about it and so I began the journey of learning about anxiety and how to truly address it. 

I have found many good resources over the last several months that have really helped me to understand anxiety a bit better and to develop a plan for tackling it. As many resources suggest I am choosing to face my anxiety which entails exposing myself to anxiety inducing things/places/events and sitting with and through the discomfort. I did not understand what it meant to sit with the discomfort, I understood the words but I just didn’t know how it would actually work. I tried it anyway and slowly but surely I think I kinda got it, but I wasn’t sure. I still couldn’t explain it or conceptualize it. Then it came to me while trying to explain to my wife and I think it may be helpful for others.

Think about a time you ate something spicy, remember how it slowly build up until your mouth felt like it was on fire. Remember that no matter how much water you drank it provided little relief. All you could do was pant and sit there wishing it stop. It was uncomfortable. But soon it enough you felt it subside, still burned but definitely peaked and was coming down. Eventually you would just go back to normal. Now the next time you eat something spicy you know what feeling awaits you. If you are like me you kept eating spicy and eventually you built a tolerance. You still felt the tingling in your mouth but now you kinda enjoy it. Food didn’t taste the same without it.

The feeling of anxiety can be overwhelming but it just that, a feeling, just like when your mouth is on fire. You sit with it letting it burn but it will peak and will begin to subside. It’s terribly uncomfortable but again just a feeling. I have noticed an improvement since I started this plan of exposure. What helped me too was realizing that the world was feeding me spicy food (metaphorically) regardless if I wanted it or not, so I decided that if I was going to eat spicy that I better learn how to use it to my advantage and learn to sit with it to build my tolerance. Hope this helps someone make sense of what it means to sit with anxiety like it did me. 

EDIT: If it was not clear, the spicy food reference is an example/metaphor for understanding what sitting with anxiety can feel like in terms of emtions, feelings, and sensations. Eating spicy food will not help cure anxiety nor have I ever seen any scientific source say as such.",anxiety
"It never ends I've been super stressed. Also my PMDD has been acting up, so of course I'm getting really bad intrusive thoughts and hate myself and hate everyone else but still- Nobody gets better, not people with anxiety, or drug addicts, or anyone. There is no better. There's just living, day by day until you inevitably fuck yourself over again, then the cycle repeats. It's all so fucking tedious. I've been stuck this way my whole life. I get ""better"", I manage to leave the house and eat more and make friends, then something will trigger a breakdown and I'll be right back to wallowing in my bedroom, cutting myself and listening to sad music, wishing I was dead. It never ends. All those slightly happy, slightly ""better"" moments don't seem worth it to me. I'll never be normal and I'll never be happy.

"Responsibility Phobia Please be gentle - I know the following might sound ridiculous and pathetic.

I have started university but just the concept of the responsibility alone has seen me not sleep for days, relying on benzodiazepine use and waking up with a racing heart and gasping from stress-induced breathing pauses.

This then manifests as health anxiety. I believe it’s my minds way of making an elusive problem more tangible. I am in hell.

I am basically a recluse, and I have no friends and no direction, and I was hoping to give myself some direction by doing what I have always wanted to do via a university degree.

I used to work at a job that put immense pressure and responsibility on me alone, without providing sufficient training or support, enforcing up to 16hr shifts, and if things went wrong it was all on me.

This was three years ago. Since then, I have been unable to work, and I have battled immensely to find a new path.

I also went through psychological abuse throughout my childhood and currently, and I have a history of “Pure O OCD”.

I’ve always wanted to study at university, and I have always had a relevant interest, but I tend to get a lock on type thing, where I obsess and tear myself to pieces over the concepts of expectation and responsibility.

The paradox is that if I was mentally able to grapple with the course, it might change my life and provide direction and fulfilment.

I am shattered from no sleep, and I am angry with myself for being so weak and unable to see it for what it is, and take it day by day.

I feel as though I might have to postpone my degree until this rough patch eases (if it does).

Anxiety connected to eating? I find lots of times when I start to eat I randomly get really bad anxiety and just feel like there's a hole in my stomach kinda feeling.

"Friend found my Reddit post. I can’t stop freaking out. 


I am very confused and embarrassed at the moment and have no idea what to do. Basically, I ranted/let off some steam about some stuff regarding my friends on a couple of subreddits a couple of months apart (mainly having to do with me feeling envious or resentful about some stuff, they did nothing malicious per se, but I am a flawed person and ultimately just wanted advice on how to deal with these emotions and letting off steam), and I was discovered. I know this because they discovered the posts, and texted me about it, how I need to stop posting, etc. I didn’t read the full messages they texted me yet, but I honestly don’t have the mental energy to deal with it.

"I screwed up and skipped my meds for 4 days. Now what? Honestly not sure if this ok or even a good place to ask this but hoped maybe someone else has done it and knows what you’re supposed to do after.

I bought a week long pill case thing to fill weekly with my meds and supplements so I don’t have to open it all nightly. I made an extra one the night I filled it. So 8 days. Tonight I noticed I had an extra salt pill in my slot so I opened the next one thinking it would be missing. It wasn’t but I realized my Fluoxetine wasn’t there. Opened the 3 remaining slots and NONE have it. 

I can only logically assume that the first 4 didn’t have it, either. Idk how I messed it up this badly but I guess I skipped that bottle when I filled it and somehow didn’t even notice it was missing all this time? I’ve been “sick” all week. I now realize it was actually withdrawal. I know how that feels but guess my brain didn’t catch on because I had no reason to be in withdrawal. 

So I fixed the remaining slots and took one for today but should I take extra to make up for what I missed or does it not work like that? 

I went through 3 weeks of HELL waiting for this med to kick in. Did I just RESET that?! Or is 4 days not enough for it to totally leave my system? I’m worried because the withdrawal was a lot better today. I’ll be so mad if I have to do that 3 week bullshit all over again because I messed up filling a pill holder. Ugh",anxiety
"I got scammed and need to vent so a few days ago I got scammed with a ton of money. I sold an item cuz I want to help my mom and pay her things, buy her cool stuff and all because we've been in a tight spot with money these past months. but I got scammed and I try to think its not my fault since im just a teen and really stupid but I cant, im constantly thinking about how much of an air head I am. she tries to tell me its not my fault but i could've done so many things to avoid it. and I did nothing. I trusted this random guy even when things were weird and now I dont have neither bread Nor piece. 

I constantly feel anxious like someone will come and take advantage of my stupidity again (even though im not doing anything just existing) and no matter how many times I think it will not happen again, i cant help but mourn about the things I should've done. I just wanted to help my mom. no one will accept me in a decent job because im still small (at least in the eyes of the law) but even when I could've helped her I failed her. I feel like I cant do anything right. I try and think it will pass but it doesnt help.

"Do you ever feel a panic attack come on but it doesn’t happen? I have had my share of textbook, explosively-outward panic attacks, but most of the time, I have “silent” panic attacks. Full blown, paralyzing fear internally that can go unnoticed to people around me.

"Post-anxiety health issues 26F pretty much anxious my whole life but definitely more so feeling the health effects from it in my mid 20s. 

As a teen, my anxiety just gave me momentary heart racing, feeling of nervousness. Really just normal sensations.

Now, especially around my cycle, I tend to get manic almost. And my health suffers from it. And if I am happy, it feels so odd. Which increases the feelings of mania. Happiness does not bring me calm, only indifference does. 

When the anxiety passes, I have fatigue, headaches, weakness, weird bodily sensations I can’t quite put my finger on. Indigestion, heart palpitations, dizzy. Blood sugar issues even.

When I am in the middle of my anxiety, I feel very alert, lots of energy, like I can do anything (physically that is). I start getting really anxious about my health, and have not tried medication for those reasons as well. Been to therapy, I understand all my thoughts too well unfortunately.

What changed? Why does my body not tolerate stress anymore? Why is it not used to it when I go through this everyday? And I always seem to crash afterwards or is it something else healthwise? I’m just.. anxious lol I’m actually slowly destroying myself with my own thoughts and by the time I’m 35 I’ll be a goner

"How to relax racing thoughts before bed? Hey.

So, I generally struggle with anxiety, OCD and insomnia. The past 2.5 months my sleep has been a lot better, same for my OCD and anxiety but since the past week, I've started to struggle again. Today specifically was a very stressful OCD day and I was having intrusive thoughts on a massive level all day and I could not deal with them as well as usual.

That's where I'm still at. I'm laying in bed, trying to sleep and distract myself but my mind is not shutting off. I've been trying my coping methods to think about something positive, or distract myself by watching a show and do my usual bedtime routine but I'm still clearly affected by my ongoing anxiety today and now don't know how to shut it off for sleep. 

My sleep anxiety and intrusive thoughts kicked in an hour or so before bed, too, which is why I presume I can't fall asleep right now. It's only 12:30 right now and I don't mind sleeping in longer so I can calm myself down that way but I desperately need my mind to shut up for that.

"Is this a Panic Attack? Background

27, overweight. On 10mg per day of dexamphetamine (ADHD medication). Have been on adhd medication for a month or so. Before starting medication I would smoke marijuana on and off periods. Since starting the ADHD medication, I found giving into my addictive tendencies heavily reduced.

2 nights ago I had a little bit of weed. Had been almost 2 months since last smoking weed  which was a long period for me. Felt good. Went about my night playing some video games. Last night I intended to do the same thing, except I smoked a little more than the previous night. After about 20 minutes I started to feel disassociation. Like I was losing my mind. I went to lay down and bring with my own thoughts laying down just made things worse.
I started to freak out, breathing heavily, heart racing. My heart started to feel like it was going to burst out of my chest. I thought I was dying. I honestly feel like it was the closest I've ever been to death. Started questioning my life, wa so upset and ashamed that this is how I was going. I couldn't bear the thought of leaving my pregnant wife behind.  Felt like my life was flashing before my eyes. Eventually it settled, I calmed down. I was worried I was having a heart attack, and debated calling an ambulance. I convinced myself that how I'm feeling is just amplified due to the weed, so decided to wait it out and think about wtf happened coherently the next morning. 

It is now the next day, about 18 hours since. I still have chest pain but feel like it comes on more when thinking about last night.

I'm scared. Was it a panic attack? I think it was but what if it was a heart attack?  I just feel like my brain is all over the place and don't know what to do.",anxiety

"First timer anxiety / panic attack I would like to go see a doctor - but it’s Saturday morning and my usual GP I go to only opens on Monday. Should I go to a different GP just to get help or should I wait it out to go see a doctor that knows my history? 

A little backstory. I have been suffering with chronic muscle pain for years. (12 years to be accurate) I have seen multiple doctors and specialists regarding this and they’re still trying to pin point what exactly is the matter. Note that I have only actively started looking into/treating the muscle pain for the last 5 years. And I can only afford to see a specialist once a year max so it is a slow progress.

Now these passed three weeks I have been noticing signs of anxiety. Tight chest, numb feeling - which are also symptoms of my chronic muscle pain. Buttt I also started getting really angry and irritated for no reason, I started feeling dizzy all the time and the tight chest felt more like a tight heart than the usual tight chest I get from my chronic pain. 

So last night, my fiancé wanted to go shower, and I switched off the geyser to save electricity. This is a common thing for us to do. He got a little irritated because getting out of a cold shower, even if it’s a common thing for us to do to switch off the geyser, you really hate yourself a bit for not checking if the geyser was on. When I say he got a little irritated, I really mean a LITTLE, his reaction was minor and it completely tipped me over. 

I started with a cramp to the side of my rib cage, which is also common with my chronic pain, however this cramp/spasm felt minor to what I’m usually used to. Shortly after the cramp/spasm my heartbeat started rising and I got even dizzier and a bit more shakier. I immediately started crying and I didn’t understand why I was crying. I started getting irritated for being silly for crying for no reason and then I started to struggle to breath and this set off another sense of panic and overwhelmingness.

A little while after I realised this may be a panic/anxiety attack and I need to calm myself down. I tried getting my breathing under control and I would eventually start breathing fine but still left traumatised. A little after that the breathing situation would flare up again and then I had to try and relax and focus on my breathing. This happened approximately 9-11 times within the next 90minutes or so… I was obviously not concerned about time or keeping a tally during this time. 

I obviously spent a bit of time on google after I managed to stay calm and breath normally again and most articles recommended seeing a doctor to make sure it was in fact and anxiety/panic attack and not some other underlying issue. Now the problem is that I know I have chronic pain and a different GP that’s not familiar with my personality nor my history might request a bunch of tests which could potentially lead to a delayed diagnosis and/or unnecessary expenses (the unnecessary expense part is pretty important for me right now, I mean we’re getting married soon and we’re paying for it ourselves). But also, Monday still feels pretty far away and I’m not even sure if I will get that appointment on Monday - there’s a possibility my doctor may only have an opening Tuesday or Wednesday. So what do I do? And if anyone has any helpful tips please send them this way, I’m scared to go back to that place of pure panic and I still don’t feel 100% comfortable to go by my day. ",anxiety

About 2 years ago I was on vacation with my fiancé’s family and we decided to ride with them to dinner.

"I went from loving my job to hating it So I got a job last year at a retirement home working in their kitchen, and it was a wonderful change of pace from restaurant work. 
All the equipment was in great shape, my manager kept everything sparkly clean, and I was working with two older women, who I got along with pretty well.
One of them had some kind of learning disability and she and I clicked on a way I didn’t with the rest of the staff.
Well, a few months ago my manager left for her vacation which she had been planning for six months and she was out of the country.
Both my coworkers quit the week before her vacation and she had to bring an ex employee back who was an older man, very backwoods blue collar guy who definitely makes an effort to be positive and he is nice to me, but he’s a lot more easily stressed by the lunch rush and sometimes he goes on really bigoted rants out of nowhere.

So my manager left for vacation and it was just me and him alone together for nine days straight. 
During that week, the hurricanes hit the area we’re at pretty hard and we lost running water for three days.
His cousin died in the flood. 
We both continued to show up for work but I could tell he was losing his grip and one day he went off and started screaming at one of the nurses.
I started binging weed just to get through everything and when my manager got back, she seemed totally clueless about the kind of hell we’d been through and asked me about my new girlfriend and I had to remind her that I hadn’t seen her at all in two weeks because I was locked away in that building. 
My manager gave me an extra day off that week to recooperate but ever since then I just hate my job. I don’t wanna look at that kitchen anymore.
My girlfriend left me and I’ve been a depressed anxious wreck.
I got put on SSRIs this week, and I’m getting better but I still fucking hate my job.

I felt this way about my old job after Covid hit and screwed everything up and I was there for four years.
It’s like I associate it forever now with that one really bad week and it feels like every time I clock in I’m reliving it all over again.

"Something I'm trying to put out post-election and after a lot of mental stress personally  Hey! Just remember two things to get you through a post election internet sphere

1: ""Realistic"" doesn't mean ""Certain"", just because scenarios people put forward could happen doesn't mean it's certain they will, and it's usually 100% certain they won't happen exactly as imagined.

2: Misinformation doesn't just come from loons or conmen, your average internet citizen can be just as misled or worried as you, but just manifest it in more direct ""X WILL doubtlessly happen"" mentality.

He lives in a different city from me and we've been talking for some time about me coming to stay with him for a week.

I think I'm worried that he will suddenly disconnect or turn cold or abusive (there's no evidence of this so far in our relationship, but I am a survivor of abuse so I imagine it's residue from my past experience).

"Therapy is not working? Hi there. This is my first time seeing a therapist in person, after jumping around tele / virtual therapy for a couple of years. I’ve been going this therapist for 5 months but I feel I am not making any progress, and feel I am getting worse? What do I do?

I left a stable but stagnant job I had for 7 years at the beginning of the year. Got rid of my apartment, went to a new city to take a chance on a role potentially . However it was bait and switch and didn’t work out. I was essentially humiliated on the way out despite all the positives I accomplished. 

Now I am stuck somewhere where I don’t want to be with no friends, stuck in my families house helping their family business that brings me no joy or is challenging myself. Trying my best to rebuild my finances. I’ve never dated and incredibly lonely, but no making any progress there. 

I’m not getting tangible next steps from my therapist. Everytime I go in to the session I feel like I am going though a LinkedIn Job page with him, and not actually getting better.

What do I do?",anxiety

"Im lost So heres the thing.

Over the last couple of months, i've been fired from a job, misdiagnosed with High blood pressure, anxiety and a week ago my granphather die.

It all started in July, when they fired me from my job, because they couldn't relocate me to another place. And after a month my anxiety attacks and accumulated stress began, i went to the doctor and he told me i had hypertension. I Quit smoking cigarettes (after more than 10 years of smoking), quit soda and salt all together)

I spent 2 months taking Enalapril without feeling any physical improvement, but my blood pressure was always perfect. My aunt and uncle, who are hypertensive, told me to stop taking it because it was lowering my blood pressure too much.

I realized that it was not Hypertension and that it was stress. To all this, I have had shoulder pain for more than two months, I don't know if it is due to anxiety or because I sleep poorly. And honestly im so tired of feeling this pain, i really dont know what it is. And im so scared of going to the doctors.

After that, my grandfather had a stroke and I had to take care of him alone since my entire family was out of the country he sadly passed away 5 days latter

Now I have become more anxious than ever, I am afraid of dying, I am afraid of everything. I'm afraid to go out into the streets and feel like I'm going to die right there.

Any pain I have I feel like it's because I'm going to die, I'm tired of thinking like that.

Im having palpitations every night and everything is getting worse, you know?

Can you give a suggestion?

"Put on meds without being told they’re beta blockers?! I was diagnosed with anxiety early this year, I was shocked at the diagnosis but after research, I feel like I finally have an answer to A LOT.

My panic attacks and chest pains (what I thought were heart attacks) were the main problem as well as my overstimulation and constantly thinking the worst. 

I have a history with adverse effects on medication and therefore I am always reluctant to take them. When my doctor told me that she had meds to help I naturally had many questions.

The first was whether they would affect my brain chemistry as I didn’t want to feel “numb” and these tablets didn’t. They were sold to me as a dream, they only target physical effects or anxiety i.e. they help with chest tightness and generally calm me down. When I asked potential side effects, I was told “they may cause some stomach upset but that’s it”. Backstory, I have PCOS and suspected endo which causes me to suffer everyday with stomach pains which we still haven’t gotten to the bottom of. So why the doctor thought these tablets were good for me based off my records, I have zero idea. However, I was willing to take the risk and compared to other meds, these seemed a dream.

I was told take them once a day and don’t stop them until you’ve consulted a GP and you’re good to go. After a week, I was suffering even worse with my chest tightness and overall mental stability so I checked the leaflet inside the packaging (I know I should have done this before) and found that these were in fact beta blockers. Since, I have tried contacting the GP so I know I can safely get off these meds but I cannot get through to them for the life of me. 

Bottom line, I’m stuck on this medication that I wasn’t properly informed about and it’s put me in a state of mania and psychosis, not to mention worsening my symptoms. I have filed a complaint with the GP about this and other negligent actions but is this as bad as I think it is?? I know this is a lot but I wanted to give a back story so it’s understood:) 

Any help or advice is appreciated x",anxiety

However, for the last year I’ve had more “sleeping episodes.” In the morning, which I’ve now realized is usually close to when I take the medicine, I’ve started falling asleep no matter what I’m doing.

"Does it ever get better ? I am a 20F and I'll turn 21 in 3 weeks. I have been pretty anxious for a few years now, but I knew how to manage it. I even studied abroad for 2 years when I was 17 and I loved this part of my life. When I came back home to pursue my studies, it felt a bit strange but I kept it together and had a pretty full social life. Then I turned 20 and my life became hell. First I started having insomnia, then I just started throwing up randomly and feeling nauseous all the time. My thoughts were eating me alive and I could not tell anyone about it. That's when my panic attacks started. It was almost everyday before going to uni. Nonetheless, my life was perfect on paper. I am a sociable and conventionally attractive woman who just graduated from my country's best university. So I kept pretending for a few months that everything was okay and started obsessing over fitness to the point where I lost a lot of weight. I felt palpitations continuously and could not eat without feeling like I was going to choke on my food. I would feel hot all the time and start sweating excessively, which never happened to me before. I was a complete mess and could not face my reflection in the mirror, but nobody knew. I spent the summer doing all these medical tests to find an answer, then I faced the truth last month and went to see a psychiatrist. I got diagnosed with GAD, PTSD and OCD. I take 100mg of sertraline everyday, it's been 4 weeks now. I don't know how I got there. I used to be a perfectionist and a true workaholic. I was not scared of anything and always felt like I was special. Now I just feel like a waste of potential and a burden. I am screwing everything's up and I am relying on medication to stay alive. If there was a magic pill to come back to who I was a few years ago I would take it, but I know that's not possible. I can't even go out or take public transportation without feeling threatened by others. I kinda figured out how I got there, people were harsh with me for years because they thought I ""could take it"". Well, turns out I can't anymore. The thing is, I don't know how to get out of that place, and it's killing me. It's such a pity for me to say that my physical appearance is the only thing I have left, and I keep thinking about how it will one day fade away and how lonely I'll be. Maybe it's the side effects of my medication making my anxiety worse for a while, but I really don't want to turn 21 with such little hope for the future. No one around me seems to understand what anxiety is really like, so I guess I wanted to reach out to people who might understand my situation or who have had similar experiences in the past. Is there any chance for me to get better ? Is there anything I can do besides taking pills and hoping for the best ? ",anxiety

"Recovery after breakdown Had a really awful depression relapse post US election results and after a few days I decided to scrape myself out of bed and do some chores and move my body. I currently live alone with my dog and truly love the solitude it provides. No I don’t have any friends because I struggle at maintaining relationships and I am perfectly okay with being alone. 

The problem lies when I have to leave my quiet safe environment and enter the busy bustling world where everyone  is in a hurry to be somewhere and have very little patience for others. The world quite literally feels unsafe (and by world I mean just everywhere OUTSIDE my apartment). 

It requires a lot of energy to remain calm in those moments where all I want to do is scream and run out of the grocery store. The grocery store; where to normal people is just another errand in their everlasting to do list. But me? The grocery store is a big deal and once I get home I celebrate going even if it requires taking the rest of the day to recover.

"I need help with palpitations and anxiety I am 21 years old and I made a stupid mistake. I swallowed a 100mg Viagra pill for the sake of experimentation. At first, the symptoms that appeared to me were a headache and I started seeing blue and green colors and my heart started beating rapidly. The symptoms lasted for two hours and I did not ejaculate. At that moment, I had a scary feeling. I felt that the left side of my body started to tingle or feel like chills and I felt that my soul was coming out of my body. I do not know if this was a case of fainting or death or high blood pressure. I went to the hospital immediately. They measured my heart. I had palpitations and my blood pressure was high and they gave me heart palpitations pills. When I took them, I felt better, but the next day the heart palpitations returned and I became more anxious and afraid for no reason, especially when I went to sleep. I went to the cardiologist and he put a holter device on my body for a whole day and took a blood test and my vitamin D level was 8. I do not know if this was the reason. After that, the holter device was checked. My pulse was 164 beats when exerted and 43 beats when relaxed. Then he gave me pills.  For the heart, including vitamin D 50,000, I started taking pills and the situation was getting worse. The anxiety and fear increased for no reason, as well as depression, and I had a feeling that I was dying. I was crushed from the inside, and the thinking, fear, and obsessions increased. Then I stopped the medications that the doctor gave me, called (ivadin), except for vitamin D 50,000. I am still taking vitamin D. It has been 3 weeks since I took vitamin D weekly.

"I've never been anywhere more scary than my local walmart Sorry, this might be a long post,, but I really need advice. I have had alot of anxiety issues about our walmart. Let me give some context-
I have always had anxiety over walmart ever since I was a little kid. When I was about 6, my grandma made my older cousin and I go to the back to get something, as we were walking, a man flew around one of those shorter square shelfs, and hit me with his buggy so hard that the corner of the shelf stabbed into my side, he ran away and didn't apologize as I was gushing blood out of my hip. I still have a scar from it. 
So now I'm 25- I still unfortunately have to go to the same exact walmart and I feel like it's only worse... 
-We live in a city of 35,000 people
-Walmart is the most affordable grocery store in town (besides HEB, I live in Texas, but HEB is in an even SMALLER building  than walmart, and twice as packed because of the good deals)
-this walmart not only has our whole towns population at times, it has everyone who is traveling the major state highway that is right in front of it, and people who are from smaller towns like 20 mins away. 
- we live in a retirement city, there are alot of older people on electric scooters and alot of families who come in together and it makes it really hard to get around. 
-everything is always out of stock and I feel like the grocery pickup has alot to do with it (and also contributes to the crowds when they push around their ginormous carts) 

When I turned 18- before pandemic times, I had no problem with shopping in the middle of the night because at least thats an option for people who don't like crowds. Now that walmart isn't 24 hours anymore, my best bet is going at 6am, which isn't possible anymore because my boyfriend and I are sharing a car and he gets off at prime time, 5:30 pm and unfortunately, he hates it as much as I do, so we end up sprinting out of there with barely anything.

 We have used the grocery pick up before, but it's really frustrating when we plan out a meal and it's out of stock and they replace it with something that doesn't work for our recipe, or they just entirely mess up or order, causing us to have to go inside to fix it. 

I'm not delusional when I say they are so busy, I've looked up reviews for our walmart and others say it's so crowded or the layout is bad. Please any advice that can help me get through this. A walmart shouldn't be making me want to pack everything and leave this town because it's my only option to shop at, but it is because it's affecting my everyday life and I'm tired of being hungry because I don't have the strength to push through in there.

When I try and talk to people about it they always point out how other people have it worse than me. I know that, and it makes me feel like I'm pathetic or weak. 

I'm not sure how to explain to people that haven't had anxiety or a panic attack what it's actually like. I'm exhausted, and don't know what to do. 

How do I explain how I feel?",anxiety
"Constant fight or fight mode due to finances I (F28) have been in a constant state of anxiety and panic due to the state of my finances. Like a pressure headache, buzzing in my head, dizziness, light sensitivity, shortness of breath, full-blown panic attacks.

I literally only have $200 in my bank account. I need to save at least $1,900 by the end of the month to pay the mortgage and HOA. I only make about $800 every two weeks from my usual job after health insurance and taxes. On top of that, I have to take multiple days off a month because of severe anxiety. I supplement my income with freelance work online, but sometimes I only have enough work to make $100 a week. Then Christmas is coming up, and I have to save around $400 for that just to get my family decent gifts and bring a few dishes to upcoming parties. Then 5 family birthdays are coming up from now until early January so that's around $20 minimum per gift for money I really don't have.

Ugh, I'm just so overwhelmed. I get anxious about my finances, then I get so sick from anxiety that I have to call into work. It's a huge endless cycle. :(",anxiety

"Does anyone else feel like talk therapy has gone way downhill over the last 10+ years? Or is it just me? I feel like when I was in my early 20’s, therapy was a much different experience. Therapists seemed way better at their jobs than they do now. 

I would have sessions that seemed to be “threaded” together better.. we picked up where we left off.. therapists seemed better at digging deeper. Idk.

I’ve been noticing lately that those things are harder to come by. I have cycled through so many therapists over the last six years because I’ve noticed that we were just shooting the shit.

I’d open up about some pretty big things in previous sessions and in the following session, it’s like I never said it. 

I feel like I’m doing A LOT of work to start and steer the conversations and give them something to talk about. I get that in the beginning, I have to do that but after 3-4 sessions, meet me halfway!

Also.. I do WEEKLY sessions.

And yes, I am very upfront with therapists in the first session.. I explain what I’d like to work on specifically and what my pain points have been with therapy lately. 

Idk, it’s just really discouraging when I really want to do the work and build on my sessions but oftentimes I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall. 

I’m about five sessions in with my new therapist and she’s a hoot but she’s very unprofessional.. late, too chatty about her business and other peoples business, minding her phone during our sessions, and I’m prettyyyyy sure she’s a little high lol (not funny but wtf).

I’m gonna keep the faith and keep searching (I’ve tried different platforms, private practices, services through my employer, etc). 

Anyone else notice this lately??? Do you feel like therapy was a little more helpful and effective in the past?

TLDR: therapy has been shit lately. Can you relate?

"how do you cope with family worrying about you for your mental health? i have had an intense anxiety flare up a little over two months ago. i have suffered from anxiety since i was little due to childhood trauma, but during my teenage years and until this year it was definitely manageable and i was able to do pretty much everything. 


it seems a panic attack after not having one in a while triggered my anxiety and took me to a state where my anxiety, for the past couple of months, has started to become almost debilitating. i can’t do any of the things i did easily before because i am followed by this anxiety cloud over my head at all times.


one thing that has been bothering me is how i see the people close to me reacting to this, especially my family. i honestly feel terrible because i can see my close family being worried about me because they see i’m struggling. i suffer from pretty bad panic attacks and my dad has seen me numerous times while having a panic attack and i know he’s worried. i started taking lexapro about a month ago but my mood still is very up and down and i have days where i feel okay and others where i get a panic attack and then cry for two hours because it feels like i will never be okay again. they haven’t seen me in a state like this since i had just experienced my childhood trauma.


what i want to ask is: how do i cope seeing the people i love suffering because they see me suffer? how do i reassure them that i’ll be okay when sometimes i can’t even believe it myself?",anxiety
Driving with my friend for the first time  I got my license a little late (19 years old) and I’ve had it for 2 months. I haven’t gone many places and I haven’t driven with many people. Today my best friend wants me to drive us to get breakfast and I’m honestly anxious. Driving to new places stresses me out and I’ve never driven her anywhere because driving with her seems so scary to me. I think I don’t want to be judged if I make a mistake like driving the wrong way. Because she got her license at 16 and has much more experience driving. I’m also horrible with directions and will probably need to have google maps up. While she has a great sense of direction and can always figure out how to get somewhere.

"Therapists validating anxiety/intrusive thoughts Hiya,

I've been through a fair amount of therapists throughout my life and I haven't been able to find a therapist or style that fully clicks. I saw a comment on /r/AskReddit the other day about having OCD and ensuring therapists do not validate the anxieties/thoughts from OCD. 

I was thinking about this and I recall a therapist I had several years ago. I told her that I had some anxiety about eating in a restaurant alone, especially sitting in a booth and seeing the empty chair across from me. She told me that if it were her, she would have booked it out of the restaurant immediately. 

I think her goal was to validate my feelings about being nervous but reflecting on this, I have not been able to eat alone since then. What she said affirmed in my mind that my anxieties about eating alone were justified. 

I can't recall too many other examples but I've seen a couple of other therapists after her and I must have shared similar anxieties about other situations. 

I don't want this to say I am pointing the blame at these therapists, these anxieties are my own and my own to deal with. But I do wonder if these therapists have worsened these fears? If they were maybe at a 5/10 on the anxiety scale, talking to these therapists and having these fears justified bumped them to a 7/10. 

I apologize for the wall of text. I've just never been able to really reap benefits from therapy and I'm starting to wonder if I need to seek out a therapist specialized in OCD just based off that /r/AskReddit comment. I do have some OCD tendencies - obsessing about locked doors, the oven, the placement of objects. I am just now starting to question if these OCD tendencies extend into my general anxieties.

Does anyone else relate? Any thoughts?",anxiety

"How to feel euphoric without things getting too risky? I started taking Prozac about 5 months ago, and Buspirone two months ago. At the moment, I’m prescribed 30mg of Prozac, and 7.5mg of Buspirone. 

I recently bought tickets to a EDM show, fully expecting to partake in party supplements. I’ve done MDMA once (before being prescribed anti-depressants) and it was magical. I’ve always had a really hard time loosening up and getting out of my head in large groups, so it was such a transformative experience for me.

After doing some research though, I’ve realized that now that I’m taking these meds, rolling might be either a dull or risky experience. I know the combo of Prozac and Buspar already has a super low chance of serotonin syndrome, so the idea of taking MDMA or something like it is tripping me out even more. My meds haven’t exactly helped me in the category of loosening up in big groups, so I’m worried that I’ll be in my head the whole time and not have fun.

* If possible, party supplements that aren’t too risky to take with Prozac + Buspirone, or maybe ways to regulate it?

"Need Advice | Appetite!  During certain social situations (most of which are unpredictable) I lose the ability to eat food entirely, any attempt to do so makes me incredibly nauseous and can even lead to vomiting. Sometimes, when I'm on holiday or in certain situations with friends I would starve for long periods, as regardless of how hungry I am I cannot eat, only surviving off liquids.

"Eye ! Question  Why does putting pressure on your eyes (leaning on them as an example) cause your eyes to go blurry? I notice if I lean on one of my eyes then try to focus my vision on my nose! It’s fuzzy. 

If I cover one of my eyes it’s fine, no problem but if I put pressure on one of my eyes, then squint with the remaining eye or try to look at my nose with one eye covered, that after a while my vision can go abit fuzzy/grainy/static/blurry! 

Don’t ask me how I discovered this haha I think it must have been whilst sleeping and reaching for my phone to check the time, I sleep on my side with my head deep in the pillow and had one eye closed pressed against the pillow and one eye squinting for bright light and was looking at my phone and noticed my vision was grainy/ static/ fuzzy until I removed the pressure from my eye and stopped squinting !

"Seeking Advice: Managing Xanax Withdrawal, Anxiety, and Building a Healthy Routine 
Hey everyone,

I’m going through a rough patch and could really use some advice from people who’ve been through something similar. I’ve been dealing with generalized anxiety and, for the past week or so, found myself relying pretty heavily on Xanax (6-10 mg daily). Unfortunately, I ran out yesterday, and since I’m on a work assignment at a mine with no access to medical help, I’m going cold turkey. I’d really appreciate any advice on managing this situation, especially if anyone’s done a sudden stop with benzos.

My Plan for the Next Few Days:

I’ve done some quick research and put together a plan to help manage the symptoms. I’m trying to keep things simple and manageable. Here’s what I’m doing:

	•	Basic Supplements:
	•	Vitamin B Complex in the morning (to support the nervous system).
	•	Vitamin C in the morning (helps with stress).
	•	Magnesium in the evening to help with sleep.
	•	Ashwagandha (KSM-66):
	•	Morning dose with breakfast for anxiety.
	•	Optional evening dose to help me wind down at night if I need it.
	•	Daily Routine:
	•	I’m trying to stay active with a morning workout or light exercise to keep my mind occupied.
	•	At night, I’m focusing on relaxation with a bit of meditation and the magnesium.
	•	No alcohol, staying hydrated, and keeping meals simple.

I know this isn’t a magic fix, but I’m hoping these small steps will keep me grounded.

Looking for Tips & Experiences:

If anyone’s gone through something similar, I’d love to hear what helped you. Any tips for handling the anxiety and insomnia, or just staying steady? I’m looking forward to getting past this, but it’s tough right now. Thanks in advance to anyone who can share their insights.",anxiety
"Afraid I have some horrible disease? I used to smoke weed and drink caffeine and eat sugar before bed every night and started dealing with headaches and high blood pressure.

"I read a medical article—and passed out Fainting is a common experience. It seems that between a third and two-fifths of the population faint at least once during their lives. Some people’s lives are blighted by frequent fainting episodes. I’m lucky by comparison: I’ve only fainted once (and had one near-miss). It happened long ago. But it’s an incident that stands out in my life, because it came as a shock, and triggered painful emotions. So perhaps it may be worth recording here.

As a child and adolescent, I had strong tendencies to both squeamishness and health anxiety. I was particularly afraid of the idea of fainting. I thought it would be embarrassing, even humiliating to faint. There were certain experiences, I knew, that might trigger and reveal my sensitivities. I put up defences against them. I managed to give up studying biology before I had to do dissections. I avoided certain films, like The Exorcist, that were regarded as horrific: if people in the cinema were fainting, I would not be one of them. But I also didn’t want my mother to be aware of my sensitivity or of any trait that might be classed as weakness or unmanliness.

I got through to my eighteenth year without ever fainting, without ever coming close. And then it happened…

It was a quiet evening at home. I was sitting in an armchair, reading a magazine. My mother was sitting opposite.

I came to an article about heart attacks. There were interviews with celebrity victims, descriptions, diagrams. References to pains in the chest bulked large. I never finished the article. Part of the way through, I fainted.

At the time, I didn’t actually know what was going on. It was just that as I read my own sensations started to overwhelm me. I seemed to be experiencing what I was reading about. I felt a horrible pressure in my own chest, I broke into a sweat. Sleepiness, a nasty sickly kind of sleepiness  came over me, as if I’d been drugged. I couldn’t fight it; I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was frightened. I wondered if I was having a heart attack. I felt my eyes closing, against my will. I lost consciousness.

My eyes opened. I was still in my chair. Sweaty, weak, confused, still a bit frightened. The fear subsided: whatever had happened,  it seemed  to be over. I didn’t know I had lost consciousness; I thought that perhaps I had just closed my eyes for a second, like you do when you’re tired. But my mother was looking intently at me. She told me I had fainted.

I think I tried to deny it: surely I’d know if I’d fainted. But she was very clear that that’s what had happened.

Somehow it was worse to be told I had fainted than to realize it for myself. And the thought I had fainted in front of my mother was painful; it seemed to bring back childhood vulnerabilities. But that wasn’t all: she asked me why it had happened, and I had to confess that I’d been overcome by reading a medical article in a magazine. It seemed such a pathetic reason. I felt I had lost face. I was not simply embarrassed but ashamed of myself, as if the incident revealed a fundamental weakness. I suppose there must be some personality trait that caused me to faint when another person would not have done: squeamishness? high sensitivity? empathy? anxiety? I don’t know.  What I do know is that I became angry with myself, as if that would get rid of the feeling of shame.

Memory and forgetting are remarkable things. As time passed, and I acquired more experiences, I managed to forget what had happened. It didn’t seem to be connected with the rest of my life. The remembrance came back years later when I was waiting to be put to sleep for surgery and the doctor asked me, among other things, if I had ever fainted. At first I said no. Then I remembered…

As I said, this event stands out as an isolated episode in my life, and yet it also seems to be one of those experiences that reveal you to yourself. As I recall it now, I remember the intensity of the sensations I felt before losing consciousness and of the emotions I felt when I regained it. Except for the brief period of unconsciousness, I was in a way very much alive. That’s why in a way, though I hated it at the time, I’m grateful to have had this brief encounter with fainting. And I feel a kind of solidarity with other people who have had the experience. Whether you have or not, thank you if you have read this far.",anxiety

"Do I have emetophobia? Hi everyone, I would really appreciate if you could read or skim this and help me out a bit.

The past couple of years have been rough on my mental health and I couldn’t figure out the cause. 

It all started when I had a bad hangover for the first time ever (mind you I never really drank so it was new to me) as I was on a train. I felt like I had to throw up for 2 hours straight, and there was nothing I could do about it. I was panicking and my anxiety was to the roof. 

A few days later I started having random panic attacks and I would start shaking and every time I tried to think of something happy or positive, it just didn’t work. So now I was depressed because of that, I mean nothing really brought me the same joy as it did before.

Fast forward a bit and it started to get kind of better, I didn’t drink or do anything to make me feel like I did on the train.

It’s been 1.5 years since the train and things have been all right (not terrible but not the same level of happiness before). All until I threw up, and this was not because of alcohol. 

Exactly one month ago from writing this post, I went to the gym and went past my limits and I also ate some granola and potentially expired milk, I don’t remember. All I remember is the horrifying feeling of “oh god im gonna throw up” and it you just knew there was no stopping it. The uncomfortable feeling of choking while my stomach acid is burning in addition to the severe panic made me almost faint. I had to slowly lay flat on the ground to calm down.

Now within the month after this happened, I have felt so mentally low with many panic attacks where I shake uncontrollably and essentially don’t see a clear future as bad as that sounds. I mean if this is what life is going to be then what is the point.

I am constantly doing everything in my power to not ever feeling like I did a month ago, because that was hell.

I am scared nothing will work to help this but I want to be back to my normal self. I was so happy and enjoyed life, and now I can’t enjoy anything without worrying. 

To conclude this, from anyone’s experience, do I have emetophobia? And whether I do or not, can this get better to the point where I can enjoy life again?

Additional notes: I am currently seeing a psychiatrist but he doesn’t know about this whole throwing up thing yet, and I will not ever consider suicide, but I would give anything in the world to make this better.",anxiety

"Rabies anxiety  I’m sure we’ve all had it at some point - rabies anxiety. Such a weird thing to be overly anxious about since it’s so rare but I’m one of those people that obsesses a little with it and I need some comfort. 

Yesterday on a walk, a loose chihuahua mix cornered me and bit my leg. Their house was nearby as I saw the owners outside calling them and the dogs ran back. I went to the house and asked the couple for rabies paperwork. They were an older couple and said they are their dogs but their daughter takes care of all of that. They contact daughter who has the vet send her their rabies info and she sends it to me.

The date on the paperwork is 11/6/2023. Granted, the bite happened on 11/7/2024. My question was is the paperwork date the expiry or the date given? So I call the vet.

The vet says yes, it expired 11/6/2024. One day before the bite. If you want to get technical, like 10 hours before the bite. So I verify, “okay, so he got a one year rabies vaccine?”
Vet says “no, he got a 3 year, but we always recommend a one year.” (I’m in Texas just fyi) 

I ask “so if we are going to be technical, based on what you just said, the dog is current on his rabies vaccine?” And she says yes. 

So why is my anxiety still up in arms? The dogs rabies was “expired” for ONE DAY. 10 HOURS. I know in my head rabies vaccines just don’t go poof and they are just severely susceptible. Even so, if the dog had bit me 11 hours before and it was current, how much of a difference would that have made? Does anyone see where I’m going with this? 

So, what’s your thoughts? Is this something that I should be panicking over, seeing as I got verification? Is this my anxiety (rabies being my number one fear, if I’m being real) making me insane? ",anxiety

"Anxiety  I've been diagnosed with anxiety back in 2017 and have been on multiple meds and some work for awhile then it gets bad again, I finally saw a therapist and she said even though she's no dr she thinks I don't need meds I need to alter my lifestyle. I also seen two physiatrist who only do med management and both want me on meds. I don't have constant anxiety I can go 6-7 months without ever having a panick attack but when I get overwhelmed and stress I have one really bad month where I get panick attacks frequently and then it starts to die down about 3 weeks for having the attacks. I stopped my old meds per the psychiatrist request because they were prescribed by my pcp, they were antidepressants and I have no signs of depression. And I've been off meds for two weeks and I feel better and haven't had any anxiety in 3 weeks. So do I really need to be on meds daily if they doesn't happen daily. The second psychiatrist who I preferred over the first had better knowledge and understanding even though she only does med management. I asked her will I need to be on meds forever she said no we need to treat it now and once we know the meds work we can go to an as needed basis but if I start meds now when I'm not having anxiety or panic attacks how will I know it's working. I'm just so up in the air about this. Any suggestions or comments are appreciated.",anxiety
"Need help- topic : fleas  Hello! I work in property management and found myself in an apartment yesterday that unknowingly had fleas in it.

I got home and changed my clothes in the garage and left them there. I found quite a few bites on my ankles and have been freaking out that I brought them home with me.

"Panic attack while at therapy  So I’ve been seeing this therapist for about 4 or 5 weeks now, he is so knowledgeable and a brilliant therapist. I get very anxious about having a panic attack (which often brings it on) however I usually tell myself it will never actually happen. Today it did and it sucks.

My therapist helped me deal with it well, I like to be alone when I have a panic attack because I don’t like pressure from other people, he left me alone and helped to distract me. 

Half of me is glad this happened because now I’ve had my worst fear happen to me, and it wasn’t all that bad, I survived. The other half of me is now telling me I shouldn’t go back there, and I’m also really anxious for my next session incase the same thing happens again. 

I’m now left feeling empty and down for the rest of the day because of this panic attack.

"Panic disorder, medication (and insight practice/nonduality) Hi all,

I've suffered from generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks and derealization for years. It comes in episodes, and I recently just went through one of the worst episodes of my life, lasting for a few weeks. I've never used medication before, but finally broke down and saw a psychiatrist during this recent episode and got prescribed some meds. 

The panic attacks are characterized by this intense feeling of being ""trapped inside of reality"". I have no way to describe it other than that. In the past I'd have a panic attack, but then be able to sort of get back to living life and forget about it. The problem during this most recent episode was that the idea of reality itself became a trigger - ""I am always inside reality, which means I am always trapped"". I know this may be incomprehensible to most people, but these thoughts and panic attacks induced real shifts in perception (derealization) where I perceive in my direct experience that I am literally trapped inside 3D space in the present moment. I am trapped inside experience itself. So for about 2 weeks I was in a state where I felt trapped like 24/7. Couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, constantly either panicking, in constant anxiety, or ruminating/obsessing over these thoughts and my direct experience of being a being/consciousness who is inside of experience. 

The psychiatrist prescribed me mirtazapine, prozac and propranolol. At this point I've had 6 nights of mirtazapine (15 mg) and today was my second morning of prozac (10 mg). I've taken propranolol only twice and don't plan to take it for daily use unless needed. 

3 days ago I felt okay, yesterday I felt decent for much of the day, and today I'm feeling ""normal"" in a way I haven't felt in a long time. Reality itself doesn't feel threatening, and the thought about ""being inside reality"" that was triggering panic is not doing so.

I should also add that I'm very into meditation, Buddhism and exploration of direct experience, so all during this episode I was practicing all kinds of insight practices to explore my experience and see how suffering was being created. At times it felt like there were minor epiphanies that led to a momentary release of suffering, but I kept finding myself back at that place of being ""trapped inside reality"". 

My questions:

1) I'd like to believe that my recent comedown was due to progress I'd made by studying my direct experience, but if I'm honest that is probably wishful thinking. It's probably the meds. But which one is working? As I said above, I've only been on mirtazapine for 6 days (nightly) and this is only my second morning of prozac. But today is the first day where I feel ""normal"". I don't feel high, I feel just completely grounded and normal. Could it be that the mirtazapine is helping, or maybe even the Prozac is already hitting on day 2? I've heard these meds can take weeks to take effect. To have something work on day 2 seems highly unlikely. Yet I feel so grounded and normal today. 

The following questions are more for those who are into meditation, spirituality, studying direct experience.

2) How do you reconcile your struggles with anxiety/panic disorders with your desire to walk the path? I'm left feeling a bit defeated - the states of suffering I went through were unbearable, even though I did my best to practice equanimity and acceptance. I feel defeated that I have to use medication and was unable to 'overcome' these states on my own. Further, I'm a big believer in studying direct experience to understand the truth of reality and how we create our suffering. Yet how can I reconcile the validity of studying direct experience with these states of strong derealization where I'm perceiving reality to be a certain way (i.e. that I am trapped)? During the episode I searched everywhere for a self who was trapped but couldn't find him. Yet it still felt like there was an ""I"" somewhere in experience who was trapped. 

3) Finally, how am I supposed to move forward with this knowledge I have? This knowledge that there is indeed some truth to the idea that I am a part of reality. In a way, that is true. Right now, it is not a threat. But clearly it has been/can be a trigger that can make my life miserable. And yet it's still true. I'm beginning therapy next week with a nondual therapist, and am hoping I can make some progress on my integration of this basic fact of life that I have been unable to integrate for over a decade and a half. Will I be forever dependent upon medication to keep me from panicking at this basic fact of life? 

4) Can anyone relate to this? This perception/trigger of being part of/inside of reality? I know it sounds bizarre, but it was my direct experience. Anyone else who is walking the path care to share their experience?",anxiety

"I need help badly My mind and body fail me every time. 

I don’t even know where to begin. My anxiety has gotten pretty bad lately. It acts up a lot at work. I work at a big restaurant with a lot of employees. I feel like there is a lot of pressure to be social, outgoing, and talkative. I also have a crush on one of the servers so I’ve been putting more pressure on myself to talk to her. My roommate knows about her so she’s egging me on too. 

Today it felt like my body was gonna shut down at any moment. It was like I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. My mind would not stop racing with thoughts. I tried to calm myself down, but I simply couldn’t. I couldn’t rationalize anything. I couldn’t simplify the way I was feeling. It felt like the weight of the world was on my shoulders tonight. I cannot understand why. 

Maybe it’s because everything feels like my fault. My shyness, awkwardness, avoidance, and anxiety is because I am doing something wrong. But I can’t figure out what it is. I don’t feel like any of this is by choice. It’s as if something possesses me when I’m around other people.

"Struggling with Anxiety for 6+ Years—Looking for Advice on How to Move Forward Hey Reddit,

I’ve been dealing with anxiety and agoraphobia for over six years now, and over the past three years, it’s gotten much harder to handle. I’ve made some progress here and there, but it always feels like something knocks me back, and I end up feeling stuck.

A little about me:

* I’m 24 and have struggled with anxiety since I was younger. It’s made daily things like leaving the house or talking to people tough. I’ve been working on it, but the progress doesn’t always stick, and it’s discouraging to feel like I’m back at square one after every setback.
* I live on my own and rely on HelloFresh and Amazon for food and essentials since I can’t go to the store. My family is nearby, but I feel like I’m a bit of a burden to them. They've been supportive, but I worry they’ve given up after so many years of me being stuck in this cycle.
* 3D modeling is something I really enjoy, and I’ve even sold 3D assets before and done some 2D art commissions, but confidence is a huge barrier for me. I struggle with promoting my services and setting fair prices, which makes it harder to make consistent money or grow. I love the work I do, but my anxiety makes it hard to stay motivated and to know where to start when it comes to marketing myself or finding new clients.

What I’m looking for is advice on how to move forward. I don’t know how to get a job or build qualifications, especially since I don’t have the money for courses. I also want to find a way to make enough money to stop relying on government aid, but I’m not sure how to break through. I just feel a bit aimless sometimes, especially with the anxiety holding me back from pushing myself forward.

What has helped you guys get through your anxiety?

If anyone has advice on overcoming this confidence struggle, or how to take small steps toward being more independent (both financially and emotionally), I’d really appreciate it. I just want to find a way to make progress and build something for myself, even if it’s slow.

"Had to report a coworker and now worried  I had to report my co worker today. We work with small children (babies really) and the way she speaks to them is very upsetting. Check my post history if you’re interested in the story. I considered doing it anonymously but decided it was better to do so in person so they could ask questions and get the full story. Things started happening immediately. They promised everything would be confidential but I am soooo worried it’s going to come back to me. I was in the office for awhile this morning discussing it but they told them we were going of certifications. I trust my team better than to treat me differently if they find out but they’ve been watching her treat the kids like this for awhile so my faith is a little shaken there. It might also come down on my lead teacher because she has failed to do anything about it or report it. 

I’m also worried that if this teacher finds out it was me, she would throw me under the bus due to the mental health struggles I’ve had that we’ve spoken lightly about. 

I feel bad because I might affect her livelihood but the kids come first. I think I did the right thing but I am sooooo freaking scared right now. Tensions are already so high today. My team was losing it and then they took that teacher out and put her in another room which probably helped with less yelling but also knocked us down a set of hands. 

I’ve never had a career like this, I’ve never had to report someone before. I just want what’s best for the kids. ",anxiety

"When health anxiety because real  I know I post a lot and I’m sorry if people find that annoying but I’m really struggling at the minute to function. 

I’ve been suffering with a wide range of symptoms for a while now that have been put down to anxiety and TMJ (from clenching my teeth in my sleep), but they do feel like they’ve ramped up lately. 

I ended up booking a private consultation with an ENT to see if there were any treatment options. However, he didn’t even mention TMJ. He said some of my symptoms were concerning and sounded more related to neurological nerves. 

He’s referred me for a Brain and inner ear MRI. 

It’s not until the 25th of this month and all I can do now is sit and panic that I really do have a brain tumor or something really is actually wrong and that I’ve been right after all. 

I’m having my MRI in an open and upright scanner so I don’t have to worry about being claustrophobic or anything at least. 

Has any one had experience with being referred for scary tests but it ultimately turning out just fine? 

Symptoms are 

- dizziness / lightheaded
- Spacey feeling / brain fog 
- Eyes struggle to focus / want to cross over 
- Neck stiffness / tightness 
- Tight when turning head
- Increased anxiety 
- Tinnitus
- Sometimes headaches 
- Strange smells

"Why can’t I handle weed?? Whenever I get high and enter and social environment, I lose the ability to interact with others and make a complete idiot of myself. My jaw tightens up, I start speaking quietly and I lose all social skills (ex. speaking out of turn, lack of awareness of surroundings, etc.) It increases my insecurity so much and makes me not want to be around other people at all. 

Because of this, I prefer to only get high by myself or with 1-2 other people. When I get high, all I want to do is observe my own thoughts and just chill by myself and do my own thing. 

It’s just annoying because my friends say they become MORE social when they’re high, which I don’t understand at all. 

When I smoke with friends, they seem to act completely normal, like it isn’t affecting them as much as it is me. It’s not like they’re addicts or anything, they just seem to chill out more when they’re high. 

The only way I’ve been able to overcome it is by getting crossed, but obviously that isn’t very sustainable or practical for when I wanna smoke with others. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE getting high alone, but it would be nice to how to handle myself around others. Any advice??",anxiety

"How can I support someone who refuses to face their anxiety? My husband is suffering from anxiety and has been for years (I suspect for even longer than I’ve known him) and it’s only getting worse and worse. 

He will admit he has anxiety in the midst of a panic attack but once it’s over he goes back to admitting he has it but refusing to do anything about it. His GP prescribed him medication but he has really bad health anxiety and has trouble taking advil or tums, never mind prescriptions.

I don’t want to push him, I want him to want to get better but I see the toll it’s taking on him and I’m really worried for his health. He focuses on exercise to feel better and often times will go to the gym and then cycle 100km in the same day, and when its raining or the gym is closed he has a lot of trouble dealing with that.  Exercise is healthy but this is beyond that.

How it’s hurting him is he is constantly worried about things getting done and being done right. He’ll spend hours finding the perfect $5 soap on amazon and then worry for days if it was the right one. I’ll find him up at 6am before work checking on the toilet to see if it’s leaking even though he tested it all day. I realize it doesn’t sound that bad on paper but he can’t have a conversation, sleep, or eat without worrying. 

I’m really worried for him and have found groups, scheduled counselling, tried to get him into relaxing hobbies, found him multiple meditation and self help workbooks and apps but none of these work unless he actually wants to get better. 

How can I convince him that’s it’s gone beyond what’s normal nervousness before he has a heart attack? How can I support him? I don’t want to trick or ambush him with getting help but he needs it. He’s so unhappy.",anxiety
"Partner can't cope with my anxiety anymore  Hi all, I have struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I have tried various therapies and medications but never managed to find a good fit. 

My partner and I have been together for 7 years but he has now reached his breaking point. I don't think either of us realised how bad things had gotten. He is such a kind, loving soul and has always done everything in his power to support me and minimise the impacts of my anxiety. It has become routine for him to handle all of the day to day things I struggle with: phone calls, life admin, appointments, driving etc. I know he is constantly thinking of my triggers when we are in public and tries to avoid them. In the past year or so it has become worse and I no longer go out to social occasions with him or have friends of my own. If I'm honest, and I'm ashamed to admit this, he has become my whole world and I know it puts a lot of pressure on him. 

I have recently had a bad spell and been signed off work for a month. He no longer sees our relationship being sustainable and I completely understand. I am so desperate to change and we have talked at length about what would need to happen going forward for us to be together. My self confidence is so low and I'm scared I won't be able to. Has anyone been in similar positions to this and managed to improve things? I don't want to be the way I am at the moment - I feel like a shell of myself.

I am looking into private therapy, medication, reaching out to old friends, and I've been honest with my family about what is going on to try and build my support network. If anyone has any advice on what else I can do I would really appreciate it.

Neither of us want to give up on this relationship, we have built a whole life together and love eachother so much.

"Fear of sickness in my kids  Recently found out I have anxiety. Pretty sure I’ve struggled with it for quite some time. Do any other parents have crippling anxiety surrounding their children? It’s like I hyper fixate on their symptoms when sick. Currently, my 5 year old has a low grade fever that comes and goes, has complained of a headache off and on and did throw up a few days ago. He felt well enough to go to school for 2 days and now he’s complaining of a headache again and has a low grade fever again. He’s acting normal, just says he’s tired. My neighbors kids had the same thing last week (headaches and fevers that lasted a few days) so that’s reassuring but I can’t keep myself from googling. I haven’t slept in days. I’m worried sick. This happens every single time one of my children isn’t 100%. I think what triggered it was when my daughter (barely two at the time) had salmonella and it transferred to her blood stream. We were admitted to the hospital for several days and she responded quickly to treatment.

"Lyrica/Pregabalin Hello reddit,

I have been having intense panic attacks for 2 months now, and it got so bad I had to stop working. I went to psychiatric urgent care and got prescribed Lyrica. I should start with 25mg a day and up it every two days for 25mg, until I reach 150mg a day, then I should lower it again gradually.

Thing is, I have huge anxiety about this drug, because I've read so much about it. It's addictive, it causes weight gain, it makes your sleep horrible, ... the list goes on. 

I am still taking only 25mg, started on tuesday, and I'm incredibly scared to up the dose. In the beginning it made me feel calmer and happier, and I haven't had a panic attack since tuesday. Thing is, today I feel worse, I feel depressed, I cried again, and I'm scared that the 25mg won't be enough.

"Experiencing extreme anxiety and unable to study I'm facing one of the biggest challenges of my life with this upcoming exam, and the pressure is overwhelming. It’s a high-stakes test that could determine my future, and I’m already struggling to hold myself together.

 My anxiety has been relentless, leaving me emotionally drained and in constant fear of failing at something so important.

On top of that, I have to travel alone for ten hours just to take the exam, which only adds to my stress and makes everything feel even more daunting.

 I struggle with anxiety, especially with traveling alone, so I thought that having someone by my side might help me stay calm. 

Hoping for support, I asked my brother and sister to come with me, thinking they’d understand how much I needed them during such a difficult time.

But my brother’s response was harsh and dismissive—he misbehaved, making it clear he wasn’t interested in helping, and even suggested turning the trip into a vacation, with scenic stops I can't afford to take. 

His reaction felt like a dismissal of my needs, like he was trivializing something I find deeply overwhelming. All I wanted was reassurance, to feel supported by the people I trust, but instead, I felt alone and misunderstood. 

It’s disheartening to realize that, right when I needed support the most, I was left feeling abandoned, as if my struggles with anxiety weren’t worthy of anyone’s care or kindness.

"Health anxiety after a neighborhood cat bit me (lightly) Hi all, I struggle a lot with health anxiety. It's gotten better over the years but it's one of my most consistent struggles. 

The last week or so, a cute cat (slightly bigger than a kitten) has been showing up around my house. We've fed it a few times and it's very energetic, jumps in front of you while you're walking, is affectionate, etc. 

Seems like typical kitten behavior. Today as I was leaving the house in sandals, in addition to jumping ahead of me, it started pouncing towards my legs and at one point it seemed to playfully bite the back of my leg. 

The bite didn't break skin as far as I can see, but I'm getting a bit freaked out about potential rabies exposure. 

I know transmission from cats is basically unheard of these days and that kittens can be aggressive when playing, but I can't shake the fear that a rabid squirrel or something small could have bitten it at some point. 

I always figured if a small cat was attacked by a rabid animal, it would likely not survive, but I started panicking thinking about squirrels since a bite from one of those might not be fatal. 

Trying to calm down but it's been a hard week at work and life so this just compounds the anxiety I'm feeling. I'm torn because I really, really don't want to get a rabies vaccine if it's not a serious possibility, especially given how kittens can act. But I also don't want to be foolish by dismissing potential risk. ",anxiety

I pulled over and after crying I thought I could do it. So I made my way back. Of course I feel so nervous  going back in but I do it. Immediately once I enter the store I feel terrible. Sometimes I forget how bad the fear gets. I decided to not clock in and get someone to get the manager for me. I had to tell them I was leaving because of my bad anxiety. I couldn’t even lie and tell them that I just felt sick or had actually something. I was a hot mess. I am so embarrassed to tell people I have anxiety because of my bad experiences of people making fun of me in the past. I can’t believe I actually told my managers I was leaving because of “anxiety”. Ugh. I feel so dumb!! Everyone has anxiety. I don’t feel like that was a proper reason to leave. Oh and the store wasn’t even busy. I guess I don’t feel that guilty because normally it’s just me and the manager working. I left and there was 4 people there. Ugh. I cried so much already. I can’t believe I’m still dealing with anxiety. My entire life has been in misery because of this. Can’t hang, can’t eat at restaurants, can only eat 4 hours before going out or something bad will happen. I’m so sick of it all. Sorry for the long rant.

"Going back on sertraline after years  I used to take sertraline for anxiety/panic disorder for 2-3 years.
Initially during the first 4-6 weeks everything got worse which is common but after that it changed my life completely. I didn’t have a single panic attack, I talked to people, I was adventurous and my IBS even went into remission. 

When I went for a refill one time, the doctor (I’ve never met before) told me that I’d been on it too long and I should be fine, there’s no reason for me to be depressed/anxious. So I slowly weaned myself off. For about a year I was ok, then I started to notice things coming back. 

Now 2-3 years on I’m suffering terribly from spontaneous panic attacks, I don’t want to go anywhere, I’m scared of germs, of food, of ridiculous things. My IBS is back in its full glory. I’m constantly thinking whenever I go out I’m going to have my next panic attack. 

Last night I had 4 panic attacks in a row and I just decided that’s it. I’m going to go back on sertraline.

"If you're super anxious about the events yesterday in the USA, I highly recommend checking yourself to make sure you aren't catastrophizing. *Linked an informational video in the comments*

Catastrophizing is when we automatically jump to the absolute worst, most disastrous conclusions about a situation, without being able to fully back it up with facts or trying to see other more helpful and *realistic* perspectives.

It can be very hard to open ourselves up to the idea that not everything is awful, because awful can feel more comforting then uncertainty.

An example could be assuming that just because he is back in office means that everything is going to go totally wrong or we'll all lose our democracy or have a civil war, or people comparing Trump to Hitler (which btw is super disrespectful to those who endured the holocaust)... without looking into stuff like the ways the supreme court and the constitution has levels of control over him, how the state governments set boundaries and protections, past things that we did to get through and prevent future issues. Our countries political system is specifically built in a way that can allow someone to have authoritarian *influence*, but makes it virtually impossible for the president to become a *true* dictator (remember, he's only allowed 8 total years in office so after this term, hes out. That is in the constitution).

 And you know how hes said stuff about overturning amendments in the constitution? That has only happened once in US history, for prohibition, and requires cooperation from the supreme court, the senate, congress and 2/3 of all US states. 

What things have we bounced back from or have improved even despite him being around? Well for one, in 2021 we got the first female vice pres in all of American history, which alone, is monumental and *you* are here for that. *Texas* just got its first openly lgbtqia+ member of congress, and the first transgender woman to ever get elected into congress just got elected. These are already incredible steps that were totally overshadowed by Trump being elected. 

I'm *not* saying this isn't a bad situation for many of us, and I'm not saying it's wrong to feel upset or worried or that you should just ""look on the bright side"", but I'm saying that the future implications most likely will not amount to being the *absolute worst things possible* that the news, our anxiety or our family/friends would lead us to believe.

I definitely recommend just trying to open yourself up to the idea that *maybe, just possibly*... everything won't go absolutely wrong, and looking into the video linked. And being open to challenging your thinking.",anxiety

It honestly weighs my spirit down so much, I just recently got off my depression pills and have been good for a couple months but now I feel like I have to start taking them again. 

All I feel is anxiety and I can’t make it go away. It bothers me so much. Even when I’m not working or just got off work I still feel like shit. Whyyyyyyyy. 

I’ve been wanting to start streaming or something for a while, to do something I enjoy but I always hold myself back, and now I deal with the consequences of feeling miserable. Idk :/ ",anxiety

"Weird rush in head So I found this post from 3 years ago that explains it quite well so I’m going to copy and paste it:

Not looking for medical advice just wondering has anyone else experienced this weird scary sensation? Comes on randomly or during an anxious moment. I describe it as a head rush. It’s like as if you stood up really quickly but it happens at rest so sitting, lying down and when standing or walking. When this happens it either feels like that, or a sinking sensation in my head and I feel kind of woozy after it it’s kinda like a mild faint and I also get a fright so I get an adrenaline type feeling in my chest or stomach. Sometimes I get a hot flash. I’ve had this sensation for so long I think maybe nearly 2 years or since the start of last year but I started getting it constantly maybe last autumn.

I want to add: mine kinda makes me pause like it’s short circuiting and it’s always one of my temples then I kinda loose hearing. It lasts like 2 seconds. Sometimes it triggers me to have an anxiety attack and shoots to my chest cause that’s what happens when I get anxious. Please tell me I’m not alone in these weird head rushes! I have muscle spasms too but I don’t freak out over those cause I get those everywhere. My PC keeps saying it’s all anxiety but how do I know it’s not something as severe as a brain tumor. ",anxiety

"Tight/pressure/burning feeling in hands and feet… 29 (F). Currently diagnosed with Endometriosis, very mild ulcerative colitis, GERD, anxiety/depression disorder, somatic symptom disorder. Not sure what to make of this. So I’ve had most tests done. Lots of blood work, MRIs, CT scans, X rays, heart checked, etc. Recently my left foot started to feel pressure on top of it and the muscle tight feeling spread to my calf…. ( out of the blue with no injury sustained) This feeling has been on going for a week. Then my toes started to burn. That feeling would spread to my whole foot then subside. Family doctor couldn’t find anything wrong, she told me to see a foot doctor if the issue persisted. (Can’t see foot doc cause they’re super full) In the meantime I kept my left foot elevated and iced it as she recommended. Nothing has really helped. My mind kept wandering to the thought of having a DVT. I’ve been trying to let it go. Then the same feeling spread to my other leg. (This feeling in my legs seems worst at rest then when I’m moving around) Now my freaking hands feel tight/pressure/tingling and they just hurt and it doesn’t stop. I feel as if it all calms down a little when I’m distracted, but it just comes right back. It was my entire left arm the other day. Very tight and painful. Now both my hands feel like I have been over using them. Very tight and uncomfortable upon waking up. I’m at my wits end and I’m tired of doctors visits only to be looked at like I’m crazy…. I don’t want to do anything cause of the on going issues… I want to feel better, but I don’t know what to do. Anytime I try to improve myself I feel worst in the end. I’m scared all the time. Any advice will do at this time. Cause I’m mentally exhausted. I realize my symptoms could be or are obviously somatic, but I’ve never had this many limb issues firing off at once.

"How to break a recent anxious habit after a break-up? I was recently broken up with after a 2-year relationship with a person I still live with.

"How do I combat subconscious anxiety?  How do I combat anxiety that remains deep in my subconscious? No matter what I do - even if I am consciously not anxious - anxiety always manifests in some way for me. The way it manifests is:

* Around girls I'm interested in, I get awkward sometimes, try to overcompensate, and have the girl lose interest in me
* When I'm tired, it's very hard for me to socialize 
* IBS symptoms
* Can't sleep the night before a major event
* Can't sleep the night before a flight
* When I'm sleepy, I can hardly function 

Maybe some of this is normal. But the thing that makes me mad is the girl thing. I get a lot of attention from girls that are attractive, and the fact that my anxiety comes in even when I consciously try not to make me upset.

i was due for my refill couple days ago and my pharmacy was saying they've tried contacting my provider 3x and haven't had a response to get my refill approved. i explained to them the process of how i see him every 3 months and he writes 3 refills for me to pick up one monthly. before i was going to give him a call, the pharmacist abruptly tells me i'm able to get my prescription. i'm like ok, awesome. 

i get home just to find out i got advagen and not teva. i didn't even open the packaging and went back up there immediately nicely asking if there was a way i could exchange for another generic (didn't even specify teva) and they said it's against their policy. which makes sense bc it *is* a controlled substance but i told them my psych  specifically wants me on teva and basically were of no help. these orange pills are shit. they don't last. they take forever to kick in. i never realized how good teva was until i didn't have it. i honestly don't even believe there is any type of clonazepam molecule in this. i've been reading how teva was having shortages and was due to be back in august... and now november 8th (ironically the date i post this) i'm hoping my next script will be teva....",anxiety

"Looking for recommendations for books on anxiety beyond work/ perfectionism related anxiety  I listen to a lot of audiobooks on anxiety while doing chores around the house as it really helps me feel like I’m at least working on my mental health and gives me hope that it can approve.. however if I listen to one more book that’s meant to help my anxiety and all the author mentions is exam or work anxiety or anxiety around perfectionism I might finally snap 🤪

While these are all very valid reasons to feel anxiety , I fear mine is more in the realm of “everyone I love has or will die and I can’t stop ruminating on how I won’t be able to cope with it and I might actually drop dead from the stress of how emotionally exhausting life is ” kind of anxiety and I’m having a hard time finding anyone talking about that in a book.

"Do my friends hate me or am I super paranoid? This is my first post ever on this account and I never have felt a need to post about anything. I just don’t know how to go about anything at this point I guess. So to give a little back story I (20 F) live with two girls from high school. I knew both of them separately one from freshman year and one from sophomore year. I introduced them to each other our junior year and everything was great till the summer before going to college. We all decided to live together to the school we were all going to during our senior year, but that summer before going to college both of them stopped talking to me. It really sent me in a spiral because I am very hyper emotional and care so much about everyone’s opinions all the time. So I talked to them trying to fix things before we moved and it helped but things just changed. I was really close with both of them in our own separate relationships but now it just kind of feels like they hate me. If I come home first and am in my room and they come home they won’t come say hi to me, but they do it to each other. They always are hanging out and never inviting me. If I walk into on of their rooms (they leave their doors open for the dog, I don’t because I’m an art student and I don’t want the dog to eat anything) they stop talking even though they were non stop talking before, I can hear them all the way from my room with the door closed. We did get into a argument last year about it and they said I was pushing them away and that it’s my fault. So I told them I’m sorry and that I would like them to just want to hang out with me and even though my door is closed it’s just because I don’t want the dog to choke on anything in my room or destroy anything in my room. I love that dog but I grew up with never having the dog in my room and I guess I’m just used to it. The dog also tears up anything squishy it can get its paws on. Building upon that, even if I’m in the living room and they come in they will just go to their own rooms and if the other one come home they will just like acknowledge my presence and go talk to the other. I always have to be the one to go to them first. It just feels like they don’t want anything to do with me. It’s also not just a trip thing because we have another friend who comes over everyday and she likes me but it’s obvious she prefers my roommates and it goes with all of our friends. They all have each other’s locations and not mine, and I feel like when I talk nobody cares, everyone just kind of looks away and doesn’t seem interested. I live with them because I can’t live by myself because I am super extrovert and when I’m by myself I go into a depression episode which last a while but even living with them and when I don’t make an effort to go an socialize, I’ll go into a spiral. There has been so many days where I have been sick or have a migraine and nobody checks on me, nobody texts me, I have to get up and just like make my presence known so I don’t go into a depression spiral. But if one of them are sick or have a migraine they are there for each other no matter what. I was literally in the ER (lung issues) the other day and I asked if they could bring me a blanket and like just a little snack because I was freezing and I hadn’t eaten at all that day. They all said they were busy and then when I called one of them about the dog when I got home, she said they were all in the car. I don’t know if it’s me issue am I just like hated? What did I do wrong? Am I to ugly? Because they are all really pretty and skinny and I’m not. Do I talk too much? Am I annoying? Also when we go out they always leave me and I never know where they go. So I end up like sitting by myself or dancing by myself. I’m trying not think they hate me because when I ask they are like no we don’t hate you and look at me like I’m crazy but then they do all of this and more that I haven’t explained on here and I would never do anything to a friend like leaving them by themselves at a party or not going to go seem them when they are sick. Don’t get me wrong I love doing things for people and I love getting things for people I just don’t understand if I’ve done something wrong, or if I’m crazy.

"I struggle to sleep in the dark without having panic attacks  I used to have pretty crippling anxiety for a good 5 years of my life, I’ve always been anxious as a kid, but from 20-25 it was awful and a daily battle. I’m 33 now and I no longer get the regular panic attacks, hypochondria, general daily dread and on edge feeling, etc etc.. But one thing that has stuck with me, is not being able to sleep in the dark - when my anxiety and panic disorder first showed up, I was scared of going to bed because I would have full blown panic attacks just as I was going to sleep and it was terrifying having never felt that feeling before. So a coping mechanism I used, was sleeping with my tv on, to have that noise and light to distract my brain from the dread of waking up in panic in a pitch black room. As I said, now I’m 33 and through the other side of my anxiety, but I still wake up to panic if I wake up and my tv has gone off, does anyone else have a similar story or experience with darkness panic?

Trying to recall virtually any memory brings me to tears either because (1) it’s sad or (2) I can’t recall it and that makes me sad.

"GAD diagnosis - doesn’t feel accurate  Hey! I (F 30’s) received a GAD diagnosis today after receiving a multi appointment psych evaluation. 
I was primary seeking some insights and recommendations for a lot of neurodiverse symptoms I have which include: issues with mental focus on tasks, sensory issues, physical feelings of stress (migraines, GI issues, tension/restless muscles). 
For context, I’ve tried to get support for this before and the symptoms did not improve much with Wellbutrin, lexapro, or propranolol (I was taking this for migraines but as you may know it really ramps down anxiety). I’ve also taken stimulants short term and felt very calm and focused on them. 
The doctor ultimately gave me the GAD dx with the caveat that my anxiety is “atypical” because it’s more body based and that I have moderate sensory issues and moderate visual processing issues. They told me I could try therapy (have been doing for years), biofeedback for anxious thought patterns and focus (I don’t have a lot of anxious thoughts), sleeping better (I generally get 7+ hours of sleep per night, eating healthy/regularly (I already do this for migraines), try meds like ssri’s (I know there are many but am reluctant to try after having a bad experience on lexapro) and try mindfulness (I have been doing this for years and have a hard time keeping a consistent routine but practice yoga multiple times per week). She also said she would advocate for me taking non stimulant adhd meds??

It honestly left me feeling incredibly frustrated and like I’ve been diagnosed with hysteria or melancholia or some other historic “woman’s disease”. *Not because I think GAD isn’t legit, but because I feel my symptoms do not add up to it but they wanted to give me an answer. I’m not even sure I’d have adhd (maybe I don’t meet the diagnostic criteria for anything!). But this doesn’t feel right in my gut. 

So my question is- do any of you experience anxiety but have it more in your body than your mind?

Or anyone with advice/a similar experience?

Do you think this is a misdiagnosis?

Maybe I just need to learn more about different forms of anxiety?

Thanks so much!

"Scared to pick up antibiotics at pharmacy To make the story as short as possible, I had a strep throat test come back positive last week late on Monday (10/28). I was too sick that next day to drive myself to the pharmacy to pick up the antibiotics I was prescribed, so I decided to wait until the next day. Somehow, my anxiety got the best of me and told me that I couldn’t go pick up the medication. There was no reason. I just couldn’t get myself to go. It’s now more than a week later and I still have a lingering cough, which of course has triggered my hypochondriac tendencies and I am now extremely anxious about not having taken the antibiotics. I know, it was dumb. I am beating myself up for it. 

That being said, I want to go get the antibiotics and take them just to clear up everything and ensure I’m not causing myself more problems. The pharmacy sent me a text saying they are holding the medication for 7 more days, so I know they still have it. The problem is I’m worried the person checking me out will see that the prescription was called in over a week ago and judge me, or have questions, or think it’s weird?

"How to use CBT to deal with current changes in the USA. A politically neutral post. 1. Write down what you fear is going to happen. Be as specific as possible. E.g. I believe that X will do Y, to Z, in W specific way, and B specific thing will cause C, and it will happen on S date, etc. Just this step in itself can help, as writing something out, getting it out of your head, can sometimes show us that we're catastrophising.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gl9gbu/if_youre_super_anxious_about_the_events_yesterday/


2. Rate how confident you are, that what you believe will happen, will happen. E.g. from 0-100, select a number, with 0 = I don't think this will happen at all, to 100 = this is definitely going to happen. 


3. Write down what emotions are coming up. 


4. Rate the level of severity of emotion, from 0-100. 


5. Send it to yourself through an email to yourself so as you have a copy of it that's easy to find, with a record of the time, date, etc. 


6. When an anxious thought about your prediction comes up, just use mindfulness, defusion, breathwork techniques, etc. and refocus your attention on building a world and life you value. 


7. If a new concern comes up, go through the same steps as here for it. 


This way, if you were right to be worried, you can enjoy the satisfaction of knowing you were right, and sharing this information with a friend who is of a different belief to you could provide a learning experience for them. However, if you end up being wrong, this can provide a great learning experience to reflect on how you were so confident about something that never ended up happening. Either way this facilitates objective insight and learning, provided through CBT.",anxiety
"What are common side affects you experienced with Buspirone? I (41F) was just prescribed Buspirone (15mg 3X a day) for anxiety and took the first two doses today.

"Anxious that my friend might be distancing herself I’ll start off with some background info. I work night shifts at hotels and have a friend that does the same. We used to talk on the phone pretty much every night, and on our free weeks (7-on-7-off schedule) we’d always meet up to have a meal and play some games & recently go to the gym.  
  
Our hotels are quite different. Mine is very peaceful, there’s pretty much nothing going on all night and I work alone. Hers can get very busy and hectic and she works with a colleague in reception as well as sometimes people in other positions, such as security guards.  

About a month or so ago she stopped calling and coupled with her being kind of short with her texts I started getting anxious. I don’t mind spending the nights by myself, but I started wondering if she has started to prefer to talk to other people instead of me, like the colleague she works with. I brought it up 2 weeks ago for the first time and said that maybe it’s just anxiety, but that I was wondering if I was getting replaced. She said something along the lines of “nah i’ve just been down and i don’t look at my phone much”. It wasn’t the most reassuring of texts, but I said okay and said that I’m here if there’s anything I can do to make her feel better. We ended up not meeting on the free week we had, which hasn’t happened in a while.  
  
The other day my anxiety started flaring back up and I wrote a long text to her explaining how my brain overanalyses things and reaches the worst possible conclusions and that I’m still worried/sorry if I’m being clingy. She, again, responded in a way that didn’t come off very reassuring and sort of cold. It was along the lines of “as I said, I’m not on my phone much and it’s been busy here and I’m too tired to meet. and I don’t know why we haven’t spoken on the phone, you haven’t called either”. I had already made it clear in my message that us not talking/meeting isn’t the issue, but rather that the sudden change worries me and I’m essentially just looking for some reassurance that my anxieties are unfounded. But I replied, since she brought it up, that part of why I haven’t called her myself is because of the above mentioned differences between our hotels a.k.a. I assumed she was too busy, but also primarily it was because I’ve been anxious that she doesn’t want to talk to me + that the way her writing has read to me made me feel like I might be an annoyance. She responded with “yeah idk what to tell you, maybe my messages have been a bit short, but if you are worried about bothering with your calls you could’ve texted and asked”.  
  
I don’t know why, but I felt really upset by this. I had already been brought to tears by these worries earlier and I was just hoping for some reassuring words. I wrote back a somewhat snappy response saying “well i was hoping you might tell me i’m mistaken and that you still like me and want me around instead of being cold. […] sorry i even brought this up”. I know I typed it out or hurt feelings, but I felt frustrated because one day when I’d been quiet and distant and she ended up feeling anxious and worrying our friendship was ending (even though it wasn’t at all and i told her as much as soon as i found out), she spoke to me rather harshly and gave me a hard time because of how my silence made her feel. But now that I’ve been clear that I’ve been worrying for a month about a similar thing she can’t even reassure me and has as of now soon not replied in two whole days. I don’t know what to do. I’m even more anxious now thinking I was right and that she will end our friendship..   ",anxiety

"Stopped Prozac cold turkey I stopped my 20mg Prozac cold turkey around August 19th of this year. I was slowly tapered from 40 at the beginning of the year. Stupid, I know. I was stressed out and took the wrong medication on a week long trip. I had already been taking it a bit irregularly due to my OCD (I have a fear of medications and also severe health anxiety). I didn’t notice any difference and actually felt better, up until September 23rd or so where I noticed old ocd thoughts popping up. My doc then put me back on the Prozac (20mg). My anxiety was getting worse and worse by the day, my external stressors also weren’t helping (going through a lot of financial and marriage issues, also a lot of changes at work). I had my first panic attack in q very long time that made me have to stop in the middle of the road to calm down. It had been 4 years since I called 911 due to a panic attack, and I did so on October 23rd. EKG normal they sent me home. Didn’t sleep for 24 hours cause the anxiety wouldn’t stop. Went to the ER the next day at 4am for chest pain, now 48 hours no sleep. Doctor said I probably had a pinched nerve. The cycle kept going and my panic attacks were getting closer and closer to eachother. I woke up with extremely weak legs and arms, to this day it feels like I have sandbags on them. I have not been able to eat more than 2 protein shakes a day, constantly dry heaving. I feel and electric pulsing through my body, and my hands are constantly cramping. Went to the neurologist due to ALS fear and he basically laughed in my face (I get why) but did the EMG and other tests anyways and they came out negative. Still worrier it's too early to catch. 

my question is- could stopping the prozac in august still be causing all of these horrid symptoms even though i started back in October with an even higher dose? 

i am working very closely with my therapist and psychiatrist, would just like some support from folks who may have experienced this first hand. thank you. ",anxiety

"Need reassurance  So Monday night I was having sort of a mental breakdown like depression kind and it flipped 180 quickly. I took a big rip of my weed cart and it induced a panic attack bad enough to feel cold sweat and scream uncontrollably. I was stuttering and felt like I was gonna faint. 

I go to the Er and they drew my blood *they never sent it to the lab, I saw it sitting there with my name labeled,when I was leaving :(* they took forever while I was having waves of anxiety before giving me a Xanax. It helped and I went home but the whole night was wave after wave of panic. The next next I think I'm fine and smoke again *bad idea* I was fine until I start having waves and waves at night. Going into cold sweat and feeling faint. 

The next day I wake up panicking and go to a psych hospital twice. The first time they sent me home cause I was able to stop my anxiety on my own in the lobby and gave me venlafaxine. I took the venlafaxine and took a nap, woke up on fire and vibrating so I went back. I calmed down a bit and they gave sent me a prescription for hydroxyzine. When I left , I started again took the hydroxyzine as soon as I picked it up. 

It barley helped and I've been having waves of panic and cold sweat since yesterday. It stopped for a while a few times today and I managed to nap for 1 hour after taking a hydroxyzine again at 2pm. I woke up at 3 and I'm still getting waves of cold sweat and my neck feels tight. 

They did a EKG yesterday so I assume that if they said I'm fine, then I'm fine. 

I'm just scared of the weird chest pain I'm starting to have and the fact that the panic will not stop. It comes every 30 minutes or even 15. I can't stop it for more than 30 minutes at most if im lucky. 

I'm posting mostly to get this off my chest and hopefully someone will have advice to help me feel better.  

I know feeling numb, pins and needle is normal for panic. But the chest pain and feeling like passing out scares me. I tried to eat but felt like passing out and had to stop twice. I gave up and put my food away. 

It's the damn tingling and vibrating that's making this difficult. My body feels like a human vibrator. 

At what point should I seek medical help? 

My neck keeps tightening but when I calm it stops kinda. 

*update!!*

I feel better after borrowing a weighted blanket. It also has helped that I've been talking to others with anxiety and learning methods. Knowing that it's just adrenaline from a fight or flight response also helped me.

"My health has been terrible recently and i've been worried about dying for the past week. I (18 M) have been struggling with health problems for the past month and a half. Which was mainly because I caught an amoeba in my stomache and because of the exams I had coming up. I've been going to doctors over and over again and each time They assign a different medicine for me. Until recently (around two weeks ago) it got to the point where Im just suffering every time i try to sleep. Because my conditions keep getting worse specifically when im tryig to sleep. And for these past 2 weeks every day felt like it could have been my last.

But then I always end up falling asleep and worrying about tomorrow instead.

My parents as well as many doctors claim that the biggest cause of all this is my mental health due to the pressure that I had from the exams. As well as my severe anxiety at night from my symptoms worsening. They've been telling me that I should stop stressing so much as it only makes things worse. But never in my life was I so terrified... these past 2 weeks has been nothing but suffering. Each night being different than the other in terms of which kind of sickness im feeling.
Sometimes its stomachaches, sometimes its dizziness, fever, nausea, and now im struggling with heart palpitations and problems specifically with my head. Like confusion and disorientation. As well as a bit of numbness on my face and head.

Now im obviously not asking for a diagnosis. Though I would appreciate it if any of you could tell me about a subreddit that I could use for asking for healt concerns. As going to the doctors every other day just for closure is expensive and googling my symptoms will not be very convenient.

But for now all I want to do here is get this out of my system. Right now it is almost 4 AM and im unable to sleep because im worried of dying in my sleep like every other day i had for the past 2 weeks... if this isn't pure anxiety i have no idea what is...

Long story short my dad is one of my stressors for sure but I love him and forgive him for the previous years that he put our family through.

My Dad has been taking lexapro and Wellbutrin because he has the same disorders as I do. He says that they’re safe and worth it.

My mom whilst sitting right beside him will say that they can make my mental illnesses worse and that basically I’m fine without it.

Normally my mom is the biggest person I trust for advice but I don’t know about this one.

"On handling working with anxiety I am 22, and for the last year I have struggled with handling any tasks, whether it’s maintaining a job or maintaining success at school. To cooking, walking our dog, cleaning and washing clothes. The thought of it all fills me with anxiety.

I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I am prescribed duloxetine and was just prescribed buspar. I have gone to therapy for the last four years going on to five.

I’ve attended some college. Only worked customer service. And I’m first generation living in a single parent household.

Although I have in the past found my own successes, it has been incredibly difficult to maintain any of it. Currently I get panic attacks and acid reflux just from my anxiety alone. The worst part of it is that I can barely support myself emotionally and financially, yet I’m expected to provide for my family as well. I haven’t any issues with this, if I had a stable job I’d be able to do just fine. But how can I find a stable job when my own stability is at question. 

Financially I’m a mess, I have several thousands in debt with credit cards and I don’t have any income to pay bills. 

Every time I’ve been hired by a job, they have mentioned an issue with my ‘consistency’ and it’s almost become a bad word in my head. I come in eager to learn and work hard, and once it comes to a certain task or a certain behavior that I perform not at their expectations I get in my head severely and desire to just give up and quit.

"Not sure if my anxiety is bad enough to take medication Hi! I am not sure how to properly explain this

I have been dealing with depression on and off for my whole life basically, I have also dealt with anxiety, but I feel like being anxious is being my “normal” self, so I am not even sure what is treatable or if I am overreacting at this point. 

My doctor recommended I take Ativan (Lorazepam - 1gm) every time I feel anxious 

My mom is basically against any kind of medication, so I had to bring her to my therapist so that she could explain to her why antidepressants are not bad. But she gets super defensive every time I mention Ativan, she says it is addictive and it won’t help me

Thing is, I am struggling so much lately with the physical symptoms (besides the mental ones which is what I am just used to at this point). Every day I wake up feeling incredibly anxious, my mouth is dry all the time, my tongue is hurting from the dryness. I have this kind of pressure on my chest that makes me feel unable to properly breathe, I cannot take a deep breath or yawn. A few days ago I believe I experienced some kind of panic attack, all I could see was black, my heart was racing extremely fast, I felt like I was going to die. I usually experience all of this during the morning mostly, as I am unable to wake up

I feel tired all the time and I cannot do anything other than exist. I am not sure what am I anxious about, but I just need to stop feeling like this. I don’t have other physical symptoms. 

Do you think it is reasonable to take Ativan considering the above?

I feel like such a whiny and no one really thinks it is that serious. I know it’s hard to imagine what anxiety feels like if you have never experienced it, but yeah. Thank you so much for any advice ",anxiety

"Scared I may have a brain tumor  I’m 27, since August I started experiencing odd pressure and dull ache on the left side of my head, mostly near my temple. It’s not persistent, comes and goes. Seems to be exacerbated by extreme lack of sleep and tiredness, but when that happens the pressure or pain will last for a couple days before it finally subsides. First time I experienced it in August was when I slept for only an hour and had to drive 12 hrs back home from Florida. Lasted for probably nearly a week. Then it happened again a couple weeks ago when I had only slept for three hours and had to get up early for a dentist appointment. And this week it happened again because I had a family emergency and had to go to the hospital and stayed up til 5am. Got back home and fell asleep for like 3 hours. But this was Sunday and since then I’ve been having headaches nearly everyday. 

I’m having a lot of anxiety about this I guess because my mom had passed away from a malignant brain tumor early this year and it happened so suddenly. And now I’m getting paranoid and googling symptoms and I’m getting nervous reading everything. My vision doesn’t seem to be affected nor my hearing, I don’t know if I have memory problems or not, I do get forgetful sometimes because I’ve been so stressed this year with my job and always running errands. I’m tired and fatigued allll the time no matter much sleep I try to get whenever I can. Sometimes the pressure or ache in my head will be worse in the morning and other times it stays the same all day. Sometimes I feel a little weak or light headed. 

I tried to make an appointment with my primary care doctor but he can’t even see me until January and I’m not willing to wait that long…. 

I’m hoping maybe it’s just extreme stress and anxiety causing all this because I know it can, and things have been extra rough this year with my mom passing and I’m still learning how to “adult” but still, I’m terrified thinking about this and the more I keep reading on google the more anxious I get. I just need reassurance for now guys… ",anxiety
Xanax question Which tablet strength is most commonly prescribed for panic attacks for someone who has never had a prescription for xanax before?,anxiety
"I just realised I have an insane anxiety about the way my teeth look, or how I look in general. What I also realised is that worrying about anxiety can devolve into a waste of time I've realized that I spent years of my life trying to fix my teeth, even though there was nothing there to be fixed. I worry about the way I look, smell, behave, even though that doesn't lead to any success. It is a weird obsession about being able to connect with other people, without realizing what it actually takes to communicate.

What I realized is the absolutely primary thing in communication is what you say. For my entire life my problem has been that the words I speak are completely different compared to the words I write over text, like in this very Reddit post. I've always wondered why my wishes I thought were never fulfilled. Today the reason is obvious to me because I never once spoke what I really wanted to say. I had this magical thinking that if I look perfect, people will like me, read my mind, do what I want. Is this narcissism? Maybe? My father is one, I might have copied some unhealthy behaviours.

If you are unable to speak what you want to say, you are unable to communicate. That is the realization I've had.

To come back to the fixing my teeth part: That is by far the worst obsession to have. It costs money, it leads to pain, it leads to nonsensical things I want to fix. And it takes lots, lots of time.

I realized the more I obsess about fixing my teeth, the unhappier my life will be. I am wasting so, so much time in regards to that, so much time that could be spend way better. Also, with what motivation exactyl? That my teeth look nice? My brother in Christ, teeth are for \*eating\*, we are animals. Sure nice teeth look good, I get that, but my teeth already \*do\* look good, what on earth is there to fix?

By the way I'm taking Sertraline now, and only now I see the absolute insanity that my obsessions and anxieties are. I like it, it makes me able to function. I doubt I will ever be able to live without antidepressants because I am a really, really, really anxious person without them. I noticed that with Sertraline, I am able to talk with other people as if I were texting them. Exactly what I wanted. Now I feel like I can connect with other people on an intellectual level and don't have to ""impress"" them with the way I look or whatever. What a ridiculous viewpoint. I'm not a male peacock trying to impress others with his feathers.

Time is finite on earth. That doesn't depress me. On the contrary. It motivates me to be happy, here, right now, and it makes me realise that if I continue listening to my anxieties, my obsessions, and I will be 70 years old and look back at my life, I will be utterly, utterly disappointed in what on earth I have done in my life.

The choice is yours, as I've realized. OCD is something you just have to stop. There is no other way around if as I've realized. It's frustrating, it's painfully hard. But you have to. Not even meds help with that; they enable you to see what obsessions are irrational and what not, and being able to resist compulsions. Meds help with a general feeling of anxiety, a main motivation for OCD as I've figured out.

I want to add that I've also realized that anxiety is a nice thing to have. It is a nice feeling to have when you have a weird feeling of anxiety and actually realist there is an actually valid reason for it. It is, however, not good when that spirals out of control into obsessions and compulsions, or worse, derealizations/depersonalizations as I've experienced in the past.

If you struggle to the point of anxiety where it starts to hinder your life, please seek out help. There is help out there, as I've realized. Your mind might be clouded by irrational fears like ""No one understands me. Everyone hates me"". I've experienced those thoughts in the past, too. It required an insane amount of willpower to push through this irrational construct of my mind. But eventually I did it, and it was absolutely worth it. There are ways. There is help out there. It might be hard to find. But it is out there. There are 8 billion people out there. Surely, someone will understand you, and is willing to help you.",anxiety
"Left work because of anxiety.  I am so embarrassed. I just left work early because my anxiety was so bad. First I called in to say I was going in late and once I got into the parking lot, I panicked so bad I immediately  started driving to make my way back home. Not safe to do that. I’m so sad. I pulled over and after crying I thought I could do it. So I made my way back. Of course I feel so nervous  going back in but I do it. Immediately once I enter the store I feel terrible. Sometimes I forget how bad the fear gets. I decided to not clock in and get someone to get the manager for me. I had to tell them I was leaving because of my bad anxiety. I couldn’t even lie and tell them that I just felt sick or had actually something. I was a hot mess. I am so embarrassed to tell people I have anxiety because of my bad experiences of people making fun of me in the past. I can’t believe I actually told my managers I was leaving because of “anxiety”. Ugh. I feel so dumb!! Everyone has anxiety. I don’t feel like that was a proper reason to leave. Oh and the store wasn’t even busy. I guess I don’t feel that guilty because normally it’s just me and the manager working. I left and there was 4 people there. Ugh. I cried so much already. I can’t believe I’m still dealing with anxiety. My entire life has been in misery because of this. Can’t hang, can’t eat at restaurants, can only eat 4 hours before going out or something bad will happen. I’m so sick of it all. Sorry for the long rant. 

I don’t know how I’m gonna face my actual manager again or if I’m even going to be able to work. I think I’m just going to quit unless they fire me anyways. I’m so so so so so embarrassed. Literally thinking about this in the car is making me cringe. I can’t believe I actually left. I was already feeling bad this entire day yet I thought I would be doing something wrong if I found someone to cover me. Truth is I should’ve got someone to cover me and this would’ve never happened. 😣😔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔

"Issues with friends who drink due to past trauma - how to stop the anxiety? Long story short, I have an alcoholic ex. Aside from violence, every problem you can imagine popped up with that. Gaslighting, stealing from me, hiding his habits, etc.

He's long since out of my life but the effects remain, as well as having had 2 family members pass due to alcohol addictions. 

When I drink with friends in real life, I'm all right, probably because I can see them and know that they're all right? And I drink maybe once or twice a month, if that.

My best friend, however, lives in the UK - I'm in America - and evidently they have wildly different drinking cultures over there. Every day she has at least one glass of wine, usually before/with dinner, though sometimes has more. Back in May she took a month long break after going on a binge that was VERY concerning. Maybe I haven't recovered from that either. But she took the break, supposedly, and was back to the usual habits. She hasn't drank that much or that heavily in one go since.

At the moment she's on vacation and has been drinking slightly more. I suggested she take today off maybe, which she agreed to do and said it was a good idea. But she forgot while out having dinner, and I was greeted with mild typos that just sent me instantly spiraling into a panic attack. I asked her to please take a few weeks or a month off because, to me, this amount and frequency of drinking doesn't seem healthy. She's also on Setraline (Zoloft) for depression - which I've told her numerous times before she's not meant to drink on *anyway*.

In the meantime, how do I combat this anxiety? I don't want to like, control her of course, but every few months I get a little more concerned that she never takes breaks, and I don't know if it's something I can be around long term. If anyone has any advice I would greatly appreciate it ;;",anxiety

"Personal journey with withdrawals and anxiety  My personal journal/ journey with withdrawals and anxiety 

I didn’t worry about my health until last Monday when I had my heart rate spike, couldn’t breath, felt dizzy, and almost passed out. I had a history of smoking weed for a long time  and did a couple other drugs a long the way. Since that day I completely cut out weed and nicotine and would never consider doing other drugs. I got severely sick after the first couple of days, actual medical issues, after that cleared I’ve been having what I think is the worst anxiety and depression of my life. I don’t feel like myself in the slightest bit. I’ve been very worried about my heart, and when I start thinking about it seems to get way worse. I can sometimes feel my heartbeat throughout my whole body and seem to overthink way to much when it happens, I’ve also never had severe anxiety before. It’s about day 5 or 6 and I woke up at 12 ate than went back to bed, I never take naps or such but my body felt so depleted. It’s been a hour since I woke up and my thoughts are scrambled and seem to come in waves. I want to feel normal again but I’m not sure what normal is anymore.

"Unable to stop anxiety, and unable to detect why it's happening. (to an extent) I have a few suspicions as to why I have such random anxiety every few days, ranging from ruminating about my past toxic relationship, family, and all that stuff. I can identify and recognize that I am anxious because of these things.

However, from time to time, let's say every few other days or so, I just have completely random moments where I get INTENSE waves of anxiety lasting anywhere from a couple of minutes to the entire day, not dissipating until the next morning at all, and I have absolutely no explanation for them. During such moments I am not thinking about anything anxiety-inducing. I could even be fully relaxed, having fun, or whatever, and STILL experience these debilitating random waves of anxiety.

What has worked in such situations have been benzodiazepines and weed but I don't want to rely on them for any longer than I should to calm down my anxiety.

I have tried multiple other things, such as changing my lifestyle, taking daily walks, and doing everything I can in my free time to relax and while it DOES work, there are just some days that I get a random wave of anxiety (light to absolutely devastating) and I cannot pinpoint why. Usually, I can deal with it, but sometimes it's so bad it leads me to take high doses of anxiety medication to calm me down. This happens every week, purely randomly, and has been going on for a few months. I will talk to a therapist soon and see what's up, but I'd love to hear some thoughts and advice. Thanks",anxiety

Hey guys. I’m sure a lot of y’all are feeling like I am this week. 

A lot of my anxiety hits at night and when I wake up. I have awful nightmares that seem to continue even after I wake up for a few mins. 

I always try to be a ‘casual observer’ of my physical symptoms and acknowledge it for what it is - flight or fight misfires - but it does not make them go away all the time.

"I Had an Episode During a Drug Test, and My Supervisor Surprised Me Hi everyone,

I wanted to share an experience I had recently that really opened my eyes. I’ve dealt with paruresis (shy bladder syndrome) for a long time. It’s one of those invisible struggles that I don’t talk about, even though it’s a big source of anxiety in my life. Most of the time, I can avoid situations where it’s a problem, but recently I had to do a mandatory drug test at work, and it hit me hard.

As soon as I walked into the testing room, the familiar feeling kicked in: my heart racing, my mind spiraling, and that crushing feeling of, ""What if I can't go? What will they think of me?"" I tried, but nothing happened. I was frozen and mortified, feeling like I’d been exposed in the worst way.

But then, something I never expected happened. My supervisor noticed I was struggling, and instead of making it awkward or pressuring me, she came over and gently asked if I was okay. She didn’t make a big deal about it or ask intrusive questions. She simply said, ""It’s okay. If you need a moment, take all the time you need.""

We stepped outside for some fresh air, and she shared that her own friend struggles with anxiety around similar situations. She even mentioned that our company offers mental health resources, including some support for anxiety-related conditions. She told me I could try again whenever I felt ready, with no rush or judgment.

I used to think that revealing something like this would make me seem weak or unprofessional, but her understanding changed my perspective. If you’re dealing with something similar, whether it’s paruresis, social anxiety, or any other hidden struggle, please know there are people who genuinely understand and want to help. There’s no shame in needing a little extra support.

"First panic attack? Advice greatly appreciated Hey guys, for context I am F in my late teens and I have had a couple anxiety disorder my whole life, mostly affective social interaction, it is quite severe. I also have family history of anxiety disorders and panic disorder (I do not have this one to my knowledge)

So for the past week I’ve been unwell with quite a bad flu, but I’ve returned to school despite feeling slightly under the weather. In class I started feeling a little bit dizzy, I thought nothing of it but I started to worry about it a little and it started to get worse, like I started thinking something was really wrong with my heart rate and my arms started going tingly. Anyway I asked to go home as I was feeling faint, after that I felt so much worse, at this point I was convinced that something was horribly wrong and that I was about to just drop and die, I thought I was having a heart attack, stroke and everything, I just kept checking my pulse and everything. I thought my flu gave me sepsis or something, I know it sounds so stupid but at the time I was so convinced. I also had this really really severe impending sense of doom. When I got home my parents who is a doctor checked my blood pressure and heart rate and just told me it’s slightly elevated and that I’m probably panicking. The symptoms lasted for about 10-15 more mins but I started to relax after they reassured me I wasn’t having a heart attack or whatever I was thinking.

"Managing Post-COVID Health Anxiety Hey everyone 👋🏽25M here. I caught COVID for what I believe was the third time at the end of August and recovered rather quickly, after about 1.5 weeks. I felt good for the first half of September but had a major depressive/anxiety episode at the end of the month. My mind was racing after believing I had a blood clot and while I’ve gotten much better and began Prozac at the end of last week to manage my anxiety, I’ve still struggled with intrusive thoughts related to health anxiety. I’ve read about some complications even younger people have gotten after multiple COVID infections and I’ve gotten anxiety about having blood clots, strokes or developing some underlying cardiovascular issue. I’ve had blood work done, an ultra sound of my heart and worn a Holter monitor for 5 days and I’ve come back fine. 

Does anyone have any advice for combatting these fears about developing some serious health issue after COVID?

it’s frustrating bc i do want to go. there are people there who id like to see, work opportunities down the line which rely on me being able to go there, etc. i’m paying money to go, but simultaneously i’m questioning it & wondering why i’m paying so much to put myself thru this.

frustratingly cannot eat when i’m anxious, which then means i’m more likely to faint/feel nauseous and just perpetuates the whole thing. i just got back from a work trip to ireland and i feel pretty fried. the idea of being stuck for 8 hrs — plus the 4.5 hrs before of trying to even get to the airport and being on time for check in — and dealing w immigration on the other side is making me twitchy. it should all be fine, i have my esta, but i’m just envisioning feeling so bad by then.

being a bit melodramatic but would love to find a way of easing this anxiety .. i’d take somewhat anxious at least overall visceral twitchy painful panic ? the idea of experiencing this in an instant enclosed space scares me too

i know i just need to take it a little bit at a time — trying to lie to myself and convince my body it’s another short flight to dublin lol — but i’m still !!",anxiety

"is this normal anxiety or iron deficiency/anemia long post!

tbh, the more i think about it, ive never really been a anxious person. up until earlier this year, i never used to stress over anything, like ANYTHING ( i was only 18 ) tests, exams, personal related stuff, just anything. i had my first panic attack after smoking weed and things were pretty normal after that other than me having a few panic attacks bc of smoking weed after that. a little later, maybe for like a week, i had experienced “anxiety” symptoms , like insomnia and was always nervous of having a panic attack but that quickly went away for 5-6 months until october, where i had a random panic/anxiety attack. i had no appetite for like 4 days, only random craving mcdonald’s sometimes and again insomnia for a couple of days. now in november, im experiencing the same thing as i was stressing over problems with my girlfriend, but with worse symptoms. muscle pain, shortness of breath, swallowing air leading me trapped air in my throat, jus generally anxious and again no appetite. the reason im asking if im anemic is because i have symptoms of low iron that ive been experiencing since i was in grade school (im currently 19) . things like cold feet, dizziness when sitting down to long, white spots in my nails etc n they have been getting worse overtime but im not sure if this linked to the reason i acc have “anxiety” symptoms. i booked a doctors appointment for next week, but in the meantime any advice?",anxiety

"Is this normal? I feel helpless, don't know what to do  I'm 23f and have been on and off chronically sleep deprived for almost 5 years now. I went through a traumatic experience from the age of 19-21 and it really affected me mentally and pushed me knee deep into the world of anxiety and insomnia. From the ages of 19-21 I have spent almost every waking hour in anxiety, fear and suicidal ideation. Even in my sleep I used to be anxious and would be violently woken up from the overthinking and fears. 
When the external factors of trauma were over around the age of mid 21, I started really struggling with lightheadedness and overall fatigue, lightheadedness, abrupt heart rates, like it goes up whenever, like my body is in a constant state of stress or anxiety. There will be moments my head is so darn sleepy and IN THE MIDDLE OF SLEEP even my body is in a sleep state but my heart rate would just suddenly go up and every other part of body then has to follow abruptly. Even when I have a physically active day or I'm working out, it doesn't really help my sleep. 
I'm so desperate and feel so sick. 
It's affecting my daily life. My heart beat would go way up randomly, I feel a rush of blood to my head when I get up when I sit down sometimes when I'm just sitting, after heavy work outs or cardio I go mad lightheaded. My bloodwork is all fine. But why do I feel like my body has given up on me. Every day I feel like giving up. I look at the balcony and feel such strong waves of desire to just end it. I feel helpless. I don't even remember what life actually physically felt before I was 19. Is there no way out? Is this normal? Can I ever cure this? Any supplements or protocols that I can follow?

"Chances of cat rabies? I've been taking care of a kitten that was born under my house for about 6 months. His name is Barney, he's very talkative and loves to be picked up and held. He's not my cat (we can't have cats in my house) but he stays around my house. I live in a city where there is a lot of stray kitties. 

Anyways, I have pretty bad health anixety. And barney was kneading my skin and accidently put the tip of his nail in my skin through my pants. It scared me. I am worried about rabies. I talked to my counselor, she said she used to work in the ER and she has never seen a case of rabies with cats. Or even heard of it. She said it's extremely rare, especially for cities. 

He is still eating, playing, and is still very loving but I'm afraid to hold him now and give him love because of my paranoia. I feel so bad but idk what to do. When he sees me, he runs up to me with his tail up and he meows non-stop until I pick him up, then he just purrs and kneads me. 

I came outside to say hi and he was sleeping, when he woke up he was talking a little and he hissed. He didn't seem aggressive though. No body language that indicated he was mad. Right after he hissed, he came up to me with his tail up and started meowing. It just scared me. I know he's a stray cat. So maybe he was just communicating? Or he was mad I woke him up. 
He's not aggressive or anything. He loves to be held and babied. I just scared myself when he hissed.

Again he is still eating and everything.  I don't see any changes in his behavior. 

I didn't even consider rabies until last night, I was on tiktok and I saw a video of a 6yr old who got rabies from a cat licking her wounds? I went to the profile of the page and it seemed fake, but it REALLY got to me. 

Someone please knock some sense into me. I love cats so much but this paranoia is making me scared to even pet him. ",anxiety
"Worried that I somehow lied/over-exaggerated during psychiatric assessment  I’ve been trying to get therapy/assessed/medication/diagnosed for the past few months and finally got an appointment with a psychiatric NP to do an initial intake. 

She ended up referring me to get a neuropsychological assessment but suggested some things I am freaking out about. 

She explained that she thinks I am definitely having depression and anxiety, which I am diagnosed with right now anyways, (so nothing new) but then went on to say I might have a psychotic or bipolar disorder on top of it. 

She didn’t phrase it like “I do have it” or “I think you might have it” but rather “It might be a possibility based on your symptoms but I’m not positive.”

I just don’t know if what I said was too dramatic. I tried to state things exactly as they happened, real things that happened, with my real feelings. 

However some of these things were all the way back in 8th grade and haven’t affected me recently that bad.

Long-term anxiety haver here (10+ years. Diagnosed with GAD, MDD, and OCD). I just got back into therapy because I noticed that my health anxiety had recently crawled back up. I had been body checking like crazy and experiencing all of my hallmark anxiety symptoms (chest pain, muscle soreness, stomach issues, etc), so I decided to schedule an appointment.

The session went great but last night I had a really bad anxiety attack out of nowhere. Maybe it came from mentioning trauma and triggers to my therapist? Anyway, I struggled to sleep but eventually made it to bed around 3am.

"Feeling terrible after resigning  I’ve been at my current job for just over a year and work in a tight nit team of 4. I’ve been doing very well and achieving quite alot for myself in the business.

But I’ve recently made the decision to resign. It came as a huge shock to my boss - I’ve been feeling totally burnt out and exhausted. I wasn’t looking for it, but a new opportunity came up with better hours and better pay which I applied for and got. 

Through all of this, I’ve been struggling immensely with stress from some pretty huge life events. My boss was aware of this but didn’t offer me any resolve. She didn’t offer me reduced hours or time off to help with the stress.

With that, I decided to throw myself into work and started picking up and doing well in my job. But I didn’t realise it was just burning me out more. 

So, I met with my boss this morning before work and confessed that i was leaving - due to the stress and exhaustion - and that I’d found another job to suit my needs. 

Initially, she was just upset and felt for me. Then, she said they’d reduce my hours and give me some time off, and that this would have always been an option. I was slowly starting to come round to the idea but then she said something i didn’t agree with, and her attitude changed. 

She started saying “well if that’s going to make you happy then fine” and “if you’ve seen a better option and don’t want to try with us then fine” and it just felt like she was digging at me. 

I started over explaining why I was leaving and brought up an incident I had with another coworker which happened the year before. Which actually has nothing to do with me leaving. 

So, in the end my boss said to just put my notice in writing and then we would start my notice period. I’ve asked for some garden leave but she doesn’t think I’d be allowed. 


I now just feel terrible after the whole thing. I wish I could rewind and do it properly, but my head is all over the place. I have a long notice period to work, under stress anyway, and now with this added awkwardness. Any advice?? ",anxiety

"Comorbidities Survey [Moderator Approved] I have been looking into common comorbidities and think I have a bunch of things but feeling a bit gaslit as I try to get assessed/treated for any of it.

So out of curiosity I created a survey of things that seem to be common in the neurodivergent population (and/or ancillary populations like MCAS/POTS/EDS or mental health) and I would like to do some data analysis to find connections, dispel myths, etc.

"Rediscovered a huge trigger and idk what to do  I just need some help because idk how to begin working on this. 
I cuddle with my friends a lot, generally I’m the one that likes this the most so I’m always the one the asks them. Ik for some people it’s hard to reject someone directly like that and I’m terrible at picking up subtext and social cues so if someone says maybe in a bit, I can never tell if they’re being genuine or are using it as a way of gently saying no. Because if this I’ll often ask twice and if we are cuddling I’ll routinely ask if they’re ok or they want to move or something. 
Recently, I was cuddling with a friend and I was quite clingy. 
They later told me that they felt uncomfortable and just weren’t as up to it at the time. They also told me that it’s never been an issue before and not to worry about it. 

I have a huge fear or abandonment and the idea that I broke a boundary sent me spiralling and thinking they hated me. I feel like I did everything right, this is really common for us and i asked if they were comfortable several times. Ik both things can be true but im scared I didn’t do enough. I began ruminating on every other time we’d cuddled to try and figure out if they were lying about it never being an issue to make me feel better. 
This all gave me the worst panic attack I’ve ever had, I was vomiting, I couldn’t feel anything and I genuinely  thought my heart was going to pop. 
I talked to another friend about this and they also confirmed it wasn’t that big a deal and that I need to get some help for this. 

I’m scared to talk to the person properly now. I haven’t talked to them about this as I don’t want them to think my reaction is because they set a boundary and I don’t want to scare them off of setting boundaries when they need to. 
I’ve been kind of avoiding them out of fear that they think of me differently now, as if what I did was unforgivable. Im scared to bring it up again I’m case I’m dragging it or something. I just don’t know what to do. This has always been a major trigger for me, a few years ago I was scared to hug people out of fear of making them uncomfortable and I’ve come a long way through exposure therapy snd trying techniques I found on the internet.

I've always been an anxious person, but now it feels almost like my mental walls all crumbled down at the same time and I can't do anything else other than worrying. it's November and it's not as cold as it should be, so the whole ""go out get some fresh air and sunlight"" is making things worse rather than better. 

I'm lucky I live in a walkable city with tons of nature and my uni is on the sustainable side, so it helps a bit. I'm attending lectures to distract myself and it kinda works sometimes, but I also have AuDHD and my attention span is not the best. autism is also worsening my anxiety, I'm empathetic by nature and seeing the state of the world right now is dragging me down. 

I'm sleeping in the same bed as my mother these days, and I dread the moment I'll go back home in the evening because there's nothing I can do without feeling helpless. 

also, I haven't showered in a week (but I wash my body parts separately everyday!) and my hair is a mess because spending 15 minutes in the shower without distractions is a big no-no. I look into the mirror and see a destroyed being.

Will I be fine taking these pills for only 10 days and then stopping, or am I at risk of them fucking up my brain or something or becoming addicted? Sorry if I'm being stupid and overreacting, this kind of thing just makes me really paranoid and anxious (duh)",anxiety
"Am I alone or anyone can relate to this feeling?  I have been experiencing the lose of interest in doing any tasks and even no mood or drive to exercise. I am feeling like this regularly recently, there nothing else to do during these times, but to just wait for the wave to move. So that I can regain the focus back. Pain has become really unbearable with body saying this is too much for me. I feel like I want to cry, but there is agony or anger inside me that wants to scream out loud and smash and break things. I can't even cry or scream... maybe I think I am not in the safe place for these kind of expressions. This makes to question my reality and thought of ""what to fight for?"" comes to my mind.

"Stigma around medication Hi all, 
I’m 23(F) and have been diagnosed with severe anxiety since i was 11, of course i’ve had bad patches and not so bad patches but it’s always been a constant. I have never tried medication due to growing up with a very crunchy dad who was anti-pharma. 
Over the past two years especially my anxiety has taken over my life. I have developed the most insane flight anxiety when i was previously a frequent flyer, I can no longer drive faster than 50km/h and I have had multiple seizures seemingly caused by overwhelm. I also have existential dread and feel like i’m dying or falling all the time. All of my muscles are so fatigued from being so tense all the time, I just can’t take it anymore. 
I really want to go to my GP and tell her i finally want to be medicated, but i’m scared it won’t make anything easier (ironic) or that she’ll start me on a low dose when i genuinely feel like i need to be sedated (can i ask for a higher dose initially? she knows i’m very anxious). 

Anyway, i’d anyone can relate or had something similar plz comfort me as i lay sleepless 🙏",anxiety
Dizziness because of anxiety? Can anxiety and stress cause constant dizziness? Half a year ago I got tested positive for something called MG. All the symptoms I got from this disease caused me alot of stress cause my body never got to really relax. My hair broke off easier and had an easier time feeling sick. I then all of sudden started to get issues with my eyes. When I looked at the floor it felt like it was further away and it felt like I was sometimes floating. Weeks go by and I start getting dizzy daily. In a sense where it feels like I'm walking on boat and my muscles feels weak. Sometimes I will get an intense headache like as I'd I have some sort of tight belt going around my head and pain in my eyes and like behind them and the dizziness will get worse and sounds will sound even louder. Is this all caused by stress and anxiety? I have been at thr doctors office so many times now and get everything checked and they can't see anything wrong. Does anyone else also get daily dizziness from anxiety and stress and how do you deal with it?,anxiety

"Anxiety attack relapse 🥺 Hi! I was diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder last April. I’ve been dealing with this for 6 months. The past few months, I did not have any attacks and I can fully function and even go outside frequently. But last week, I had a vertigo which is my main trigger of my first full blown panic attack. I have this lingering feeling  everyday that I am dizzy even if I am not and just today I had an anxiety attack again. Palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness and irrational fear. Though, the attacks did not last long as I was able to manage it. I know that healing is not linear and that I need to accept the attacks as part of recovery. But, I can’t help but to feel sad because I thought I was already doing fine. Will it get better? How did you cope up with a setback like this? ",anxiety
"How to get settled after moving across the country with anxiety?  To preface: I have anxiety, attachment issues, depression, and a bit of agoraphobia. 

I am currently driving across the country to begin a new job. The job is starting as a 6 month position with the option for extension if it’s the right fit. I have tried moving away from my hometown a few times but I only stayed away for a few months at a time before feeling too anxious about all of it and having to move back home. This is the biggest move I have ever done and I am glad this is just a temporary job in case I really want/need to move back home. But I am still terrified. 6 months feels so long. 

I just got out of a 5 year relationship a few months ago so this will be my first time living alone, and really being on my own. I think this will be good for me to be surrounded by different scenery, etc. to help heal from the breakup. 

My dad is helping me drive out and get set up there for about a week. I am terrified for him to fly home and for me to be there alone. I am so shy and anxious but also don’t like being alone. 

I guess I’m looking for any tips other anxious people have about being far away from home for an extended period of time and how I can make the most of it? ",anxiety
"PVCs worst, when i try to challenge them  Background: I have been dealing with health anxiety and cardiophobia for the past 6 months

Started with chest pains which sent my anxiety into overdrive, i went to the ER thinking I am having heart attack, they did ECG, troponin, chest CT with contrast, and chest xray and cleared me.

After that I followed up with my primary doctor and they cleared me as well after redoing ECG and blood test.

Then i struggled for months and the pain didnt become any better, I got worst pain in chest and shoulder and the got an MRI too for chest, nothing was found, I started getting dizziness, breathlessness, numbness in left hand and leg and Drs kept reassuring me that nothing was wrong and it’s probably anxiety.  I also got stress echo done for my heart and that was fine too 

I started reading anxiety books and doing meditation, I read the DARE book and started applying the principles.


Now the main story, from the past 4-5 days i have been not having any pain or breathlessness or dizziness or any other symptoms but i started getting PVCs, it started with 1 and then it continued during the whole day, I even caught one on my ECG app on apple watch, showed to my dr friend and he said they are mostly harmless

But today, I got it again, and i followed the DARE principle and said ok show me your worst PVCs that you can and it went downhill after it, i started getting more and more of them, it went crazy. i had to standup and go for walk and they calmed down. 
Now my anxiety is back at its peak that something is wrong with my heart.

I am not sure if we can trigger PVCs like that, did someone else had it too?

It comes in bursts, i get it usually for few mins and then it subsides for hours and comes back.

I am really going crazy",anxiety

This has been happening for days or a week maybe and im not sure if this could be due to health anxiety and stress that ive been experiencing after a real cancer scare early october or if its an issue i should get an endoscopy or something for.

"So freaking tired of feeling this way. I am at my wits end with myself. I have been extremely high stress for several months now. Back at the end of August, I worked myself up into an ocular migraine for the first time ever. Since then, I have been hyper focused on my vision and stressed about it. I’ve noticed floaters in my vision that I hadn’t paid attention to before. I work in an office for 12 hour days, staring at a computer in fluorescent lighting and I’ve started to see a lot of quick pin pricks/spots of light in my peripheral vision that make me completely spiral. It happens just about every day that I’m at work, but doesn’t happen as much at home. The fact that it’s every day, sometimes a few times a day really scares me. I’ve been to two eye doctors who say my eyes look perfect. The second eye doctor told me that stress and blood pressure could be causing it. But every time it happens it makes me panic and then I can’t stop thinking about what could be wrong with me. My doctor went ahead and referred me to a neurologist just in case, but my appt isn’t until February. I’m 28F btw. 

I’m so overwhelmed. I feel like I’m going crazy. I know I shouldn’t seek out reassurance but I just want to know if I’m normal or okay. Of course Google has the worst things possible that it could be.",anxiety
"what a strange brain  I have a very strange and uncommon mental issue that most people don’t face. It started when I was 12 years old in middle school, when my classmates and my brother’s classmates used to bully him because of his bad smell. I started focusing on personal hygiene, showering, and using deodorants. What happened was, as soon as I thought about going to school, I would find myself trying to stop sweating completely. But over time, the opposite would happen — I’d end up sweating intensely to the point where I would be in a pool of sweat, facing uncomfortable situations. As the days went by, it wasn’t just about sweating anymore; it extended to everything that went through my mind — obsessive, negative thoughts. I would get these thoughts and physical symptoms about everything I loved. For example, I loved playing PlayStation and competing with my brother to win, but I started getting thoughts that the moment I held the controller, my arm would hurt and become heated, which would happen every time. I’d sit down, and the thought that my nose would swell, enlarge, and become inflamed would trigger an immediate reaction, and my nose would inflame and turn red. Sometimes, from the severity of the pain, it would bleed. The thoughts I get are dynamic depending on the action I’m about to perform, whether it’s talking and interacting with someone, studying, playing sports, driving a car, watching a movie, reading a book — anything I do. This situation is extremely limiting and depressing. I’ve been to more than 25 doctors and therapists, practiced all kinds of cognitive behavioral therapy, and taken every psychiatric medication on Earth, but there has been no improvement or satisfactory result. Even up to this moment, I haven’t been able to get a proper diagnosis for my condition.

In short, my mind is capable of executing any intrusive, obsessive, or anxious thought, as long as this action is within my body’s range. For example, if I have the thought that I’m going to sweat right now, in seconds, I find myself trembling, my heart rate increases, and I sweat heavily as if I’m in a pool. If the thought comes about causing pain in my head and neck, in less than a second, my head and neck tense up, and so on in various aspects of life in a dynamic way depending on the activity I’m engaging in, whether I’m talking and interacting with people, working, exercising, or even eating and drinking. My mind is incredibly strange and evil to the utmost degree, and the worst part is that my nervous system cooperates with it constantly and carries out its commands.

"Is anxiety one BIG umbrella, or many small ones? I was thinking earlier how I have so many different types of anxiety. Social, career, driving, etc. 

That got me to thinking: would all of these be thought of as completely different in terms of focusing on and rectifying? Like one at a time slowly picking each apart? Or would it actually be much more effective to just focus on the topic of helping with my ""Anxiety"" as one big problem that needs solved all at once?

Maybe it doesn't make sense. But it just puzzles me how stuff like social anxiety and driving anxiety could be tied into eachother. It makes sense if you think about it long enough I suppose.

"I'm dangerously scared I may be losing myself, and I feel so alone I honestly don't know where to begin with this. I'm struggling badly to get out of bed, I don't feel like eating, talking, or even socialising with other people, including my own family. Even just the thought of doing these things are causing me to have extreme panic attacks to the point where I feel like I'm dying from a heart attack, or extreme blood pressure.

For a while now, I have struggled with anxiety and depression, have been in and out of therapy, on multiple medications, but I feel like I'm falling further down day by day. I haven't been able to sleep properly for at least 4 years now, at least not at night, and every time I wake up, I have a severe panic attack, which has caused me to feel scared about going to sleep, for fear of having to experience these horrible feelings again. Furthermore, this dysfunctional sleep schedule has caused problems between me and my family, who are starting to notice my issues, and getting frustrated over it, which is pressurising me even further to the point where my symptoms become more aggressive, which I feel is worsening my condition. I feel to scared to even come out of my room, let alone outside, and I can't think of a way out. I also feel that my lack of sleep (or rather proper nighttime sleep, as I often sleep during the day due to worrying all night) is gradually causing me to lose my mental stability and could kill me quite soon, from some illness or disease related to sleep deprivation, as if I didn't feel like I was dying enough already from anxiety alone. 

Another serious concern I have is that I won't be able to find, or keep a job in the future due to my debilitating symptoms, and therefore won't be able to afford a place of my own, or even basic needs such as food or heating. I'm really keen to move out, but not sure if it will ever be possible, due to mental health. On top of that, I'm beginning to feel like I'll never be able to do anything at this stage, not even engage in relaxing or fun activities such as going for walks, eating, or going out with friends. I'm afraid I may even end up homeless due to my illness, financial instability, and problems with my family, who understandably are feeling affected by my lack interaction, but I just can't bring myself to speak to others just now, and I feel pretty misunderstood. All of these difficulties are causing me to feel very alone, and even more ill from my physical symptoms, to the point where I become irreversibly psychotic. Is this likely to be the case in the long run? Has anyone else faced a similar experience? How can I cope with this mental hell?

"Anxiety and stomach issues A few months ago I started to have stomach issues (bad stomach pain and diarrhea). It wasn't that bad because I was still able to live my life. With time it got worse, and I started avoiding taking buses and instead taking the train because it has a toilet (even though I needed to walk 30 mins to the train station). But sometimes taking the train is not an option. Then, everytime I needed to leave the house and be somewhere in which there was not a toilet around I was anxious about it. Commuting, work (Sometimes I'm all by myself at the store and I can't leave to go to the toilet. It is also a very busy place and usually the line to go to the toilet is huge), road trips have been horrible. I started to feel my stomach hurting, and then I started to cold sweat and feel like I was going to pass out. I've been so dependent on Imodium, but it is not all the time that I'm prepared enough to take it before my stomach starts to hurt. Today I had an exam and right at the beginning I felt my stomach hurting, and then I had a mini panic attack. I asked one of the supervisors for help and she talked to me outside of the examination room until I calmed down. Then I went back and it started again. I tried to calm down and breath but my stomach was just not working. I go to the toilet and nothing happens. I finish the exam as quick as I can and go home. 

I had all types of tests done in the GP but no diagnosis. I'm trying to get help from a dietitian, and I'll do an IBS assessment. At first it started as stomach pain that gave me anxiety but now I don't even know what causes it anymore.

I had panic attacks another time I got sick years ago (anemia) and it took me 2 years to ""heal"" from it. The trauma from being sick gave me PTSD, which then resulted in depression and anxiety. It was just such a horrible time in my life, but it was during the pandemic. Now I have a life to live and adult responsibilities and I can't let it take over my life, but it has been incredibly hard.

It is incredibly debilitating, I don't go out anymore, I have to go to work, I avoid going places and just stay home. If I'm going somewhere with other people I rather just go by myself because I can leave the bus/train whenever I want. I only feel safe and calm in places which I know there is a toilet available.

"Panic attacks/PTSD Hey all

I’m a 39f who has been in EMS for 20 years. I have a pretty significant history of personal trauma as well. 
Anyway, I ignored it for years and in the last 2-3 months it’s caught up with me in a big way. 

I had to take a leave from my job. The good news is, I can focus on recovering. 

I’ve tried meds. They haven’t panned out so well for various reasons (SSRI and beta blockers) but I started CBT/EMDR a couple of weeks ago and I am already seeing improvement. 

But, I’m struggling with the whole ‘why can’t I do normal things’ frustration. I have panic attacks in stores, or just thinking about going back to work. Some days my anxiety is bad enough that I cannot even be productive around the house.  

It’s a long and slow process and I am feeling frustrated and defeated.  I feel as though I’m learning to walk again.  So many things I could do easily before are now a challenge. And I feel very broken because of it. 

I could use some pep talks and some success stories.  Especially with people who have chosen to go the no medicine route.

"When I think about getting help I wonder if I'm being dramatic I finished school in 2022 and I'm now 21. Halfway through my last year in school I would make up excuses as to why I couldn't or didn't have to ect. Since leaving I haven't done anything. I haven't gone out to see my friends since 2022 and when one of my friends came to me my hands shook the entire time and I felt a pit in my stomach along with feeling so hot I felt nauseous.

 I haven't been able to go to shop by myself or work and I know that my family thinks I'm lazy and that I ""want to stay at home for life"" as they put it but that's not it. I want to live my life and stop being like this but it feels like it's getting worse. Yes, I dont leave the house unless I'm going shopping with my mum but even that is hard for me. I do go with her to pick my brother up from school which used to be fine but now I have to take public transport starting tomorrow to get him to and from school due to car issues and I'm struggling just thinking about it.

We have enough money issues as it is and I cant afford to be like this anymore. I can't do anything and I feel stuck. It's effecting my life, I cant go shopping bymyself, use public transport, make or take phonecalls or even play games online without feeling horrible. It's gotten to the point where I'll bee fine and then my throat will feel tight at first and then it hurts and breathing is a struggle. I wouldn't call it a panic attack but i assume it's something similar to that?

I have enough symptoms to know it's anxiety or atleast that theres something wrong with me but I'm worried that if I do go to a doctor I'll be told that it's really just me being dramatic and to stop worrying.

I asked my cousin to point it out to my mum after sending her what's happening so I'm waiting for that to happen because I know I wouldn't be able to make an appointment myself but I'm terrified I'm making something bigger than it actually is. I've never been the type of person to cry infront if others or talk about my feelings good or bad and I'm scared of having to have that conversation. Growing up I was incredibly shy (even now) to the point where teachers would tell subs not to call on me and would have a teaching assistant constantly ask if I needed help but I'm not sure if that shyness developed inti anxiety or I'm just blowing me being shy out of proportion. I don't want to be like this

It might sound silly but I'm really just writing this because I want someone to tell me that I'm not being dramatic about it, but no matter how much I think about it it feels like I am.

My only big anxiety triggers have been things like presentations, and even then it’s more “surface level” anxiety where it just feels like bad nerves.

I think all of us who experience chronic anxiety and panic attacks know the difference between “normal” anxiety and the hellish experience of a true, deep anxiety disorder. Today, I woke up feeling normal, and then about 2 hrs into my day randomly had a huge panic attack out of nowhere. This triggered a crazy feeling that I was going insane, that I wasn’t inside my body etc. it also triggered me to have severe stomach cramps, diarrhoea and dry heaving while being unable to eat. 

The problem is, I had work today and had to file an article for a deadline. Multiple people are off sick so I really couldn’t call in sick - plus, I already spoke to my boss (pre-panic attack) and agreed on the work to be done today etc so I didn’t feel like I could call her up and suddenly say I felt unwell. 

I am also studying alongside work and have some immovable deadlines which mean I will need to work over the weekend. Perhaps my high workload at the moment has triggered this anxiety episode - usually I thrive on being busy with work and studying, but I am aware that this could have driven my body to give out. I’ve been sleeping well, eating well (until today) and I exercise most days. 

I’m looking for advice on how to tackle the next few days while I wait for a doctor’s appointment to discuss possibly going on medication. I can’t cancel my deadlines or work - and I think that even if I could, it would be a bad idea to just lie on the sofa doing nothing all day. 

Do I get up early and go for a run tomorrow to try and prevent another panic attack in the day? Cold shower? Meditation? Any tips and advice would be much appreciated.

"Apps to Scroll in Downtime Aside from Social?  I’m an idle scroller in downtime and while I watch shows and movies. The primary apps being IG, Facebook, and Reddit. Following the results of the election this morning, all three have been an apocalyptic echo chamber and my doom scrolling is out of control. I think I need to delete all social apps ASAP until the news calms down but need something to do with my hands so I’m not tempted to redownload. Any ideas? ",anxiety
"anxiety in sales is killing my confidence I have major anxiety, I’m an introvert, and recently got a job. Here’s the thing: in theory, I think this is a great job for me. It feels so fitting with what I want to do and where I want to be. But I have no confidence to approach strangers and sell. I’ve only just started, so I know it might come over time, but god.

I called a client this morning and she got mad at me for calling too early. Other people get annoyed at my emails. I know it’s just part of the job, but every single time it throws my confidence back a million paces. I feel so inferior to my coworkers. Any advice at how to manage and overcome my anxiety in the work day would be really helpful.

I constantly feel like I won’t meet my targets and they’ll can me.",anxiety
"Anyone else feel doom and anixety when spending time alone?  I have a good network of friends and a healthy relationship. I live with my boyfriend who’s out of town for 3 weeks and being alone with my thoughts in our apartment has been tough. It’s hard to put my finger on it but I feel guilty and bad about myself for not making plans to see people as much as I can. It’s like an emptiness that I feel guilty for having, like i’m failing somehow. I feel down on myself for being alone. I find it hard to be comfortable with myself with no other stimulus for some reason. Maybe it’s a biproduct of social media for making it seem like everyone is constantly socialising.

"How to stop perceiving a person as scary? How do I tell my mind and anxiety to stop I have been bullied before. So it obviously stuck to me, have been working on it of course. But at school, I got this little dummy being annoying, he keeps on going because I paid attention to him back in 9th grade. He doesn't know why I was angry he just thinks its funny, he doesn't know it was a trauma response. Now working on myself and growing I understand he is just insecure and wants attention, wants to fit in with others. But I just get fear OUT OF NOWEHERE. I ask myself ""well what can he do??"" , nothing, literally nothing, he cannot beat me up, he cannot tell me anything because I am so amazing, but still I get this anxiety. I notice that when he is alone I don't fear him, I guess I fear that he has ""back up"" when his friend is there and he isn't alone and it again comes from before , they would all gang up on me and I was alone. I really, really want to rewire my brain to see him not as someone scary, because he literally isn't but as a sad guy I should just ignore. Because he gets quiet and small when he is alone , he gets confronted and he shuts up, when he isn't alone he is ""daring and downright disrespectful"" but its fake. What can I do, please I need help. I remind myself how insecure he is but it doesn't help. I also don't want to ve like ""ohh I am better than him"". I just wanna live my life without caring. He doesn't exist to me when I am off school. I want it to be the same when I am there. I get so exhausted with my anxiety ",anxiety

"Too anxious to work Has anyone else experienced this? My anxiety has gotten so bad that it’s affected my physical health so much. I’ve been hospitalised, seeing countless specialists running countless tests, but deep down I feel like it’s just stress triggering my existing anxiety that’s made me so physically unwell. Regardless of my physical health, which I’m getting seen to properly by doctors, I’m also just too anxious to work. I’ve had a good job for 6 months, but it’s a very stressful one. I had a triggering event two weeks ago, got super unwell and now I haven’t been to work for two weeks. I’ll have to either quit, or return soon.

"My anxiety is becoming much worse after huge career switch and I’m scared I’m going to have a nervous breakdown  Hey guys. I’m 30 and have just started working retail for the first time .

I quit my career of over a decade ( Hairstylist) after many years of being treated poorly , labor violations in my salon, and abuse from my clients . I’m currently in school for a history degree and wanna teach when I get my masters. This retail position is temporary / transitional until I finish my degree. 

I basically applied to 1000x of jobs and landed a cashier/seasonal position. The training is non existent and I feel so thrown to the wind . I am a VERY hard worker but the lack of direction in what is wanted from me is making feel violently sick and anxious. The kids who have been training me think I’m a freak because I’m such a nervous energy . 

I go in later this evening and the anxiety is crippling me . I feel like a moron. It takes me longer than the normal  person to catch on with a job that’s so high paced. I see the 18 year old kids breezing through it and here I am, somebody who did customer service work for a decade, about to puke blood. 

My career in the salon was very fast moving and high energy but I also knew what was expected of me and coped. I was a junior manager and was very capable of running the business and managing a huge book of clients . 

I feel like I have NO idea what I’m doing and I’m so scared to make a mistake . 

I’m very blessed to live at home and have my moms support . I am privileged .  

I received a call about a dream job the other day as an instructor - but they only can offer me assistant positions and subbing 10 days a month. 

My mom said if I really can’t handle it I should just focus on the sub teacher position and forget the retail job. It would barely be enough money to live on and pay my bills but she said she wouldn’t care if it meant I could do the subbing and finish my degree in peace . 
 
I am sobbing as I write this because I feel so pathetic and crippled by anxiety.  I thought I had mostly conquered my anxiety issues and was just a nervous person. I never thought I would need to leave my career as a stylist so soon without being fully situated in a school system but things were unsafe at my old job and it was necessary I leave. 

I feel like an immense burden on my mother and I’m ashamed. She’s so amazing and raised me as a widow and I can’t even support her now. I’m 30 and I feel like I failed to thrive . A freaking seasonal retail job is making me sick with anxiety and I hate myself for it. 

I am so scared I will never adjust to being a self sufficient adult. I have always had anxiety issues and prior to this experience I always worked for a mom and pop salon . 

My greatest fear is I am so crippled by my mental state that I am unable to work and need to go through some sort of a disability process . I have a cousin that had a nervous break and went on disability . Her life is awful and I feel like I’m heading that route . She has no real income and lives with her mother in her 50s. I see myself in that. I don’t know how I can be so book smart and poorly equipped for dealing with life? I don’t understand it.  

I need to get back to a psychiatrist but I haven’t been able to find one under my plan . It’s too expensive out of pocket .I formerly did yeats of therapy which helped ease anxiety for me , and was briefly on anti-anxiety medication . I need to resume something to cope.

The month I’ve been out of work I was stressed and unable to relax. I left a really dangerous work situation but am now having to swallow down that choice. I don’t regret it but I don’t have that dependability and stability . The lack of income coming in was a real fire under me and I wasted no time applying . 

I have two jobs now ( the teaching job hasn’t officially started yet) and my retail.  

I just need to be heard so thank you guys . I know I am lucky to have been given my opportunities. I’m not ungrateful- I just can’t cope with the stress and the unknown and feel like a moron / ‘invalid’ of society.   ",anxiety

"Desperate for relief  Sorry this post may be a little long lol. Iv had anxiety for years which wasn’t high anxiety and managed just fine. Times that it was a bit higher I’d get DPDR which I hate that feeling and would take l theanine. But the last 2 days out of nowhere Iv had like severe anxiety and back to back like mini panic attacks. Iv never felt like this before and I just want to feel ok. I had a death in my family last month which triggered my anxiety a bit more and for like a week in the mornings I would wake up nauseous and heart racing but that’s went away and Iv been ok. I went to bed Tuesday night fine but when I started to drift off I woke up in a panic and that kept up the entire night and at one point my heart was racing so bad and my body was shaky. Yesterday I felt ok off and on but also panicky and doom feeling off and on. When it was time to go to bed last night I was already getting anxious because I was worried I wouldn’t be able to sleep which I didn’t sleep much but slightly better then the previous night. My DPDR has been super bad and I hate that and doesn’t help, I just feel like I’m gonna go crazy or something. I know high anxiety can make you feel like that but Iv never experienced this before, and then I scare myself that maybe it’s a heart attack or something wrong. Iv also been very irritable and angry but I know my time of the month is coming so that’s prob why, I also wonder if I could have PMDD because the anger before my period has been like that recently. I’m nervous to try meds cuz of all the side effects but I can’t keep feeling like this. ",anxiety
"Why does kindness and support make me restless? I’m not sure what it is but I just got into a new relationship with my girlfriend and it’s going well. However I can’t help but feel a cold tingling feeling in my chest when she expresses her love with compliments or support / expressing how she cares about me. I used to think it was just me being cutely flustered but it makes me feel restless and sad. 

I was never good looking, atleast until this year I suppose. A lot more people (especially women) compliment my looks, a complete turn around from the rest of my life. I don’t believe compliments, I still accept them and don’t push them away because I like hearing them. Even so I still get that anxious feeling. 

I don’t want to push her away because I love her support and how she cares for my well-being, but I want to be able to do that without crying in disbelief. I was in a relationship before her a few months prior to now with an avoidant person, after a couple months she seemed to distance herself which made me question my self worth. No matter how much reassurance I got from her friends it didn’t help. ",anxiety
"My own mind might destroy my future I'm a first gen student in STEM. I'm graduating soon, and applying to med school, but I feel like every decision I've made in the last two months is slowly killing me.

I tried nonstop to get in involved in undergraduate research to make myself more competitive and after trying hard, I joined a lab that has nothing to do with what I actually want to do. I try my hardest but I feel like nothing I do is enough in research - not even enough for a letter of recommendation. 

I don't sleep well, I went from being well exercised to gaining a ton of weight. I can't even have a day off because when I don't have something due or an exam, I have an obligation at the lab. I'm so burnt out that I can't even function properly. My grades are starting to slip, my research advisors are losing their patience with me, and since I don't have that letter all I can do is sit and watch as the timer for the applications deadlines comes ever closer. 

To make it worse? I feel like I have no support. My own mother scolds me whenever I tell her how anxious I am. My girlfriend couldn't give less of a shit about what I feel.

(and I used some marijuana both times before it happened.) but what was concerning is that I also felt basically complete numbness in my hand, forearm, and my foot (all on one side) and my lips and face felt that way too.

I have heard that anxiety causes tingling/numbness/pinsa and needles in your extremities, but how long does it last? If that ever happens to you? 

  
It lasted all night i think until i got up today. I didn't notice it for about 6+ hours when I got up and then this afternoon it came super suddenly again after i vaped and had a small panic attack.

"1.5 years of health anxiety, hair loss, fatigue, and throat issues - Am I just anxious or is something underlying? I'm a 26-year-old guy, and I've been dealing with health anxiety for 1.5 years now. Previously, I've been on 5-6 different antidepressants, but now I'm down to just one. However, I'm still constantly anxious and worried, always thinking about repercussions. and this health anxiety makes me believe I have some underlying condition or that someone will harm me.

Additionally, I've noticed some physical symptoms:

- Hair loss (not excessive, but when I pull my hair with my hands, 5-6 hairs come out each time)
- Fatigue and non-productivity throughout the day
- Roughness in my throat, needing to make noise from my gland to clear it

I've been trying to quit my antidepressant on my own. When I don't take it for three straight days, I feel my brain working really slow or pausing. When I look around, I feel something unusual, but when I take the medicine the next day, I feel okay.

Google hasn't helped. Researching my symptoms suggests various conditions, including thyroid issues. Reading more about thyroid problems has only convinced me that I have it, and it's saying some scary things.

I'm lost. Is this solely anxiety-driven or is there an underlying condition? I don't know what to do.

"Is this a safe space? I’m so effing depressed and I keep making decisions to make me more depressed. I’m a serial job quitter and no I’m not proud of it. But at my big age I’m just now realizing that 9to5 s just aren’t for me. My mental is not stable. I’ve quit like 5 jobs this year and the last few decent jobs I had were really good to me. Idk why I allow my own thoughts to keep me from succeeding. Instead of taking it in the chin and telling myself im overthinking things I just quit and fall deeper into depression. 

I literally can think back and say I’ve had some decent jobs… (although they were minimum wage). I’ve never had that good government/state job that my parents always wanted me to get. Because everything is about setting up for your future/retirement. All my jobs have been temp jobs/ and retail/restaurant/customer service jobs. I love to cook and I’ve just always been good with restaurant jobs and retail. But the people stress me out then I quit without notice. I feel like my life is going in circles. 

I just want to be proud of myself. I have so many ideas that I start and never finish. My parents both have been blessed with decent situations so they were able to do whatever but had skills. My pops was a sheetmetal construction worker making 40 something an hour and had a Union. He did that for years and got bored with it. He now works in a mental asylum and loves it but hates the hours. They were married but separated before I was born. They both got remarried My mom is more on the artsy side, and had a rough life. She was a bartender for years then married a narcissistic abusive husband and we lived through that for 20 years. I watched my mom go from superwoman to needing me to hold her down. She struggled behind that and I struggled watching her and lost myself because I felt like I didn’t need my own life because my mom needed me. I mean I did stuff but I never went away for school, or moved out on my own. I always lived with someone. 

Anyway my mom and I got a place together and we split the bills. We have both been suffering from depression and we get into it sometimes but we need each other. For now. But me and my serial job quitting ways is getting frustrating my mom is tired of my shit. I always find a way to help out with the bills but eventually that money runs out and I need another solution. We are both talented but have been procrastinating and living in our heads for the past three years. I’m just tired. Mentally and physically. I just quit another job but it was seasonal but I quit it because idek I don’t have a legit reason 😔 and I’m doing doordash to supplement income but my car’s transmission is going bad. I’m so fed up with myself and my life I want more for myself. 

I want to be able to take care of my mom so she doesn’t have to worry about anything. She’s been holding me down while I’ve been stuck in this rut. I watched my little sisters graduate college and the youngest one will be graduating next year. Here I am no degree hella debt and mentally unstable. My one little sister became a nurse and has started a family and everything. My other little sister went to an arts school and the last one will be getting her degree in psychology. My oldest brother can literally build anything and has trades but he’s like me. He quits jobs after he makes a quick $1k then asks everyone for money. But he lives in nyc and is able to find better opportunities out there. We are originally from NYC, but have been living in Jersey for the past 20 years. I love Jersey it has become my safe place. But the opportunities out here are far and few. Which would be a reason for me to stick with something right? I know…. Can someone give me advice please. Oh let me add I also have another job lined up at a warehouse 🙄 I start it on Monday. I took it because it was close by and I’m off on weekends. I just pray I stick with it long enough.

"Doing really bad tonight I decided to go to sleep early tonight because I was up all night last night watching the election. I fell right asleep and it was wonderful. I woke up and thought I'd had a nice long night of sleep and checked the clock to see it said midnight. I drank some water and got comfortable, then it started. I hear loud bare knuckle knocking on my door. For reference, I live alone in a college apartment. But it echos through my whole place. Not overly fast or anything like a panic or someone trying to screw with me, just loud knocking. I immediately pause my sleep sounds and start hyperventilating, hoping they'd left. They knocked again, slower. I finally grab my glasses and creep to my door, open the peephole, and no-one is there. Not at my door, my neighbors, or in the hall I can see. They simply *disappeared*. Usually I can see down the hall a bit or hear movement, neither of those happened tonight. Only two of my friends know where my room is, but they'd always text first and I had no texts. I stood at my door shaking for a half an hour waiting to see ANYTHING through the peephole, nothing. My mind started racing. Was someone trying to scope out my apartment to rob me? Had someone found my vote? (I voted opposite to my very dominated state). Etc. I took apart my smart lock and pulled the batteries so no one can open it and effectively bricked it and barricaded myself in my room, but I still can't get back to sleep.

3. sharp or dull pain in my head. usually my temples. it only last a split second at a time or a few seconds and then goes away. usually only happenes at the peak of my panic attack

4. severe vertigo, especially if i jolt awake out of my sleep hyperventilating. i'll have vertigo the rest of the day or a few days later. 

5. hot flashes, feeling extremely hot as if i'm in the sun or i just ran a marathon.

6. ringing ears

7. my movements feel very odd. i don't know a good way to describe it, but i feel like i'm not aware that i'm moving? or that my movements are uncoordinated or don't make sense? like i feel out of body

8. severe derealization. i literally feel like i'm going insane 

9. this doesn't happen everytime i have a panic attack, but i'll get palpitations or elevated heart rate or both",anxiety

"I'm paranoid all of the time about something Im paranoid somone is using my pictures and pretending it them on social media , even though I've never come across that and don't think thats ever even happened.I am 14 , and I have posted my face when I was looking for online friends , multiple times (I know ,this is my fault, I just need to vent about it) , as I was bored. I received weird and creepy dms before but I just blocked them and went on with my life, but I recently remembered somone messaging me asking to be their friends with images attached which were of a person they were claiming to be. I has a suspicion that it wasn't actually them and I reverse searched the image , which led me to the actual account of the person. Now, remembering thing has set me spiralling and I cant sleep most days. What is somone is using my face? What if some pedo is using my picture to attract younger people? What if my face is linked to something that had nothing to do with me and possible shared on other platforms? I hate the fact I don't think before I do something. If I ever find out that my face has been used in that way or somone else sees something that has nothing to do with me , but my face is there ,I will kill myself. I know , extreme , but anxiety is killing me and Im on the verge of killing myself anyway. I care about how people see me and my reputation, maybe sometimes a bit too much.
Also , this has never happened to me and I'm just having these thoughts.
I am also not diagnosed with anxiety or anything like that , but many people ask me if I'm in therapy and stuff like that when I talk about how anxious I am about stuff that's possibly never happened or never going to happen.",anxiety

"I just want to go to bed Dude it's like 10:40 pm right now, later than what I would perfer to go to bed at. But I'm currently sitting in bed, awake with a really stuffed up nose from crying because when I try to lay down I have a hard time breathing, no matter what position I lay down in. I've had this for a little while now, but a few minutes ago I was a having a mini anxiety episode because couldn't breathe normally without thinking about it too much and I kept getting these stupid freaking heart palpitations (which I've been getting more frequently now and it's pure bullcrap) Anyways, every time I get that darn flutter or sudden thump in my chest, I panic a little because of course I think it's serious when it's apparently normal but of course I still worry about it because I have horrible death anxiety. Let me put a little more context in here, this all started when I layed down on my side while watching TV and started to feel a little antsy for some reason. Then I kept accidently breathing irregularly which made my blood pressure rise a little since I wasn't taking full breaths. So that caused me to start feeling light headed and shaky which resulted in my derealization being triggered by the stress of not being able to stop this. I tried to calm myself down but it wasn't going away, so then I got myself irritated and worked up because I couldn't calm down enough to go to sleep. Then that's when I started crying and my heart palpitations kicked in for about a minute and it started to worry me so that made me cry even more. I tried to ground myself and take deep breaths through my mouth because my nose was too clogged up. Right now I feel better but I still have derealization.
 (Sorry, this was a very messy rant. I suck at neatly explaining things. I just don't want to feel alone right now)
[Side note: I looked up trouble breathing when laying down and it mentioned heart disease which, my fault, I looked it up on Google which was a stupid idea, but of course that wasn't a pleasant thing to see. Another source said it was because of my anxiety which calmed me a little, but i still even have slight trouble breathing laying down even if I don't have anxiety so I don't really know]",anxiety
"displacement anxiety / health anxiety. I wanted to mention this because a lot of people deal with health anxiety but recently I noticed that my health anxiety is more of a displacement anxiety. There have been major anxiety inducing situations going on in my personal life recently and randomly when I am worked up about it I’ll start noticing symptoms that I have daily and will hyperfixate on them until I relax or ignore what has me anxious. My therapist mentioned that she also feels like it is displacement anxiety but I’m not one to have health anxiety on the regular, only when under pressure. 

Today I noticed the displacement anxiety going from being stressed over major events in my country lol to suddenly noticing that I’m getting chills and that I’m very close to getting a tension headache if I don’t relax. But to me can you guess what my health anxiety thought it was? Meningitis.

"is this normal???  hello! im an 18 year old (F) and i think that i suffer from anxiety, which is very weird for me. 

my anxiety/panick attacks started in spring when i was going through an exhausting and stressful period of time (dance competitions, exams, theater, school) i barely had time for myself but that was normal for me. i usually know when these periods of time are about to come and its been this way for many many years now, but only this year i started having panick/anxiety attacks.

they started off at night the second i turned off the lights and went to bed i started feeling like i couldnt get enough air and how my heart starts racing. my mum could feel my heart racing aswell so we went to the doctor and told me that there s nothing wrong w my heart besides the fact that i have systolic murmur (idk if its called this way but its basically one of my valves doesnt close enough) its not a big deal, most people have it and it only causes the heart to beat faster for 2-3 seconds, nothing harmful tho. 
they gave me a natural med that makes me fall asleep faster and calms me down (its with melatonin, valerian and some vitamin) sometimes it works other times it doesnt. 

summer came by and i eventually got over these attacks i could still feel the sensation of not getting enough air but i didnt think much about it so it didnt develop into an attack until i literally forgot i had all these. 

in august i went for 10 days on vacation w my boyfriend and on the first night we ate some chocolate (right before bed) which made my heart GO CRAZY so when we turned  all the lights off i started shaking and twitching i vomited i went to the bathroom several times and i was in a full blown panic attack. it ended up w me doing respiration exercises w my boyfriend and then i js fell asleep. the other nights i was js scared to go to sleep but i took that natural med that made me fall asleep so it was all fine. 

a month ago i slept over my bf s house (it wasnt the first time, i had slept there many times) and it all went well until we turned off the lights and i started shaking and twitching again, i was freezing cold, i vomited again so while he went to make me a hot tea he gave me the task to choose 1 good tiktok out of 10 lmao, so i did that, i got under the blanket (like fully) and started watching tiktok which made me completely forget what ive been through, i wasnt cold anymore and eventually he came to bed and we both fell asleep. 

last week i went to greece and again, i was very tired on the first night so while i was waiting for my bf to get out of the shower i almost fell asleep (i cant sleep with lights on), the moment he came to bed and we turned the lights off i started shaking and twitching, i could feel anxiety and stress in my chest  and then after some time my heart started racing. we eventually called his parents. his dad gave me a med that was supposed to slow down your heart rate but i didnt take it knowing that i dont have real heart problems and then his mum came over the bed and started talking to me in general telling me stories and i eventually fell asleep with my heart racing, bpm didnt go down. 

days going by during the day i was very anxious about going to sleep so then again i could feel anxiety and stress all over my body and i was just very scared. at night i took again that med before going to sleep i was anxious but all i did was watch tiktok which made me forget everything and fell asleep. 

when i came back home sleeping and anxiety wanst a problem anymore. i really need help idk if all of this is normal and i want to solve this issue by myself i cant go to a specialist and if i tell my mum she ll get very scared (also writing all this made me feel a little anxious again) ",anxiety
"I need other people's opinions. Requesting a reality check I feel like my anxiety might just be shifting to a different form instead of getting ""cured"". This will be a bit of a long post, so believe me, I'll be thankful for anybody that reads and comments.

For background information, I've been a typical failure-to-launch sort. Major depression and anxiety since late high school. Graduated college in late 2019 without a clue what kind of career I wanted. I couldn't even get job interviews after hundreds of applications. Put on tons of weight. I would try a med and find it only smoothed the lows of my depression but never gave me a kick. I did get some work as a public employee for 8 months in 2023 but I didn't like the job, and felt guilty for doing so. 

I got so sick of where I was heading in life that at the end of March I committed to weight loss, and am glad to say I'm down 70lbs. I got a mood high in September and knew that if I wanted it to last, I needed to grab on and not let go. I went and saw a psychiatrist in person for once (instead of online general practioners thru plushcare). 

I'm now 6 weeks in on fluoxetine and 3 weeks on trazodone and after some soul searching, I could fucking cry about how much my mood has changed for the better. I actually know, *really* know what I want out of life now, career wise and dating wise. I've been energetic and happy before in early high school, but I've never felt such a radiant clarity in my entire life. I want to get out of my parent's house ASAP and have been applying for the bottom level jobs in a field I like and plan to work my way up. I don't care if it takes a year or two of low paying grunt work. I want my own life, damn it!

I think my depression is entirely gone at this point, but I still have anxiety, though I think its from a healthier place. I used to play video games a lot as it was the only way I could feel things in the depression malaise. Before my mood high in September, the anhedonia from my depression was hitting hard and I couldn't even get that release anymore. I'd just feel guilty and worthless and stare a screen, listlessly clicking around. 

This is going to sound insane, but I'm legitimately concerned there's something wrong with the fact that, by myself, I can't play video games or watch TV for more than an hour or two without getting an ""ick"". I'll get up and go clean something, or do chores, or work on some plan for my future like a budget, look at apartments around town on zillow, etc. This morning I drove my folks to the airport, came home and went on my morning walk, went to the pharmacy, made a spreadsheet for workouts, then went grocery shopping. Have had very little desire to touch the TV or video games all day. It's not the same miserable, zombified stewing from the past, but still.

I can't help but feel I'm ""broken"" with regard to that and it's kind of concerning. I still enjoy some game time with friends after dinner for a few hours after dinner, but all the single player games I used to play and love have very little allure anymore.

"Anyone have objective resources for coping with election results? As someone not very in-the-know about politics, it's a very difficult circumstance right now to get **non-biased, consice and factually supported information** on what to expect in the next four years with the new results.

The spectrum of doomposting ranges from ""nothing changes, states have more power than ever, and presidents are only ever occupied undoing each other's work etc."" to ""bombs are dropping and the climate is done for yada yada.""

My anxiety works best with acceptance but right now I don't know what to be accepting, and I feel like that's what is letting it run amok. I'm not expecting some clairvoyant prophecy, just an article or video that helps hone in on the predictable expectations, big or small, detailed or simply put, doesn't matter as long as it fits the bill.

"How do I win the battle against catastrophizing?  I’ve been struggling with this for a long time now. In every situation, my mind concludes that the worst possible outcome happened, convinces me, and I start to full on panic because of it even though I have absolutely no evidence that this outcome is even real. 
For example, if my friend hasn’t been online for a while: my brain concludes something horrible happened and I panic until I’m able to reach them again. 
Someone left me on read: they hate me now for some reason and never want to talk to me again. 
My mother is late when coming home from work: something bad happened on the way.
What is worse is that my mind actually manages to convince me that these thoughts are reality and I start to suffer because of them. I even consider situations that I start to believe will happen years from now and I feel anxious when in reality those will probably not even happen. This gives me, aside from the panic, physical symptoms. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I vomit, I struggle to breathe…all because of scenarios from my mind that aren’t even true. 
Deep down, my brain knows that the assumptions are not true. But my panic speaks louder and I can’t really focus on anything else. My mind is like this 24/7. I feel like I’m going crazy. I’m exhausted. I’ve tried everything. I can’t get rid of this. What do I do? I need help. ",anxiety
"I have anxiety quitting my job Please give me the courage to quit my job. I hate my current job but I feel guilty quitting cause I started 3 months ago. 

Overall, the negative of the job is my boss. She scolds us when we make mistakes and can be demeaning, as if she is speaking to someone she thinks is inferior. Over the past month, I have been scolded or called out by her 4 times. I can’t tell you exactly if it’s my fault or her fault I’m making mistakes. What I suspect is that I’m not understanding the instructions she gives me the way she intends them to. So, she gives me instructions and I follow them, just for her to tell me I followed them wrong and didn’t do as she asked. It makes me feel hopeless because I am genuinely trying my best, but every assignment I hand in to her gives me anxiety because I’m afraid that I understood her wrong and she’ll scold me.

It’s gotten to the point where I’m crying almost everyday because of the stress and anxiety. I dread going to sleep and waking up for work. I dread receiving emails from her. I dread seeing her. On days that I work from home, I’ve noticed I cannot will myself to get out of bed because of how much anxiety I feel. So I would just work in bed because I don’t know what else to do.

Seeing today how my boyfriend, while home for his lunch break, had to make lunch and carry it up to me in bed to make sure I’ll eat, was the last straw for me. This is not who I am, nor who I wanted to be. I didn’t used to be like this. I don’t want the people I love to see me like this. So I want to quit before my mental health tanks even deeper.

But now that I want to quit, I feel guilty and anxious about telling my boss. I already have anxiety about interacting with her. Please give me courage to go through with this.",anxiety

"important exam.. why can't i let myself be sick? bit of a crisis Today I had to sit two very important english papers. From the minute I woke up something felt off, like the way I feel before I throw up. I ignored it, knowing I had a couple of hours left to revise. I sat in the exam hall, my stomach beginning to churn - nerves I assumed. I began my first paper, choosing to handwrite as my exam log ins weren't working, and got around halfway through before I got incredibly hot, short of breath, blurry vision, intense nausea and dizziness. I knew how important this exam was so finished my first paper with everything I had. I opened my second paper, feeling exhausted and sick already, and noticing that it was harder than my mock exam but deciding to give it a go. Now, at the beginning of the exam the supervisors said that if anyone felt unwell they should let someone know. I also knew that where I live if something happens my mock exam grade could be used if I had to leave or was deemed no longer fit to take the exam. My head felt considerably light, and I knew if I wanted a high grade I was going to have to push so hard to get myself around the questions. Because my mock exam grade is relatively high (20/24) and the vomit feeling was rising in my throat and I just couldn't write anymore. I knew if i stayed there my high grade would become a fail, and I would've pushed myself through for nothing. I am not the type to make split decisions, but I am scared of vomiting. I just couldn't anymore. I was too hot, the room was spinning. I put up my hand and before I knew it I was asking the supervisor what happens if I'm too sick to continue. I was taken outside for water and still felt bad, and decided I couldn't sit the rest of the exam. I've made an appointment with my doctor because in order to apply for my mock exam grade I need to get a medical note. Now that I'm feeling a bit better I have this awful feeling that I did it on purpose, and I'm a terrible person who took the easy route out to get a good grade, because once I was taken home I felt such relief and happiness that the whole ordeal was over and I could just sit and feel bad comfortably. Like maybe the exam was too hard and I was just lazy. But I also know that if I stayed in there I would do incredibly badly because I didn't have the ability to think straight to do the harder questions, and I would have failed and my future would have suffered, and derived grades are for the purpose of incidents such as mine. As you can tell I'm not usually the type to just quit on an exam (unless its algebra) and I'm being very hard on myself for giving in and giving up. Please give me some insight on your opinion so my brain stops fighting. 

TLDR: I felt I couldn't sit an exam due to sickness so chose to go home and stick with my high mock grade rather than failing, and now I feel like I lied and am a cheat. ",anxiety

"My depression and anxiety are taking over and it feels hopeless (TW: mentions of drug/ alcohol abuse and miscarriage)  Struggling with depression and anxiety it all seems hopeless 

Massively struggling with depression 

I’m 23 y/o and this feels like it has been the most difficult year of my life. 

- I have been battling with a drug and alcohol addiction, and I am managing to stay off drugs now and I am slowly lessening the drinking. 

-I have suffered two miscarriages both to a man who doesn’t want to be with me but has been there for me through a lot. 

- This man has lived with me for the past year and although it hasn’t been easy, I love his company. He is now moving out to his own place and I feel like he is going to abandon me now.

- I am really struggling with debts but I am communicating with a debt help company who are mitigating this for me and I am paying whatever I can every month to help resolve this but it just seems like a never ending cycle. 

- I work two jobs that have been on my ass due me taking a prolonged/ long period of sickness due to me being chronically ill as well as the miscarriages traumatising me both physically and mentally. 

- I have been in and out of the doctors for the past 6 months and I am currently getting psychological help for my poor mental state 

- I am very distant from my family as they are dysfunctional and contribute massively to my mental illness from when I am around them and I have distanced myself from a lot of friends this year for not respecting my boundaries.

- I live with a roommate who used to be my best friend but we are just tense with each other all the time now because she also did not respect my boundaries and has flirted/ tried it on with every guy I have been with and found out she has taken advantage of people when intoxicated as well. 

I am 23 years old and I already feel like I have massively fucked up my life, I live in an apartment I can just about afford but the debts, jobs, illnesses and everything else is all weighing on my mind and I feel like I’m dealing with it all on my own.

I’m considering a change in career path (I currently work an office job and bartend on evenings/ weekends) working in either event organisation online or becoming a tattoo artist as my current jobs make me miserable and contribute to my illnesses whereas a career change into those two would really help me mentally as they have both always been a hyper-fixation of mine.

"Adrenaline rushes over the littlest things I've (F28) been suffering from panic attacks for a decade. Since I started having panic attacks, I noticed that when I slightly exert myself, move around slightly fast, or turn my head a lot, I get a bit dizzy and experience a weird adrenaline rush like I just finished a marathon. Tingling in legs, weird head buzzing, sensitivity to light, shortness of breath, tightness in chest that sometimes feels like pressure or a weird bubble, rapid heartrate, and depersonalization lasts up to an hour or two. My brain feels like someone shook it up.

Usually this gets triggered by little things like mopping the floor at work or vacuuming the house. It's somehow very mentally overstimulating for my brain, and I don't understand how or why. Then when I get in the car, I'm over the edge and so overstimulated at that point that I often start having a panic attack and struggle to catch my breath.

I don't workout, but I'm not sedentary. My job requires me to be on my feet and walk around a lot, and at home, I'm normally chasing after my toddler or cleaning. Not overweight.

Does anyone else experience this or have any explanation? Like, I just don't get it. I don't feel like I should walk and work like a sloth just because my brain is so hypersensitive",anxiety

"Looking for advice Hi there! I’m looking for advice or to know your experiences with procrastinating because of being so overwhelmed with having a noisy head while trying to work on anything. People often say: don’t think just do it/ 5 seconds rule/ start and you’ll build momentum/ eat the frog/ quit the illusion of perfectionism/ use the pomodoro  technique. While all these are great suggestions, they still don’t work for me because my problem is the inability to focus on the task from the non-stop fearful thoughts. It feels like multitasking between working on the task and trying to quiet my brain or respond to the persistent anxious thoughts (which a lot of the time sound rational and worthy of attention so, I always fall for it). My fear response slows me down so much, I don’t know what to do about it!! All of this creates quite a stressful, resulting in a feedback loop that makes me chronically procrastinate and conclude that I’m incompetent. I’ve been like this for many years and it’s starting to get worse. Nothing has worked. Body doubling helps only a little and not all the time. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and CPTSD and have been doing therapy and taking meds for many years yet. I haven’t gotten any better with procrastination and I’ve been so frustrated about it all, to the point that I’ve gotten depressed because I continue to resent myself for being incompetent. 

I’m open for feedback and would really appreciate receiving advice on the matter. Thx!!",anxiety
"Is clumsiness a part of anxiety? Hey yall, so I’ve had terrible crippling anxiety pretty much my entire life, and I’m also literally the clumsiest person on the planet. I’m just wondering if anyone else is like this and how closely related clumsiness is to anxiety? Like it’s actually so so bad and it honestly just makes my anxiety a hundred times worse because I embarrass myself so often and I can’t help it. For context, my anxiety is mostly social-related and I recently moved away to college about a month ago. Ever since then, my clumsiness has gotten much worse. I frequently knock over drinks, trip over things, move too fast without thinking which causes things to fall apart. I break things without meaning to. My boyfriend is an absolute gem of a person but I feel so so bad because he’s constantly cleaning up my messes due to my clumsy behavior. I can tell that he’s getting a bit annoyed as well which is totally understandable, I would be annoyed too. At first my clumsiness was kind of cute and funny like those quirky girls in the movies that have clumsy behavior, but now I just feel like an idiot and a total embarrassment. I think it’s largely related to my anxiety because I notice that when I’m by myself, I’m actually a very efficient and coordinated person, but once I get into a social situation, it’s game over. The brain is so weird, I don’t even totally get it because I play violin which requires extreme coordination and attention, and I’m pretty amazing at it, I’ve been playing since I was six, so like why is my coordination so good when I do that but so terrible when I’m doing much simpler things?",anxiety
"On vacation not trying to ruin it, need help.

"I can’t even drive my car anymore 

Uk based:

I’ve had anxiety since I was about 14 years old (now 30F). But ever since 2020 it has completely spiralled. I now have bruxisim (teeth grinding) that’s come from my anxiety and that’s a whole other issue and a very expensive one. 

I have never felt very supported with my MH. My parents don’t believe in what they can’t see, I’m sick of people telling me to ‘just get out the house and go for a walk you’ll feel better’ ‘do this you’ll feel better’ nothing makes me feel better. 

Years of therapy, cbt different antidepressants. Taking vitamins, b12 shots.

Last month I rang my doctors surgery in a crisis.
They rang me back same day and I just cried to this doctor on the phone. I told her I don’t want any ssris as they make my bruxism x10 worse. So she said try propanol? 3x a day. But this is for the physical symptoms. Which in a panic I do get. But I just want to not have to build up to the panic mode.

I haven’t driven my car in over a year. I’m now petrified to drive. (No idea why brain just told me one day I can’t drive so now I physically cannot force myself into the car)

Socially, awful. Hate it.
If there’s a big event, wedding/christmas/birthday/celebration anything out of routine. I go into overwhelmed melt down. My brain fog is off the chart. I have two little boys and I just feel like I absolutely suck and I’m failing them so badly.

I always put them first no matter how bad I feel I get up, be a mum. Drop them to school pretend to be the happy smiley ‘got it all together’ mum. 

I had a business 4 years ago. I was so independent. Although I’ve always struggled with anxiety it’s never been so triggering and irrational as it is now. It makes me so sad and so lonely.

I think to some degree I've had some level of anxiousness for most of my adult life, circulating around life responsibilities, things passing me by too fast (window for having kids, starting a real career, funding retirement, trying to buy a house, etc.). A little over a year ago I got a job with way more responsibility, and without going in to too much details about my boss and work life, it causes a lot of stress. 



Within the last 4 months, I've had serious health issues including debilitating brain fog, inability to focus, fatigue and lack of motivation. This seems to be worse when I'm in situations I'm uncomfortable, or on days with high stress. 



I've done bloodwork panels chasing a dozen rabbit trails thinking I'm on to a physiological explanation to what's wrong with me, but everything says I'm as healthy as an ox. I did notice caffeine made it worse, so I cut out caffeine entirely. However, somedays are worse than others and it's still severe enough for me to question what's going on.

  
I have gone through bouts of thinking I have brain cancer, thinking I'm just ""bound to die"" at this point, which as a 30M I know is not a normal thought process but I can't help shaking it because these last 4 months have been grueling. 

  
All this to say, it makes me wonder if I've lived with anxiety to some extent for a long time, and now with this added responsibility it's adding up and overtaking my mental health.

First time poster, long-time lurker. Also have dealt with a slew of different types of anxiety in my life…now it’s just focused on a fear of becoming pregnant.

My (32F) husband and I had protected sex on 10/14ish (day 14) of my cycle, and according to my app (which I know isn’t positively reliable) I was set to ovulate on day 17. We used a condom and there didn’t seem to be any tears or anything like that. 

Today 11/06 I’m about 3 days late on a generally predictable cycle (usually 31-33 days, I’m on day 37) with horrible panic attacks and anxiety. We had a negative pregnancy test yesterday (11/05) morning and I think I’m going to take another this evening just to ease my mind.

It’s  important to note that I already experience pregnancy anxiety almost monthly, since having our first child early 2023 and having a heartbreaking slip that resulted in a termination shortly after our first was born. That was my only abortion. I do talk to my therapist about it and my partner is super supportive.

Also, it was a heavy month with stress (horrible coworker issues and the death of a close family friend, including interacting with family members I am low contact with as a result). And I also started using nicotine products again as of this month.

Honestly, I’m really scared right now. We are a stable happy couple, but I don’t want to have another child for a couple years…I want to give my boy all the attention I have, for deep reasons I won’t get into here. 

Looking for some reassurance! Thanks in advanced for the insight.",anxiety
I am a mess. My anxiety is so high i am on the edge.  I have waves of nausea.  I desperately want to throw up.  I feel a full on panic attack coming on.  I don't feel safe.  My brain knows I am but I can't escape this feeling. I want to believe this will pass.  I am terrified.,anxiety
Gabapentin Anybody else prescribed Gabapentin for anxiety? My psychiatrist put me on 100mg capsules. He said take 1-2 every night but I see other people mention taking this drug multiple times throughout the day. Any thoughts? I don’t  have issues with sleep at all and I figure if I take it at night then it negates the point of relieving my anxiety during the day.,anxiety
Depakote and seroquel potentially causing problems  Ive been in and out the psych ward the past two months and been prescribed depakote twice a day (1000mg total) and seroquel 100mg. I haven't been acting normal in forever. I feel like I can't even have proper emotions. I dont know how anymore. It's great I don't feel suicidal anymore but I can't feel true happiness bc that's dull too still. And the anxiety is hanging on like a demon. I want to be ok so I try to mask. I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow at 9:30 even tho it feels pointless... At times I shut down and completely space out. This can't be a normal thing. I can't live my life like this. I can't even go out and be social without feeling intense dread,anxiety
"My biggest fear is coming back and I can’t take it anymore This is going to sound weird. I already know it but stay with me. 

I (m) have always had a weird fascination yet fear of missing people, murder, crimes, lost media. I don't know why it can scare me and intrigue me.

I don't know when this started but it must have started by the latest 4 years ago when I found out about people who had been missing in my area, as well as Steve Irwin's passing. Another one of my fears is finding someone behind my shower curtain who is out to kill me. Combine these two things together and I was once afraid of showering. I would only shower if someone was the on the second floor of my house where my shower was. I think I out grew this fear by playing music while showering. I believe this gave me a false believe that someone was in the bathroom protecting me.

I don't know when the fear stopped but it at least stopped 2 years ago. But know, I have slowly stopped playing music in the shower because I had blocked out the fear.

But with recent events in my life. And once again finding out about missing people like Amy Lynn Bradley & Brandon Swanson. I'm slowly starting to get the fear again and I don't know what to do about it. With stuff like B.O. I can't not shower. I honestly don't know what to do.",anxiety
"Dealing with frequent anxiety attacks I've never been diagnosed with GAD, but have always been an anxious individual, after deciding to work on my mental health I was diagnosed with ADHD earlier this year, and heavily suspect that I may be Autistic 

I've been on medication for about 5 months now, and alot of my anxiety around work, performance, self-image etc. etc. have kind of been nipped in the bud, I rarely ever get anxious waiting for things like packages, appointments, meetings etc.. 

Anyways, whilst it has fixed that medium grade anxiety that just used to linger in my chest and throat all day long, I end up turning into an anxious ball of mess as the medication wears off - This doesn't happen every day, and it has been happening less and less but I've given up on trying to figure out what exactly triggers it. 

Sometimes, if I don't eat I don't get any anxiety, sometimes I do - I have never, ever had this type of anxiety until I started medication, its a very ""manageable"" anxiety, i.e if I pay attention to my heart rate, I can see it go down a little at times, or if I keep myself occupied, but more often than not I will start looking at my heart rate and as a result cause my anxiety to sky rocket even more. 

There's no clear 1 thing that triggers it, life over the past few months has been pretty stressful, and its natural to have some type of anxiety surrounding current life events, but this is completely different - I could be having a great day, and out of nowhere I will end up crashing because of my medication and then need to figure out ways to remedy the crash. 

I know this is largely related to my medication wearing off, but I find it odd that I get the exact same kind of anxiety when I eat sometimes 

My doctor suggested I either take Xanax or Propanolol, I'm hesitant on taking either in the interim as I'm wondering if there are larger lifestyle changes I can make that will help with this. 

Any tips/suggestions would be helpful, thank you!",anxiety
"It’s getting out of hand.  So for the last 3-4 days I’ve been having major panic attacks leading to nausea, headaches, stomach aches and in general the most horrible discomfort I’ve ever had in my entire life. I rarely ever have anxiety and it’s never been this severe before for me. But it’s been getting so bad that I have been crying and screaming for hours on end. I am now in the hospital and have trouble falling asleep I am currently experiencing a level 1 anxiety not enough for it to be a panic attack but I’m still not sure what to do. It’s been going on for so long and the pain is absolutely unbearable it feels like I’ve tried everything I feel absolutely hopeless. I haven’t been able to sleep much at all unless I get so absurdly exhausted from all the crying and screaming that my body just stops functioning and puts me to sleep. I can’t live like this and I need help. I can’t put myself in the mental hospital because I need to be on my phone 24/7 (the only one close to me doesn’t allow phones)  so I don’t go completely insane. If I don’t have somebody to text me or have a game to play or a meme to watch I start thinking and whenever I start thinking I get anxious and then all these horrible things happen to me. But when the panic attack happens I am completely hopeless and have nothing to cope with it. It goes on for hours and hours on end of just crying screaming and throwing up when all I want is just to sleep. If anybody knows any techniques I can use to help or any suggestions or solution I am more than desperate. ",anxiety
"Experiencing a pretty bad anxiety hangover right now Been non-stop for the past two weeks, didn't really rest at all over the last weekend and honestly have been feeling pretty good anxiety wise as of late but yesterday evening as I was leaving work exhaustion started to set it. That coupled with the election, I barely slept at all and my body felt so exhausted and nauseous. IDK how to describe the sensation other than ""icky"" my body just felt icky all over kinda like chills. This morning woke up and was nauseous so I decided to call out of work, choke down a piece of toast and lay in bed some more. Sitting on the couch now but feeling wiped out and my anxiety is spiraling a bit: is this going to last a long time? is it some sort of virus or bug? what if this is what I have to deal with now? etc. Trying to stay in the present and avoid the what ifs but damn is it hard today.

"Prodromal phase of schizophrenia  I'm not looking for a diagnosis but I've been dealing with these paranoid thoughts for a few months now that I know I don't believe but they are constantly there like people plotting against me or trying to harm me or like the fbi is watching me I know these are crazy and again I don't believe these but it all happened because of the fear I was developing schizophrenia so I started researching about it and saw what people thought with this illness thought and started thinking the same stuff I suffered from harm thoughts before this and religious thoughts before this new obsession and this one has been the biggest one yet I've talked to 2 therapist and they both said I'm not but like when I was researching it said people in the prodromal phase have insight and then they go into there psychotic episode so I'm really scared that what if that's me and I have insight right now but tomorrow or next week I will fully believe these delusional thoughts 
And with these paranoid thoughts I'm not scared of the actually thought like I know people are trying to kill me but it's like I get the thought and I'm like noooo I don't believe this but what if I actually end up believing it and I get anxiety attacks from them cause it's like since I'm thinking about it do I believe it?

"Feels like I'm having a heart attack I know I'm probably not, but since yesterday I've been having chest pain on and off, accompanied by jaw pain, weird heart beats from time to time and pain in my left arm, all the symptoms of a heart attack, but I don't think it is. I've been completely psyching myself out since it started happening and I don't know what to do.


I don't understand why I'm stressing about this so much, and any help on how to stop worrying about it and settle my nerves is greatly appreciated. I have a history of anxiety and I'm not on my meds right now so that's definitely a factor, but i don't understand why I'm showing all of these symptoms, it's stressing me out and I can't stand it. As said before, any help is appreciated",anxiety

Worrying about starting with a new therapist  For the last 4 years I’ve had the same therapist and recently finished my sessions with her a few weeks ago. The other day I signed up for a new therapy program but I’m not sure if I am making the right decision. I ended with my therapist mainly as he specialised in working with children/teens and I have kind of out grown him and I think he also believed I was doing alot better than I actually am. (Not sure if this is normal but I started just lying to him towards the end not sure why). I have now got an appointment with a new therapist in a few days and I am so worried that I am just being dramatic and I am better and I’m wasting these people’s time??? Just not really sure as when i first started therapy it was for quite a specific reason and now I feel like there’s nothing specific Im just so stressed!!! Not really sure if this makes any sense but im kinda spiralling… ,anxiety

"Shame is a form of stress and can cause Anxiety! Back around 9 months ago I used vapes on and off over a 6 month period. Since then, despite me being a very mild asthmatic, every time I get even an ounce of chest pain, I constantly think I have some form of lung disease or cancer. I have had a chest x-ray and had two doctors listen to my chest and confirm that I’m all okay! They did find some nodules but they are apparently extremely common, regardless they ordered a CT, which I have been waiting about 4 months for and I still haven’t had even a letter about it.

My anxiety over the last say 5 months has been extrem, ending in 2 A&E/ER visits, one for my heart and one for my lungs, both of which came back fine! Despite this I still at time feel like something is really wrong, and I think a lot of it is to do with the fact I can’t forgive myself for even touching a vape to begin with! I just feel so stupid for falling into that trap and now I’m paying for it mentally. ",anxiety
"First time Man so for the first time a few days ago I had a anxiety attack. Like a BAD one. Had to get taken to the emergency by ambulance and they sent me home that day. 
        I’ve been dealing with the anxiety of it all for the last few days and today is the worst day and now I’m at the ER again. This time my mom and dad drove me.
        This is worse than any physical pain you could feel. Because this mental pain makes physical pain. I am currently sitting in the ER listening to one of my favorite podcast waiting for my doctor to come hopefully give me something that will make my days easier. 
         I’ve always been a fan of twenty one pilots and I’ve always heard Tyler Joseph’s(the lead singers) fights with anxiety and and for some reason I always connected with him and now I understand why. If you guys have any tips on how to calm down or just good things to say please do.

Getting out of bed has become a chore Almost every day I dread getting out of bed. I wake up sick to my stomach worrying about having to go to work. I just started not too long ago at my first job as a cashier. The place is ok. The people are nice enough. But I’m not ok. I worry every single day about going in. Then when I get home I’m exhausted and worry about having to go back. Even on my days off I worry about going in. I disassociate to the point of where I don’t remember things. I am autistic and anxiety ridden. My brain is constantly thinking about negative things even when I try not to. I just feel mentally and physically drained. I don’t know what to do at this point because it feels like I have tried just about everything. From over the counter meds to counseling. And while they help in the moment they don’t help in the long run. I feel like I am just dragging by without much of anything to look forward to. The only reason I even try is my family. But I’m just tried at this point.,anxiety
"How do I stop obsessing over romantic relationship Hi everyone,

Was originally going to post this in r/relationshipadvice but I think after some thinking and speaking with close friends I’ve realized this is much more of an anxiety problem than a relationship one. 

I’ve been seeing this woman for about 4 months. It’s definitely a situationship. I want things to move forward but she is cautious. LOGICALLY I understand her motivations. However EMOTIONALLY I am running through a million possibilities in my mind. I have been historically jealous and possessive in previous relationships. I think sometimes this drove past partners away. I have also been cheated on and my most recent partner was physically and emotionally abusive. 

The long and the short of it is this. I cannot stop thinking about her going behind my back and sleeping with someone else. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve been waking up from nightmares and having a hard time eating.

I started spiraling, going to everyone I know for advice and getting a million different answers. It led me to nearly texting her to cut things off today. Thankfully I did some reflecting and I realized regardless of what I do, she has become a fixation. Even if I cut things off I would still be anxious imagining her sleeping with someone else. This is a me problem that I need to address. So that being said, does anyone have any tips for combatting anxious attachment? ",anxiety

*Possible TW*: if you are trying to avoid election related posts, please skip this!💓

AND: I have seen some rude comments under other people’s posts. please refrain from insensitive or invalidating comments. do the right thing and be kind to others :) thanks!

Hi! I posted this under the election megathread, but I wanted to see if I could get any responses with a new post! 
Please help if you can, I haven’t been able to sleep since yesterday :/ (not for a lack of trying). To preface also, I am 22F and am diagnosed with CPTSD, panic disorder, GAD, depression, OCD, and ADHD. Sorry for the long post!

I feel like I have a pit/hole of emptiness in my chest. Once I realized what the results were going to be, every inch of me felt so crushed. Someone said they were in constant fight or flight mode, which I was in a few hours ago too. My mind and heart were, and are, like a ping pong machine. The emptiness/anxiety I feel inside of my chest is what I am left with now that the fight or flight has worn off (somewhat). As a woman in her 20s, my heart feels shattered. Tonights results led to one of the worst flare ups of my CPTSD that I’ve ever experienced. It took me back to when I woke up to my dad telling me who had won in 2016. I was just a young teenage girl at the time, and I could tell my dad was heart broken telling me that he had won the election. Looking back on this day, I see myself as just a little girl that I want to protect so badly. And I see my dad who I want to protect so badly, so he didn’t have to tell his daughter such news. While I didn’t particularly favor the candidate in 2016, the little girl in me was ecstatic at the thought of having the first female president. The same young girl that was crushed that day, feels even more shattered from the results today. I really thought we could do it. Tonight, that same young girl is screaming within my adult body, petrified of what is to come.

I completely broke down in tears and had a panic attack tonight in front of my parents. I never thought my dad would have to help me process the same 2016 election result but in 2024. It breaks my heart that he has to look at me crying out of fear, the fear of being a woman in this country. I have such a love for this world, but now I don’t want to have to sleep because then I’ll have to wake up and face tomorrow. I have always had trouble falling asleep since childhood. I just don’t know how to destress, I just want to feel okay and neutral tonight.

I don’t know what to do, I wish I could shut my brain off and disassociate. I either go in between crying due to getting overwhelmed thinking about how scared and lonely I feel; or I doom scroll election results and tiktok hoping to feel some sense of comfort. I deleted google and anything else related to election results as I just can’t handle it. All of my diagnoses tend to feed off each other, as you can see lol. I have laid down in bed for a few hours now trying to sleep, and I just can’t. 

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions to help? I don’t know much about my CPTSD as im new to learning about my diagnosis and coping mechanisms. Im also starting with a new therapist this week (thank goodness). Has anything helped anyone calm down or get rid of the hopelessness/dread feeling? I know I need to sleep and I have tried, but I just cry.

I hope you are all holding up okay despite what has happened tonight. I am sending all my love. And to all the women, BIPOC, and LGBTQIA+ communities, I send my whole soul with love as I know how scary and lonely it might feel tonight.",anxiety

"How to help/handle a partner that can't deal with the anxiety. I've dealt with generalized anxiety my entire life but about two months ago, everything got so much worse. 

I didn't even really know what was happening at first. I was having rolling panic attack after panic attack. Got to the point where I thought I had the flu for a week because I was so nauseous and weak all the time. I've come to realize that this is my anxiety and for many members of my family it just gets this bad when they hit their thirties. 

Dealing with my anxiety has been hard enough, but honestly my boyfriends reaction to it has made it so much harder and I dont know how to help him or if at this point I give a fuck to. 

The other day he informed that it has become hard to love me. That he doesn't think I'm doing enough to fix it. That I am being selfish. That he can't engage or talk to me unless I'm in a ""good moment."" 

Part of me wants to tell him to fuck off. I'm doing my best. I'm going to doctors, I'm going to therapy, I'm playing the medication game of trial and error. All while not being able to stop my self from going into shaking fits, and dizzy spells. 

Then there's the part of me that's sympathetic that understands that while yes it is hard for me to deal with this that it is strain on him as well. We've been together for 2 years and he didn't sign up to be with someone who at this point is a mostly house bound mess.  

I honestly just don't know how to help him navigate this as I am trying to figure it out myself. Do I just keep everything from him? Do I just accept that he's not the supportive type? 
Do I suggest support groups for people with loved ones with anxiety? Do I send articles about how one can help a loved one with anxiety?

"How do I cope with my anxiety until my psychiatrist appointment? Hey all,

Back in June I've set up an appointment with a psychiatrist which will take place in March 2025.

I thought I could just hold it out until then, I mean it's been in March this year that I first started realizing something might be wrong and I could trace these symptoms back multiple years, so what's a few more months? Right?

The last five weeks have been absolute hell for me. I have to spend so much time in public and it's causing me a crazy amount of anxiety and stress. During lectures I constantly try to keep my composure and at times to get my heart rate down, because it just decides to spike sometimes. Wednesdays are especially bad, since my schedule is really long, which left me just relieved today when the last lecture ended, like I just got away from a life or death situation.

I'd like to think that ever since finding out I could be mentally ill I've done a good job of slowly working through my mental problems in my head, expressing said problems through art and keeping an optimistic outlook on things, however as of late I can feel the tides start to turn.

I am slowly starting to feel myself become numb, more cold and withdrawn. I know that this isn't a healthy coping mechanism, but it's difficult to just go on allowing myself to feel every emotion. The last few months I tried to become more social and even managed to make a friend, yet right now I feel like I should distance myself from them and fade into obscurity, ruining all of my progress. Today I delibrately didn't approach them because I felt too 'unstable' to do so.

This makes me appear unnatural or awkward, almost robotic at times. Despite this, I believe I can improve if I confront these fears because this career has been my dream since childhood.

I worry about not being able to succeed, but is it too early to consider giving up? What should I do?

"Am I just a nightmare to be around ? I always seem to ask for support in a wrong way… 
I mean, since I have anxiety and panic attack (which started over a month ago) I feel very horrible everyday and I’m going worse and worse since I’m having panic attack outside of my apartment…
I reached out to my best friend because I felt so so bad and had a huge panic attack but since I asked her to left class with me she yelled at me that she didn’t want to miss class and that I was bringing her down and she left me alone with it…
Now I feel horrible about that and we didn’t talk since and I didn’t go to school the next day and the day after, but tomorrow I have to go and I feel so so bad and horrified about the idea of seeing her again I keep having panic attacks.
I feel alone, left out and I feel like I do everything wrong and that anxiety’s ruining my life and my relationships…",anxiety
"Sick of these weird physical sensations My anxiety causes a slew of very odd physical sensations. I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced/experiences these sensations and what you did or what you do when you get them.

My skin feels like clay, like malleable clay, but not to the touch. When I move my muscles in my face the skin on it feels like it’s not moving for a few seconds and then I feel the sensation of it moving for like a few seconds after. I’d say crawling sensation but not quite. It’s almost like the delay in touch and motor function sensation you get from an anxiety attack caused by greening out, which I’ve had before and have trauma from, but I don’t understand why this sensation tends to happen even when I don’t smell weed or carts, since I do sometimes have that olfactory based trauma response.

This sensation is also accompanied by paresthesia in the mouth and usually follows getting agitated/irritated or anxious about something, or can randomly crop up because my subconscious anxiety just got triggered for no apparent reason. (Why I take .25 Xanax everyday on top of my 150 Wellbutrin I take at night, just so I can focus on my day and not worry about having to curb a panic attack on my own.)

I write this post because I had just recently had another bout of this… clay sensation and it drove me nuts, but not in a panicky way like it used to the last.. I wanna say five or six times I’ve had it come up. This time was different. It made me mad, I was frustrated at my subconscious and my body for bringing up this feeling again and convincing me it was real. Because it now’s know disgusting I think it is and how uncomfortable it makes me feel in my own body.

With that being said, can anyone tell me if you’ve had this sensation before, what this is from, what you call it, and what you do to get rid of it or prevent it even without medication?",anxiety
"Feel panic/more anxiety when meditating. Any advice? I just did a guided meditation and as soon as I start with the deep inhales and slow exhales I start to feel like I don't know how to breathe and more anxious which in turn breaks my focus and I cannot relax without breaking my meditation. It's even worse when I have tried meditating to settle down my anxiety. This time I was not feeling anxious at all prior to starting so I was hoping it would be different this time around.

"Can anxiety mess with your vision this much At the beginning of September I got covid and my health anxiety skyrocketed. I was having panic attacks daily struggling to get through work and I finally went to the doctor at the beginning of October to talk about anxiety medicine. I've been on a few before with different levels of success and this time we tried buspirone. After 4-5 days of taking it I was finally feeling like I was myself again, I went almost the whole weekend without any anxiety but that Sunday I was sitting around and a big wave of anxiety hit me and I started seeing a flashing in the center of my vision almost like a LED was sitting turning on and off non-stop. I went in the next day to the optometrist which said my eyes were perfectly healthy.  Over the next couple days the flashing calmed down a bit not being there 100% of the time but other things started including: 
-positive after images 
-visual trails behind anything moving
-small flashes in my vision as well as pinhole sized black spots that come and go but never last long
-bfep and floaters way more than normal
-eye pain like they were really dry. I would use eye drops and they would help a bit but not for long
 -I also noticed when I would close my eyes I would see these hazy blobs moving almost like a lava lamp. Not super bright but noticable even though I was in complete darkness
-having hypnogogic hallucinations that I've never had before. Like I would be almost asleep and start seeing things like i was watching a movie. I could almost control them. 

Since then a lot of it has seemed to calm down. The flashing in the center of my vision has turned more into a kind of static instead of a very sharp circle and it's not as bright and I only really notice it when I have my eyes closed or an looking at a blank wall or something. The floaters and bfep aren't as bothering and the white flashes and black pinholes have gone for the most part. My eye pain is mostly gone since I got new glasses and I don't think I'm straining my eyes as much. The sleep stuff is better but still there. But the positive afterimages and trails haven't seemed to get any better. I think I'm getting used to them more than anything but it's made things like watching tv hard because it seems like it's super low frame rate or something. 

The doctor said it could be the buspirone so when I stopped that he said it could be a couple weeks before it went away. After going back last week and telling him I'm still having problems we are getting an MRI scheduled to make sure nothing is wrong in the brain. He also switched me to Lexapro which has helped calm my anxiety and keep me able to function.

"Physical symptoms check.  Hello. 

Im a female, 24. I had my first panic/anxiety attack last week. It was very intense and traumatic. I’ve been having post-attack symptoms that appear out of nowhere. 

Most of them go directly to my digestive system, such as stomach pain, colitis, I feel like I’m gonna 💩 myself every time it happens. 

Also, I get a pressure feeling near to my diaphragm, that usually comes with difficulty to breathe.

The last one is jaw tension, as if i was very very cold.

Does anybody else experience the same sensations as me? How do you overcome these symptoms?

"Facial wasting from anxiety -- did it regain? Been suffering major stress and anxiety for 1,5 months and during this time my face has wasted away. Weight wise I've only lost like 1,5 kg but my cheeks are sunken and fallen.

I'm currently on sick leave and trying to focus on rest, sleep and relaxing. It's hard though because BDD about my face is one of the big causes of anxiety for me. So I'm having trouble trusting that it'll just get better with time. I absolutely hate what I look like at the moment.

I didn't even have trouble eating during the high-anxiety period, but I slept poorly and exercised less which both lead to not eating as healthily. I think biggest reason for my face wasting away has been the poor sleep.",anxiety

"My anxiety is gonna make me lose a friendship Hi, I really need your help in this, like probably today is the last day of this friendship if I don't do something

I have a friend that I met 7 months ago, but still is that kind of friendship that feels like you've known the other person for a long time even if you haven't

The problem comes 2 weeks ago, she was always the one who started conversations, and then, suddenly stopped. I know why, she wanted to prove if I was gonna talk to her, and I really wanted to, but my anxiety didn't let me, and while time passed, my thoughts grew, things like ""How do I start this conversation?"" ""How am I gonna just go talk to her when we haven't talked in 2 weeks?"" ""Even if I start the conversation, what will we talk about? It's been two weeks"" ""What if nothing's like it was?""

And it's been two weeks, I've said sorry 2 times now (explaining her my social anxiety but still promising to try and start the conversation, also this means she even gave me a third opportunity). Yesterday I tried starting a conversation with her via chat 'cause I'm still way too nervous to start a conversation in person, and it went shitty, she was awkward, and I didn't know what to say

And today, at lunch time, one of my friends basically forced me to sit with her (thank God my friend also sat with me), but I just couldn't, my anxiety overcame me, I was too nervous, I didn't know how to start the conversation, and she just changed to another table with her friends

And then, I overhear a conversation of her and her friends talking abt me, and she's like ""I'm thinking if giving her a third opportunity was the right thing, if this doesn't improve, maybe it's time to say goodbye"" and her friends agreed, so if I don't do something soon, she will leave, and I don't want her to

So I need ideas, ideas to overcame my thoughts (the main one is thinking that it will be weird or uncomfortable, or that maybe she won't wanna talk to me, and also being super nervous when talking to her on person) and also ideas to start the conversation again after all of this, after we haven't talked in two weeks and after the mistake of today, because I just don't know how to start so the conversation will follow",anxiety
"Anyone else? Recently had a major increase in my anxiety to which i can only refer to as a severe panic attack, literally thought I was losing my mind> WHAT IS THAT?! Ive had a LOT of things happen in the last year, a lot. Is that something that can bring on this kind of reaction? I was nauseous, unable to be around anyone, wanted to crawl out of my skin etc. I was sitting on the bathroom floor in a state of fight or flight. Ended up in the ER, twice. Second time was after 3 days on Prozac 20mgs, literally sent me spiraling, crying and wondering what is happening to me. Ended up going to the ER the second time for a psych evaluation because I was desperate. They gave me ativan IV, and also a dose of hydroxyzine 25 mgs. My psychiatrist that i JUST started seeing last Wednesday (not the one at the ER) now has me on Lamotrigine 25mgs once a day to start because after my reaction to Prozac we are under the assumption I am extremely sensitive to SSRIs. The weird thing is when people (a few family members who know what's happened) ask me how I'm doing it throws me into anxiety again, why is that? Anyone else feel that way.

"Therapist Distracted During Session. What Do I Do? At the beginning of our session today, I heard the sound of my therapists text notification go off multiple times. This is not uncommon, and he will typically say “Whoops. Let me put that on Do Not Disturb” or something. I think the phone is connected to his laptop in some way. I was in the middle of answering a question he asked me and it is SO HARD to be vulnerable. I heard the sound of an iPhone message being sent. There were several incoming and outgoing text messages over the next few minutes, and his eyes frequently shifted back and forth between me and his screen and he was typing. I eventually had his undivided attention for the rest of the session, but I completely shut down. 

I feel so unimportant. So embarrassed for being vulnerable today, and all the times in prior sessions. I feel so stupid for any thought I’ve ever had that lead me to believe we are a team and is attuned. 

I’m a big fawner. I’d have a hard time addressing this. Part of me wants to just move on like nothing ever happened, and just ghost if it ever happens again. Another part of me wants to confront him maybe in an email and say “this is what you did and this is how I feel” but I’m a big fawner and don’t think I would.

"Well.. is it hyper awareness?  I’ve been dealing with panic disorder being back for about a month and a week. Constant anxiety. Dizziness etc., but I’ve noticed over the last few days my dizziness gets worse after eating. Takes 15 or so minutes to start, and then lasts anywhere from 1-2 hours. And of course it causes anxiety, and sometimes panic. I did one search, and it said if you get dizzy after a meal, to seek emergency medical care.

I do have pre hypertension. But I’m not sure that’s what’s causing it. My anxiety is so bad I’ve needed blood work for 3 weeks. And haven’t been able to get it. Everytime I go I have a panic attack and they won’t take my blood due to an increased risk of fainting. White coat syndrome 101. ",anxiety

"i took magnesium and it gave me anxiety  i appreciate all of the advice that people give on here, but this is a reminder to take things with a grain of salt and that everyone is different. i did some reading on taking the supplement after seeing so many people saying that they took magnesium and it ""saved their life"" and ""im a completely different person""

bought some magnesium bisglycinate because i've been exercising more frequently and thought it'd be a better option for me. took it at around 7pm with dinner, and 2 hours later it felt like my anxiety was ramping up, but it passed within 1 minute, so i brushed it off because i thought it was because ive been more tired than usual. i got ready for bed and tried to go to sleep, but jesus christ did it do a number on me lol

i lay there for an hour trying to sleep but i had the worst clamminess and hotness ive had in years. i couldn't get comfortable... i fell asleep for an hour and woke up to the same thing. i was about ready to call 911 for the first time in my life. i didn't feel like it was a full blown panic attack, my heart wasn't racing, and my mind wasn't racing with terrible thoughts, i was just cold/sweating/scared. i'm in canada, so i messaged 811 instead, who told me to visit a doctor within 24 hours, drink lots of clear fluids and juice, and lay with my legs elevated for an hour. i didn't get any good sleep at all lol i think i was waking up every hour because of how uncomfortable i felt.

i felt a little h better waking up the next day, but i was anxious about what happened the night before, i hesitantly booked an appointment at a walk-in clinic where i got to talk to a doctor and get my blood drawn. the doctor themselves said ""that's weird, magnesium usually does the opposite"". i came home and did some more reading, and found that if magnesium imbalances calcium levels, it can cause anxiety! anyways, i came home and repeated the same routine i did the night before minus the magnesium, and knocked out for 8 hours straight. maybe it was me being exhausted, maybe not 

my anxiety levels to begin with were manageable, and i do take other supplements with no problem. this was just a good reminder not to jump the gun at a hopeful ""this saved my life"" story. everyone's different, and i know a good number of people on here are apprehensive about going to the doctor to check their deficiencies before taking something you can buy from anywhere, but please do!

"Spiraling is horrible today. Sorry for grammar I don't type right when I'm anxious like this Yesterday, I had a massive appointment with my gynecologist to figure out some strange symptoms in my body (ended up diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis) and I was given a bunch of meds. I am extremely anxious with meds as someone who also has POTS & Dysautonomia.

Once, I was put on Lamictal & Risperidone, which made my heart so out of rhythm and whatnot that I was hospitalized. Found out that women my age, with the conditions I have, should not be given those meds because people have died taking them or ended up seriously hurt. It took WEEKS for my body to feel slightly normal again, and I still have problems with my heart to this day from it. Recently, I was given Macrobid and I also had a very terrifying reaction to it.

Because of these experiences, I am deathly terrified of any med I'm given, even antibiotics or simple medicines, like cough medicines, laxatives, Benadryl, or even antacids. The only med I can take without having a panic attack is my Atenolol, because it regulates my heartbeat and helps me sleep. I also don't drink anything but water and only eat plain white rice these days because most foods will trigger my body to feel like I'm dying. My body flushes, my heartrate goes up, and my anxiety spikes. My guts will hurt, my bladder will hurt, and everything just feels awful.

On top of this, I'm anxious about the election results, and deathly afraid as the senator in my state who was elected wants to get rid of Medicare and Social Security, things I rely on to get medical help, feed me and my 2 cats, etc. I feel like my safety net is completely gone even with the money I do have saved up, and I feel like I am not going to survive the next 4 years. I am guaranteed going to die if these people's laws become reality. I worry about my mom, too. She has Parkinson's and is also on Medicare, and without her meds she wouldn't be able to survive longer than 3 days. I keep trying to tell myself that everything will be okay, and that I'm overthinking, but I can't help to think that my fear is very real and not just because I'm going crazy.

My family, mostly very conservative, were having a group-text party thing celebrating the election today, and I just couldn't take it anymore. I had a split (I have BPD) and I went off on every one of them, saying that if I die from the laws made by the people they elected, that their blood is in my hands and my death will be their fault. I was of course, met with resistance and the whole ""God will heal you, just pray to him"" speech I usually get. My sister tried to reason with me, but I was too far gone in my BPD spiral to accept anything she was saying, and she angrily left the group chat telling me to get out of my irrational thinking.

So now I'm ashamed at the bridges I've burnt, and feel like a failure as once again, I've had a split. I will always feel like until the day I never have an outburst or split again, that I will be unlovable, unworthy, and a horrible, toxic person. My anxiety is filled with the words I've seen people write about people with BPD. How they're less than human, not normal, and that even if they're in therapy, they'll never truly be changed and will always at some point become an issue again, never deserving of love or even a chance at redemption. This is how I feel about myself.

I've had people tell me ""you've changed a lot since you left your ex, you're handling things better"", but all I hear in my mind is the people who say that BPD people will never be good enough because they're always going to be a problem. I can never accept the good things about me that people tell me. And each time I slip up and let my emotions out, I am convinced once again that they are absolutely correct and that there is no hope for me, as I know it's impossible for me to live the rest of my life without having an emotional outburst. I drive people away because of my paranoia during an outburst. My anxiety goes into overdrive, and I question every little word someone says to me in an attempt to comfort me. I can't help it, it's almost like it's hardwired in me to do so because I just know deep down, what I've been conditioned to believe by what I've seen is true, as I'm doing the exact things that I'm told are not acceptable, like cry, scream, throw things or break things, etc etc.

3 years of therapy, and actively practicing the skills I've been taught, writing things down and studying new strategies to help me better, and I've only maybe gotten better in my opinion about 20%. My parents will say I'm much better than before, but I know they're biased because they're my parents. The rest of my family doesn't know the full extent of my outbursts, and even with how awful I was today, they haven't even fully seen me at my worst so I can't speak for them. I'm scared of making my therapist exhausted with me because I keep coming to her with the same issues and she has to repeat ""Well let's go back to this strategy again"". If I was truly getting better, I'd have mastered that strategy by now, wouldn't I have? I wouldn't be tiring out professionals by coming back to them with the same complaints if I actually was getting better.

Hence why I think I'm not better. That I'm just lying to myself and that because of how damaged I am, I won't ever reach perfection. I know I'm not making excuses to not take what my therapist has said to heart and practice the skills I've learned in therapy, because I really do. I have hundreds of pages written down of things I've actively practiced, and I have seen results, even some outbursts were avoided entirely from the skills I've utilized. But I feel like until the day I never have an outburst again, or a BPD spiral, or any slip ups, that I'll never be able to say ""I'm better"" or ""I'm healed"", and that I can't accept the title or compliments from others saying I am better at managing my emotions. Because deep down I feel like I'm not. Is that a weird form of imposter syndrome? I don't know anymore.

I want to live because I don't want to abandon the ability to experience good things, like my cats, nature, music, etc etc by being dead, but sometimes I wonder if it would be better if I was dead because I wouldn't have anything to worry about. Then when I'm on that line of thought, I get scared because of the whole ""Be careful what you wish for"" thing and I try to think ""No I want to live, please don't let me die I take it back"" and I cry thinking I'm gonna die.

Being around him I can tell immediately when he is off.  He has about 2 weeks left until his next refill.  My question is can I perhaps return the current pills to the pharmacy and maybe they can switch them.  Because in a few more days here we are gonna have to baker act him again.  He usually stays up nonstop and starts saying really crazy shit.  It is not fun to deal with this.  Can his therapist make a script for teva brand only?  Can we go to different pharmacies until we get teva brand.  I mean other brands have worked but these Aurobindo are the worst so far.,anxiety

"Sleep anxiety, need advice need advice

Hello guys, i need some medication advice from you:)

First, im sorry for my english, im germanspeaking.

My situation: im studying and i have the problem, that before every exam-day, i cant sleep because of anxiety. in this moment i tell myself, that i need to be wellrested to sucseed in my exam. im working on that problem with my therapist, so pleace dont tell me now to just do some breathing exercieces etc.

i found a year ago a perfect solution: ambien. it worked like a charm, took all my anxiety away, and i could finally sleep well before my exams. the only problem is, that i do fu***** weird stuff on ambien. i sleepwalk and calling random people via phone while on it, so i cant take that anymore...:(

My solution: finding a ""good"" benzo. 
My question: which benzo can you recommend for sleeping? for me its important, that the medicine is able to ""knock me out"" besides my anxiety, but doesnt mess whith my sleep all to bad (i want to be well rested the next day for my exam). Please note: i only take this kind of pills one night in three moths, not one pill more, so please dont tell me the ""dont take benzos, theyre super dangerous and addictive etc"". -( i know that very well)) story, im just asking for some experiences! :)

my choice know would be diazepam or temazepam, both because of the longer half life (dont want to wake up in the middle of the night), and because i already know people who use these two for sleeping.

"Severe anxiety & depression over toxic workplace & boss Hi Guys, I had joined my current company in Feb of this year, and since past 2.5 months, my boss has been severely toxic to me(pointing out my non existent mistakes & making me feel bad publicly and speaking rudely) and also made the management share me a warning letter for my work performance (my performance has been nothing but exemplary out of all of my coworkers), she is pin pointing me in every task of mine which is making me to be on the edge & anxious all the time. Recently, few new coworkers have been added to our team as I think they are a substitute as I feel my boss is trying to make the management fire me & trying to stage all of the shortcomings of the team on me which is ridiculous because I've been performing consistently good. Also, every week , a new person will be joining team & I've been given the task to orient them. 

I'm trying my best to cover everything in orientation but even after office hours or during office , I'm having really bad anxiety that my boss will put the blame on me entirely if the new joiners will fail to perform.

My personal life has been hell since 3 months. It's either crying, or having ruminating thoughts or just having crippling anxiety in weekdays, weekends or after office. 

Even though I'm trying to better myself by being emotionally strong by practicing gratitude & mindfulness, I'm just constantly scared of what my boss will do or say if any of the new joiners will do something bad. At this stage, she's just trying to find & create new reasons to blame me.

"Conflict anxiety I have recently become aware of my pretty severe confrontational anxiety. I always knew I didn't like conflict but recent events have made me realize that it's way deeper than that. 

I have been doing really well recently and all my other symptoms of depression and anxiety have decreased while my social anxiety has increased. Conflict is a HUGE trigger. I feel like I am back to square one. 

So my question is, how do you deal? Obviously conflict is important! It's an essential skill to healthy relationships and I get that. I am lucky to have a spouse who is considerate and kind so when we do disagree it is with extra awareness and sensitivty. I just can't expect everyone to be like that though (I used to and I would get so offended when they weren't as sensitive as me)

It is my personality that I am an impulsive talker. I just say what comes to my mind and don't always think it through. Being a stay at home mom for the last 6 years hasn't helped my social skills (but I love it!)

As a kid, I had learned it was better to keep my mouth shut in my own feelings (so much so that I convinced myself I was indifferent). I don't think I was ever real with people except for my husband/boyfriend at the time because he is such a nurturer.
I am an extreme people-pleaser and it is so exhausting that I don't like people anymore even though I have always thought of myself as an extrovert. 

I think the realization has been a little disheartening. I know this is going to take a lot of time to work through and it's hard to know what I'm ready for and what I'm not. I still have a family to care for and lots of responsibilities and dreams I can't just put on hold while I figure this out. 

I think sometimes exposure can work against me when things end up rotten and messy because I said something stupid that I didn't really mean or I didn't stop and think so I wasn't fully understanding. It's easy to feel confident when I am flawless but that is rarely really never the case.

"Can't decide what's enough. Hi fooks
Pun intended Folks

I m a CSE pre final uni student. I can't think of what's enough. As in I always crave more of everything.

I want to own more of information. I m minimalist though. I really do live like a popper. At age 20, I have exam and social anxiety. Also I do not want to spend any money on me and am stingy. I am afraid of people.

Let me tell you one by one the reasons.

While I was a kid. I was joyful little extrovert kid with lot's of curiosity. But as years passed just as I entered grade 5 my father was really harsh on me. I could not go out to play. While as kid I would be out of home even during noon playing.

I am aboriginal tribal racially. In india we are outcast. People hate us. We are discriminated. In grade 8, my studyios friends stopped talking to me once they talked about my caste. This continues even now while I am at uni.

I want to have more information as due to lack of right information I missed getting into a prestigious uni just some 30kms from my house. Ended up trying one year more for entrance exam and miserabley got ruined. I started to have a depressive period. I did not know what the depression is 🤣. I thought I m going through philosophical maturity and awakening 🤣.

My father also always compared to his colleagues and friends kids. He ridiculed me for being a bad son and I was burden and he is wasting money on me. Daily on dinner.

I also wasted the money over my coaching but couldn't clear the exam with flying marks. Now I am full of guilt and stingy.

Now I am into web dev and I got a few 5k offer for the internship. But I thought I should start at least 10k per month. But now I am in confusion.

I am afraid of people and making friends because of the bad treatment I had from my own father. Also the fact, people hate me merely for me being aboriginal. So I feel like people are against me.

"I study excessively as away to have control TL;DR: I think studying has become a compulsive behavior for me whenever I feel like I have no control over something. Just want to know other anxious people's experiences with this.

I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) since forever, and it affects my studies and general productivity very strongly. Studying is like my way of seeking control over my life. I'm currently in undergrad. When I feel sad, worried, overwhelmed, angry, for any reason outside of college, I sit down and study. Very often, I recognize studying so much is the exact reason why I feel tired and burned out, but I still do it. It's like a reflex. I take notes, read the book, solve and re-solve problems, work on assignments 10 days early, anything. I bury myself in it as deep as possible in order to forget the world, and cling to it as something I can control.

My grades are quite high because of this, but to me, they can never be high enough. I'm hypercritical of myself, and every little misstep feels huge. I'm at a constant state of worry and alertness, always asking myself what I have to do next.

I do have hobbies outside of it. I dance, draw, fold origamis, learn yarn work, etc. But even then, some of this drive to learn quickly and be better always spills over, even for the most innocent of activities like making amigurumi figures. I find myself practicing my dance routines tirelessly and never being satisfied with myself, for example. Or comparing my drawings and paintings to other people's and feeling sad. And, when I feel sad, I once again turn to burying myself in my studies.

I think my attitude towards it genuinely qualifies as a compulsion. I've been in therapy for a while, but never really used this term to refer to it until now. 

It's odd, because, to many people, being a workaholic is a good thing. I'm not harming myself, I'm just ""being productive"". It's good to always be working, to be so driven and focused; there are even a lot of tutorials of ""how to trick your brain and become addicted to studying!"". But it really is not cool. It's very tiring and I can never be happy with myself, because I'm constantly chasing my next goal and forfeiting things that would bring me joy in the name of it.

This is just me airing out my thoughts. I think this might be way too common and normalized, since the world is constantly asking more of us. Me being in academia definitely does not help, since the culture is so toxic. Share your experiences if you can relate to it, I'd like to hear from other people who might be struggling to get their minds out of ""productive mode"".",anxiety

"Scared of lymphoma and other cancers. Bloodwork is fine buy xray says "" increased airspace density over the right midlung"". Help 

Age 26

Sex female 

I have a fear of having a lymphoma or other cancers. Last couple of months I've been having night sweats. Not drenching but I feel my legs and lower back damp under the comforter. That's been happening last couple of months. Not every night but most nights. I also started to feel lower back pain especially when I bend over, it's not bad but I feel it. Last week I got some itchy throat followed by fever and chills which went down after taking ibuprofen. After this I got wheezing in my right lung and wheezing in throat. I went to the dr yesterday and she did my labs. Bloodwork came back in normal range. She ordered xray because she heard something on my lung and xray says: 

There is a subtle small area of increased airspace density over the right midlung with differential diagnosis of infection/inflammation. Recommend short-term radiograph follow-up.
 
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
No acute osseous abnormality within the visible skeleton.

She prescribed me prednisone and antibiotic for that. I didn't feel any wheezing today after I took prednisone yesterday. I still feel some weird tightness in my chest. I've been coughing more with mucus today too. My problem is that no one around me was sick. Not my son, not my husband. Well my husband got some infection like 3 weeks ago but that's a long time ago. I'm scared there is something developing in my lungs. I'm petrified and I can't even eat.

I haven't seen my xray but I was googling some lymphoma xray images and I'm scared there is something growing in my lung.

I quit vaping yesterday. It's been a full 24 hours. My resting hr has gone from 80-100 to 55-65. It doesn't increase nearly as fast. I feel better than I've felt in years. I've always known the harmful causes of nicotine. I didn't realize how big of a difference it would make me feel. All within 24 hours. Maybe it's a placebo, maybe I became extremely sensitive to nicotine. Who knows. 

I'll never touch one again. The withdrawals are nothing compared to the peace I feel having my hr this low. I can't remember the last time I felt safe in my own body and not afraid of my heart. Please, if you vape, try quitting. I know it's difficult, but, it's so worth the time.

"My mind keeps creating new anxiety triggers For the past few months I used to visit a discussion in a fandom forum that was triggering to me. I couldn't help visiting it, it was like a very intense compulsion. But it was giving me panic/anxiety attacks.

Finally, after around 2-3 months I can say that place doesn't trigger me anymore, nor do I get the compulsion to visit it or feel like something bad is going to happen if I don't.

But now my mind keeps giving me multiple other reasons to feel anxious about. Stupid stuff like worrying a person judges me if they happen to look at me slightly off. Which I actually wouldn't even care if that was true. Or walking down the street and comparing myself to everyone else, feeling like I'm a black sheep and a weirdo, or me having something really off about me. I did go to therapy and said everything, but this therapist wasn't good, she didn't help with my anxiety at all. I felt like I was wasting my money (which I barely have) to not make any progress at all for two months.

"Empathy, people pleasing & boundaries Hello y‘all. 

So I just want to share my story and how I am slowly recovering from having social anxiety, erytrophobia and a crippling insomnia. Leading me to a point where I couldn‘t go on anymore. I needed change but I couldn‘t change until I realized something about myself. 

The thing is this: I am way too empathetic. I can relate to people extremely well, positive and negative. Empathy is something great, but for me it was a trained survival strategy. Let me explain:

I grew up in an unstable household, to say the least: My father was an alcoholic and always went violent when he drank. He never hit me (luckily) but my mother once and almost broke my brothers arm. My parents would fight a lot. Shouting, screaming, slamming doors. My mom cried a lot and really loud. My dad would spend his evenings in our basement, drinking one bottle after another. One day I went to the basement and I saw some torn rope hanging from a pipe on the ceiling. It was way too thin but 9 year old me could only imagine he tried to hang himself. But I cant be certain today. My father moved out at some point. Fast forward a couple of months and actually I felt like my parents relationship getting better. My father visited more often and the mood was okay. Then one fateful day, when I thought everything would be okay again, my father died. 

I didnt go to school for sometime afterwards. But when I eventually went back, I was really happy to see my friends and classmates again. To just have some normal time for once. But of course the school knew and of course the teachers talked to the other kids about why I wasnt there for some weeks. So everybody knew. There was no more normality for me. I didn‘t feel safe at home and I felt like the odd one out at school. But I just wanted to fit in and feel safe. So to navigate this mess I learned the amazing skill of empathy. I learned how others felt in certain situations so I could adjust myself to that. I acted in ways to not offend anybody, to not risk exclusion or that someone might be upset with me and I would feel in danger again like when I did with my alcoholic father.

Reading others and adjusting my behavior to that became my survival strategy. And it worked. I always got along with everyone but only because I became a people pleaser. This behavior deepened and I developed social anxiety. I even was anxious around people I loved. I could not upset them, or else they might leave me. So I thought. But in this process I lost myself. I always felt like a social chameleon. Always adjusting to others and their needs, never being myself. 

I struggled for almost 20 years. Only currently I discovered that I am „using“ my empathy wrong. I stopped second guessing my actions and thinking about how others reacted or might react to future actions. I started to set boundaries, especially for myself. I always felt connected to others, but it got too much. I need more separation. 

Empathy is amazing, don‘t get me wrong. Its enabling us to build deep and lasting relationships and to help people in need. But taken too far it just backfires. Too much of a good thing is still too much. Especially if you lack the ability to set healthy boundaries. I needed to learn to look out for myself. Since realizing this I feel way calmer, especially in social settings, my insomnia is slowly improving and even my digestion. I overall feel like myself again. It wasn‘t just an epiphany and I was cured. It took me a long time to get me where I am. But I learned that I get to decide how I behave, what I say and what I do. I don‘t need everybodies approval and I don‘t need everybody to like me. 

Thank you for reading.

"Why am I like this I feel really bad right now and I’m not very good at certain sensations (like icky throat, clogged nose, sour taste, etc.) and it causes me to gag and I throw up.

Yes. Gum. Not actually gum but I had red chewing gum and my whole spit was pink. It was gross and made me sad that I can’t keep anything down. I don’t want to be like this. I see other people managing just fine with colds, my parents are fine, my siblings are fine and I am 20 YEARS OLD AND I AM NOT FINE.

I am anxiety ridden, I can’t handle certain sensations around the body and it causes me to gag, I barely sleep at night when I’m anxious, and many more.

"Does anyone else feel like they can’t take a satisfying breath in? Is this anxiety For about 10 years I’ve had this problem with breathing, where every few minutes or so I feel like I can’t get a satisfying breath in.

I’ve done tests to prove it’s not asthma, and so anxiety seems like the likely cause, I’m just wondering if anyone else has this when they don’t feel anxious, and what medications or therapies have helped. It’s ruining my life a bit because I’ll be in meetings at work and having to yawn so many times which seems so unprofessional. ",anxiety

"Question: full breath only when on Xanax Background: I’m 30m. I grew up in the culty-er side of Christianity. One of the many things I internalized was that anxiety and worry were sinful - so I have only recently (past 2-3 years) been able to start noticing, acknowledging, and processing the anxiety that has plagued me my whole life rather than calling it stress. 

I’m learning a lot as I try to be more in touch with my body and aware of how this all is affecting me

I’ve recently noticed that when I take a Xanax, I get to breathe deeply. Not just take deep breaths, but fill my lungs. 

When I am not taking it, I can take a deep breath, do box breathing, etc. But it feels like I can fill 20% more in a breath when I take my meds

I don’t even know if this makes sense, but if it does, I would love to hear folks’ thoughts, feedback, or just similar experiences. Is this just a signal that I am anxious all the time? Are there other physical signals I should be paying attention to?

PS: I wasn't on drug or alchool the road was extremely slippery due to the rain and the oil and mud that the tractor leave on this road. I crashed into the fence of a nearby house. The owner of the house explained to me that car crash here at least twice a year and he always have to fix his fence so that comfort me in the idea that indeed there is probably a problem with this fucking road.

Heart rate Is a resting heart rate of 55 a cause for concern? I’m 21M and just a lil freaked out,anxiety
"Heart palpitations  Ever since high school my brain became hyper stimulated. I think it was due to long nights of studying and eventually I had a panic attack. For the next few months I couldn’t sleep and I had a few more panic attacks like waking up in the middle of the night with anxiety that caused my heart to race really fast and then calm down. I called 911 a couple of times thinking I was going to die. 

Fast forward I was on anti depressants to ease my anxiety and I can say that all my symptoms went away for the entire time I took them but I eventually got off of them because I no longer wanted to be dependent on medication .

Recently I woke up in the middle of the night and thought that something was stuck in my chest (not really pain) and my anxiety took over and I started panicking. Then all was well for the next few weeks but before I have panic attacks there’s always a trigger e.g I stayed up studying the night before . Which is what I did like 2 week backs and due to my brain always being hyper stimulated I can’t sleep for the next few nights (I close my eyes but I’m aware of everything) now I’ve become more aware of my heart palpitations my cardio phobia is at an all time high . I don’t think it’s anything major because I played like 3 hours of basketball and my palpitations literally went away that night and I felt great but my palpitations came back the next few days. 

I’m no doctor but I feel like my lack of quality sleep has contributed to this. My brain doesn’t fall asleep for a while until each panic attack is over idk I’m just really afraid and scared for my life. I’m most likely going to visit a doctor but I feel like bawling my eyes out I hate this shit so much. I have moments where I feel amazing and I also have moments where I feel scared for my life. I really hope there’s nothing wrong with my heart I don’t like being hyper aware of my palpitations at all.",anxiety

"I'm think that there are cameras in my room. Im 14 and I'm convinced my parents have secret cameras in the house and it really makes me uncomfortable, in my own home.

Firstly, A while ago, while trying to connect my Bluetooth headphones to my phone , they kept connecting to something different.I then heard talking through them , and realised it was a conversation I had the day before. I told my mum about it and she listened to it , but seemed weirdly calm about it which is weird because shes always paranoid about that stuff.I started searching for a camera because I remember my dad had a camera which also recorded audio and would set it up whenever we went on holiday, but I didn't find anything. 

Now recently , I glanced at my dad's phone unintentionally while we were sitting in the living room together,  and he had the app that the recordings for the camera were stored in and I swear I saw an image of our living room. Then a couple of days later , We were sitting in the car  outside of my house , waiting for my sister , and he opened the app again and I am convinced that it was a recording of our living room. I understand if the camera was there for security,  but we were litreally outside the house and left 5 minutes ago , and my mum was home. 

I obviously checked the room again, and in the TV box or whatever it's called, when you shine a light on it there's something that looks like a camera and has that type of blue shine on it , like phone camera has. It also had hot glue or something around it so it looks like it's been stuck in. I'm not sure if this is just a Sensor or something for the TV remote ,but it looks like a camera.

I'm sorry If this is stupid and I'm just paranoid, but I'm really anxious about it and worried that there's cameras in my room aswell or something.",anxiety
"Health anxiety 24/7 I've (20F) had horrible health anxiety for a month now and I don't know how to get out of it. I had covid a month ago and a week after the initial infection passed I had a panic attack which made me feel like my thoughts slowed down the next morning which THEN made me google the symptoms and find out about long covid and brain fog that sent me into a health anxiety loop. I don't have brain fog and I know I don't because the symptoms people describe are way more severe and I've come to terms that the ""slowing down"" of thoughts was due to the panic attack, but the anxiety has caused a bunch more physical symptoms that are now constantly making me worry. It made my GERD (which I've had under contol for over 5 years) come back severely which then mimicked the symptoms of a heart attack (that led to another panic attack) that sent me to the ER. Now every single day I have an new anxiety symptom that makes me think I'm dying and makes me obssesively google symptoms and conditions and I am under 24/7 anxiety, I really don't remember the last time I have felt normal. Over the past month I have convinced myself I have leukemia (my wbc on my blood test came higher than it should've been) and a brain tumor. I have had over 5 panic attacks in this past month. My anxiety makes me have some weird memory issues (forgetting words and names of celebs) that don't make my case of overthinking about brain tumors and long covid any better. I really just don't know how to stop thinking about it since the symptoms are always there and are always freaking me out. It has ruined my life and sent me into a depresssive episode and I'm experiencing some depersonalization because of it too. I've went to my family doctor and she's sending me to do some blood tests for vitamin defficiencies and thyroid issues before I go see a therapist, but I really fear for my future because I can't live like this.",anxiety

"Kids should be taught about how anxiety/stress arises in the brain and how to overcome it. I keep reading about record numbers of anxiety/stress in kids and adults but I don't see many solutions that actually get the issue of how it anxiety/stress forms int he first place and how to overcome it. I have no idea why the current understanding of how anxiety/stress arises in the brain is not taught in school to kids so they can learn how to recognise it and be taught the tools to overcome it. Here is what I would do,

# Why Teaching About the Amygdala and Thoughts in Schools Would Be Transformative

1. **Reducing Anxiety and Fear Responses**: If kids understood that fear and anxiety often stem from the amygdala’s response to perceived threats (not actual threats), they’d be more equipped to handle anxiety-provoking situations. They’d know they have the power to retrain their brain through exposure and reframing, rather than avoiding situations and unintentionally reinforcing their fears.
2. **Developing Resilience**: Teaching kids how to confront their fears in a healthy way could help them build resilience. Instead of fearing failure or embarrassment, they could view these as normal parts of growth. They would learn that exposure and a bit of humor about the situation can help them overcome their fears, making life’s challenges more approachable.
3. **Normalizing Random, Unwanted Thoughts**: Explaining that most of our thoughts are just random, fleeting, and don’t define us would free kids from taking every thought seriously. They would realize that intrusive or strange thoughts don’t reflect who they are or what they truly want; they’re simply the brain’s “noise.” This could reduce self-judgment and help them develop a healthier relationship with their inner thoughts.
4. **Empowering Self-Regulation Skills**: By understanding how intentional thought differs from random thought, kids could start to discern what to focus on and what to let go. They’d learn to channel their attention towards intentional thoughts that serve them, while acknowledging and dismissing the random “junk” thoughts.
5. **Improving Mental Health Literacy**: Providing this knowledge would help demystify mental health. Kids would see that anxiety, stress, and intrusive thoughts are part of being human, not signs of weakness. It would also open up space for discussing emotions openly, helping to reduce the stigma around mental health from a young age.

# Practical Ways Schools Could Implement This Learning

1. **Basic Neuroscience in Health Education**: Simple lessons about the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and how thoughts work could give students insight into how their brains process emotions and reactions. Age-appropriate discussions on how thoughts aren’t always meaningful would help normalize experiences like intrusive thoughts.
2. **Mindfulness and Cognitive Skills Classes**: Mindfulness practices, along with teaching kids to identify and challenge negative thoughts, would give them direct experience in regulating emotions and letting go of unhelpful thoughts. They could learn that they don’t have to believe every thought or feel defined by every feeling.
3. **Emotional Resilience Programs**: Programs focused on emotional resilience and self-compassion would teach kids how to approach fears with curiosity and humor, to see challenges as opportunities for growth, and to view ""failure"" as just a step in learning.
4. **Journaling and Reflection**: Journaling could help students reflect on their thoughts and experiences without over-attaching to them. Writing out fears or intrusive thoughts could even allow them to see how absurd some thoughts are, reinforcing that not every thought holds value.
5. **Classroom Discussions on Growth Mindset**: Conversations around growth mindset, fear, and resilience could reinforce the idea that challenges, setbacks, and anxiety are part of growth, not indicators of their self-worth.

This basic level of teaching to kids and adults could help them to become more resilient to anxiety and stress and know how to deal with it if they do experience it. So why on earth is it not implemented in schools?",anxiety
"Depersonalization + Derealization 21 F here… I’ve had a lot of anxiety growing up and still do… I think about a lot of bad things lately, a bunch of intrusive thoughts that just see to affect me everyday. I notice that these intrusive thoughts are all related to death. Fear of death of my loved ones, just the grief feeling when it hasn’t even happened. I had this issue for over a year-ish now. I told my sister about it a year ish ago too and she calmed me down and I’ve tried to tell myself everything is fine and that is the process of life, because it is. Anyways,

I notice most of my depersonalization episodes happen at home. Today I spend majority of my say at school occupied but as soon as I get home, I just feel like I can’t breathe (my nose also has also been inflamed for like a year now and certain environments make it worse) so that doesn’t help, I overthink so much at home and then I start feeling so out of body. Like I’m in a dream and I can just collapse any moment. I tell myself it’s all in my head but it’s hard. Just casually cooking and I just feeel like it’s all an illusion, objects don’t feel real and everything numbs out. How can I help myself 😣 I don’t want to be thrown on dumb pills… 

Also, I’m a nursing student so I’m currently doing my training at a retirement home, I love it but it also is kind of upsetting… but I do find it isn’t rlly affecting me as much as I anticipated which I’m glad I guess. I do get kind of sad, but I’m pretty sure everyone would seeing certain living conditions of the vulnerable.

"Anxiety after breaking a pinky toe, fear of blood clots an fear of baby aspirin causing bleeding Hello,It is 2 am and i am in full panic mode and overthinkig. 10 days ago i broke my pinky toe and i am super scared of blood clots. I saw a Urgent care doctor, and made 3 online consultations with orthopedic doctors so basically 4 doctors they all said that for injuries like that blood thinners are not suggested. Well as i have health anxiety and my mom passed after a surgery now i have a huge fear of blood clots , so one of the doctors suggested baby aspirin 100 mg just as a preventive for 30 days and to put my mind at ease. Well this opened another can of worms as now i am on full panic mode for internal and brain beeding caused by the aspirin. Ijust took my 5 tablet..i take 1 tablet 100 mg every day and i am panicking about brain bleeds. so without the aspirin i am terrified of blood clots, with the aspiring of brain bleeds. The more i ask the scar it gets and more confused i become. as well it doesnt seem like a broken toe is a big deal for orthopedic doctors, not my clot problem , nor the aspirin proble but for me is a huge deal and constant fear and panick and overthinking.

"Any advice for ppl with health anixety? I'm 19f, I never had health anixety growing up. When I turned 18 I got a job as a secuity guard. My shift was at a homeless shelter and this lady had a cute puppy. The puppy was very excited to see me and she ended up scraping her teeth against my hand, which caused swelling and redness. 

I didn't have any type of medical insurance at the time so I couldn't exactly afford to get it checked out. I starred completely overthinking it, thinking I was gonna get rabies. I told my dad how I felt and he completely brushed me off. I generally thought I was gonna die and I ended up writing ""goodbye"" letters to my family just in case. (Bit dramatic) 

After I finally convinced myself that I didn't have rabies, I thought it was finally over. Until i moved out of my dad's house, and moved in with my biological mother. (She's helped so much and understands me) I used to smoke weed everyday, until one day I smoked and I ended up getting an ice pick headache right after. I thought it was a thunderclap headache, and convinced myself I was gonna die. I went to the er and got a CT scan, and blood work. They said everything is perfectly fine. I still don't understand why I got an ice pick headache. Maybe stress? During that time I wasn't sleeping good at all. I'm not sure.


I've been to the ER at least 5-6 times in the last two months because I'm always convincing myself that I am dying from some horrible disease. They run blood tests and they said I'm fine. And that it's my anxiety. I know deep down I'm perfectly healthy, but It's like my anixety is constantly saying ""You're gonna die, something is wrong."" And if i have ANY symptoms I google them and come across things that I convince myself I have. 


My uncle passed away from esophageal cancer last year, he didn't have a healthy lifestyle, he did hard drugs and drank alcohol. They believe that's what caused it, but I am TERRIFIED that it's genetic. No one else is my family has had it except him, my mom has told me there is no history of genetic medical conditions of any sort in our family, and she tries to remind me that it's just my anixety. 


I have IBS, and anytime I get a stomach pain, or acid reflux, I always assume it's esophageal cancer now. The last few days I've been obsessing over this. My anixety wants me to get an endoscopy, but I'm trying to be reasonable with myself. I have literally no symptoms. 


I just feel like I'm going crazy. Once I go to the doctor and get tests done for the thing im worried about, I just start obsessing over something else on my body. I'm so tired of it. I don't know how to convince myself that nothing is wrong with me.

"Terrible anaphylaxis and MCAS fear taking over my life - I never head food allergy in my life Recently, after reading about MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome), I developed severe OCD and health anxiety about having anaphylactic shock and potentially dying.

"Anxiety gotten somewhat worse  I’ve always been a nervous person. But a couple years ago I had a serious of anxiety attacks that led to one big panic attack. It was new to me and I had never experienced something so intense and scary. It definitely has changed me. I was doing really well until I had the flu in April of this year. Weirdly, it’s made me feel more panicky about my health. 

I had the full nine yards. Lately coming out both ends. I haven’t puked since I was a kid and when I got sick that night it was so unexpected. And not to be dramatic but the feeling is like non forgettable. lol. Like puking. I’d rather have diarrhea x10 than puke lmao. Imo puking is like the worst feeling ever. Obviously nobody enjoys it!

Anyways! So then I’m more nervous of like having my stomach hurt. Like wondering if I’m going to be sick. Especially at work it can be bad. Like working myself up to the point where I feel like I could puke. Or thinking what if I can’t breath. And that gives my the sensation of thinking I’m on the brink of puking.  I never do, all because I’m paranoid. I was doing much better until a couple nights ago I had really bad diarrhea and again, thought I was going to puke. Next day at work I felt anxious and barely ate. No appetite. All because I’m worried. When in reality I’m totally healthy. Then in the night I wake up feeling really sick to my stomach and thought I was going to puke. Like I’m always working up into these scenarios. Then it makes me exhausted the next day because I’m just emotionally drained. So last few days have been getting back to managing it again. 

So many people just would not understand what it’s like to go through this. Like there’s such a difference between being someone who can be nervous than someone who’s got anxiety. Because I feel like my day to day life is just ran by it and I have very little control. 

I always know when I have an attack because it’s such an indescribable feeling. I’m sure it’s different for everyone. But it’s like this tingly sensation crawling up my neck and up through my head. 

I know people have it worse than me. But dealt like sharing. ",anxiety

"3 month long health anxiety flare-up: going insane. I'm tired and I need advice/reassurance/whatever. i'm driving myself and my parents insane over this and i feel so stupid and dumb and crazy. i've cried like 3 times this week alone.

For some background, what started out as a visit to a traumatologist in late august to finally determine what was causing my chronic headaches + neck and shoulder pain has turned into a three month-long health anxiety spiral for me with tons of weird symptoms that come and go and wax and wane as they please and i honestly don't know why or how to stop it. To recap:

1. First it was my usual combo of headaches + neck/shoulder pain that didn't seen to get any better with the treatment plan the doctor gave me, alongside weird zapping/wet sensations in my scalp (like water running down your scalp). This lasted until around mid-september probably. I still get the pain everyday but the weird sensations in my head have mostly stopped.
2. Starting early october i got a weird case of nausea where every morning i would get nauseous and puke only in the morning before and after eating breakfast, mostly water and my breakfast alongisde some diarrhea, bloating and most persistently, a strange feeling of being lightheaded. Not dizzy, more like, having my head literally in the clouds, feeling faint and hazy. We went to our family doctor and got some medicine that alleviated the nausea and vomiting, i told him about the weird head feeling but he said it was most likely fatigue from vomiting. Despite this, to this day the weird head feeling still remains and sometimes it turns into a weird pressure that envolves my whole scalp + neck/traps or a regular headache. i've noticed it gets much better at night. The nausea also comes and goes.

Now, the head feeling isn't particularly distruptive or anything, at least compared to how it was at the start. I can still think, go outside and get stuff done and pretend i'm fine and dandy. But it's been almost a month since the initial flare-up and the fact it hasn't gone away nor significantly worsened nor eased and consistently gets better at night makes me feel very uneasy.  I'm trying to tell myself it's most likely my anxiety playing tricks on me because i can't stop thinking about it (and i do have a history of somatizing symptoms) but no matter how hard i try to stop myself from overthinking and thkning its something more serious. my mind keeps alternating between thinking i have a brain tumor or iih, even though realistically it's impossible, if i had these i'd literally be bedridden and unable to form a coherent thought, let alone talk or think or write this reddit post, but it's so hard. i don't remember how i used to feel before. It's like my body forgot how i used to feel before my health anxiety flare-up started. I feel so scared and lonely.

What's not helping my anxiety in the slightest is the fact i feel like a burden to my parents. They try to be supportive but they can't hide the fact they're getting kinda tired of hearing me complaing everyday ab out a new ailment. And i understand that, i really do, but i'm just desperate. i'm used to always bottling up how i feel. I just want them to listen and comfort me without me feeling guilty about it and withotu them complaining ab out it later. Complicating things further is that we live in a third world country where the healthcare system is an absolute joke and medicine is, if not super expensive, non-existent. A week ago my aunt when to a government funded doctor's office because she had a headache from hypertension and the doctor told her, verbatim ""just take some water with salt and you'll feel better"".

At least not all news are bad. Earlier today i went to uni with some nausea and had a free eye exam just to assuage my fears of having iih. the exam only found out i had myopia in my right eye, but i'm still nervous and anxious. i  finally told my mom about the weird head pressure and my fears about having iih. she laughed at me and said i was too young to worry about such things, but at least she was supportive and said i should get an mri sometime and another more comprehensive eye exam. we've also scheduled a therapy appointment to see if i can finally get diagnosed. fingers crossed i can go back to normal again...

"Is there something the doctor could do about this? So normally, I don't really have anxiety much at all. But when I do, It's REALLY bad!

To understand why it's so bad. You need to understand, I've been really depressed. Very apathetic towards life. Not sad. Just extremely indifferent. Ive gone back and forth and back and forth on why I'm like this. I'm really strongly starting to believe that Trazodone is playing a huge part in it.

My depression is at it's worse in the morning with me being emotionally blunted and feeling like I can't walk straight. The grogginess goes away after an hour or two, but the emotional bluntness stays.

It's not until like 12 hours after I wake up. I start to behave differently. I'm way more interested in what im doing and even put off going to bed because I actually feel happy!
Looking up grogginess and trazodone on reddit, You'll see alot of other people complain about the same thing im dealing with in the morning. I tried an experiment a few months back with trazodone where I only took 12.5mg's for 20 days to see if i start feeling better. While I didn't notice anything. I swear it has to be trazodone! I can't find any other plausible reason as to why this is happening to me. And so... I want to make a real effort to be off trazodone for at least 2 months to really make sure if it's responsible for my severe morning depression.

There's just one problem...
Whenever I have a really bad night of sleep. There's a chance I'll get this really really bad anxiety attack during the afternoon. It's so bad that I can't think straight. Worse is because I have so little interest in things outside of youtube and daydreaming, I have a really hard time destracting myself.

Is there something the doctor could give me that I could take whenever something like this happens? If you go through my reddit history. Ive made sooooooooooooo many posts about having anxiety attacks over the past 3 years. All relating to sleep. This is so uncomfortable I hate it!!!",anxiety
"Health Anxiety About Hauntavirus About a week ago, my family found out we had a mouse infestation in our house, and we decided to go clean. It took us a while, but we are done now, and seem to have gotten the infestation under better control. The biggest problem is though, we are all feeling sick, so that led to me searching about Hauntavirus. While I’ve heard of it before, I thought it was kind of one of those things you could only get if you literally ate mouse excrements, but BOY WAS I WRONG. That’s when I realized my family has made a grave mistake. You aren’t supposed to sweep/vacuum mice nests and droppings because Hauntavirus is AIRBORNE, and doing so stirs up the Hauntavirus into the air. We are all sick in a similar way. I have always had bad health anxiety, but this is next level. I was even planning out what to do if I end up dying because the mortality rate is so high. I’m terrified I’m going to lose my parents. The other thing is, the incubation time for this virus is up to 2 months, so I have to wait over 2 months to feel safe again. I’ve never felt this scared in my life. I live in a state where it is not common at all, with a total of 6 documented cases ever, but I can’t stop telling myself my family is about to add 4 more to it. I have a therapy appointment tomorrow where I’ll be talking about this, but I just don’t know how I’m supposed to get through this, especially since we are all sick. I’m also on antibiotics right now for a UTI and I can’t tell how much symptoms are from that and the side effects of antibiotics, and what is sickness/possible hauntavirus. I’m terrified. ",anxiety

"school anxiety I’ve had anxiety for a while now. I’ve never gotten diagnosed with it, but once you’ve had it for so long, you know. I’m really thinking about switching to homeschool; but I’m not sure if I should. I stress over almost anything, but one thing I’ve been really stressing about lately is school. For some reason school makes me so anxious. Everyday I have to mentally prepare myself before I go to school, or else I will have a mental breakdown and cry. I try to go into it with a positive mindset but sometimes it doesn’t work. Some days, my anxiety is mild (which is very rare) and most days I feel physically sick to my stomach, or sometimes I will feel dizzy. I really don’t know what causes this anxiety, I really think it’s a social thing. I’m scared of embarrassing myself in public. The thing is, I never feel this way in any other places other than school. Sure, sometimes I get anxious talking to strangers but my anxiety has never been this bad anywhere outside of school. Sometimes I wish I didn’t have to be in such a big classroom, and i wish I could work alone, like one on one with a teacher and that’s how I got my education. Being around so many people everyday just makes me so overwhelmed. I’ve talked about this with my mom and she just told me I’ll grow out of it. I’m not sure I will. I’ve had it for 5 years and I still haven’t gotten rid of it. I know I will never get rid of general anxiety, but when is it gonna stop being so excruciating? I don’t really know what to do. My mom said she wants to take me to the doctor and maybe that will make me feel better. Honestly I think the best option for me is doing homeschooling or something. I can’t live on like this with my everyday life. If I do start homeschooling, I am afraid to lose my social life, and spiral into a depression like I did during COVID.

"Upper wisdom tooth removal without sedation  If that title scares you, then this post is for you. 

36, male, hate doctors and dentists. Hate needles. Hate blood. Hate all of it. 
I hate being sedated even more. 
So when my top left wisdom tooth finally started acting up, I had to combine all those nightmares into one. 
The numbing, the drugs, the blood, the recovery…

It was all a breeze. 3 pokes of a needle that hurt less than a potato chip poking the gums (you know the feeling) and 40 seconds of a professional pushing my mouth around and I was biting gauze and giggling at how easy it was. 

I’ve had no more pain than a single Tylenol can handle and my liquid diet has been delicious honestly. 

If you’re only needing 1 or 2 teeth out and they’re not buried in the jaw bone, you can skip the sleepy time drugs. Just get numb and get it over with. 

Oh and YMMV but I already have less sinus pain and headaches than when I had the tooth. Huzzah. ",anxiety

So around a month ago my dad got diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer. He is doing fine and the doctors have said that everything will be fine in the end which is the best news. (Fingers crossed).

"I can’t relax at school because I keep thinking of something that happened (TW: Suicide) TW: Suicide

Awhile ago I was at school when something really bad happened. I got a text from my sibling saying they were going to off themselves. My sibling is okay now and getting medical support, they seem to be doing better but now every time I am in the building where I got the text I feel so on edge.

It was on a Tuesday when it happened, and I just feel a sense of doom every time I have to be in this building now. I know I probably shouldn’t avoid it but I do. I feel so dumb for this, but it’s made me want to not go to school.

"It always hits when I'm supposed to be calm  Hey there.   It's like 3 am over here and I think I'm almost through this sudden panic attack that lasted for like an hour by now.  I just don't get why it always (or at least very often) hits me when I'm about to go to bed or when I'm just literally chilling and doing nothing that could be a potential trigger. It is always intense, very random and very sudden. And it's always very specific to ""omg I can't breathe, I feel like suffocating... so very lungs and breath specific...  it's driving me insane. 

For a very long time I assumed there has to be something wrong with my lungs but after checking it with multiple doctors... ther never was anything wrong. I was diagnosed with stress related Asthma once but haven't shown any symptoms for way over 5 years. And then it started with very very slight trouble ""getting enough air"" and it got worse and worse.  
It got so bad, I sometimes experience panic attacks that are very extreme. They last for up to 5 hours and once I fell unconcious. Aside from those relatively rare extreme ones, I have panic attacks almost every single day. I mostly manage to survive them with some deep breaths and focussing on something I usually enjoy.  It still remains a pretty exhausting endeavor and sometimes I just feel like giving up because it just is too much at times. I'm almost afraid of going to sleep.  This shit is like an Ouroboros.

"Chest and Left Arm Discomfort Hi everyone. To preface, I am a 25 year old male.

I have always struggled with anxiety throughout my life, but it has been a much more prominent part of my life over the last year or so.

This past January, I had two separate stints in the ER because of chest pain and other symptoms that resembled a heart attack. I had several EKGs, and even an Echocardiogram and everything came back perfectly normal. One instance included extreme chest pain and numbness/tingling in my left arm.

Over the past year, I have started to take Buspar for my anxiety. Things have been fairly normal lately, until last night. I did not get a single second of sleep last night because of this extreme “burning” sensation I had in my chest. And, my left arm felt very numb once again.

I never once considered that left arm discomfort could be tied to anxiety, but after reviewing this page I see that several people have experienced this.

If I had not gone to the ER and had the Echocardiogram done earlier this year, I would already be at the ER getting re-checked out. One of the most notable elements of my anxiety has been an increased element of health anxiety. I have been to the urgent care and received blood work around 5 times this year already. My heart rate has not been below 100 bpm all day.

Has anyone experienced these chest pains and left arm discomfort before and how did you resolve it? Since these symptoms mirror a possible heart attack, I am extremely frightened. Thank you!

"October is cursed for me. I have a story and would love advice.  I am diagnosed with G.A.D, Schizophrenia, and some physical stuff that causes seizures. I have been seeing a psych for 5 years and am medicated for everything. The most pressing medication is my Benz as is so often the case. For 4 years I took Ativ at 7mg a day with about 4 other medications. 

The treatment is great. From the ashes of mania and pain I rebuilt my life. I have a happy marriage, a stable job, and a decent life. While you can never defeat anxiety you can get the upper hand in the life long fight. Ok story time

Earlier this month my wife's tire blew up on the highway while I was at work. She was near to the town we grew up in where her parents live and I was 1.5 hours away. I offered to head her way but her dad had volunteered and was much closer. An hour later she is still on the side of a VERY busy highway at night. So I rush out to help and as I arrive her dad arrives. The spare tire had been put on but her dad wanted to back her car down an off ramp to get to a gas station so he could check the other tires. The man is a control freak and extremely abusive.  I wanted to get us off the highway so I told her dad to shove it and tried to snag the keys. He responded by throwing a punch and trying to fight me which I refused to do given we were literally 6 inches from an active highway. In this process, he shoved my wife, his daughter, into traffic and I ran in to yank her out. He left without a word and we went home. The next day, my wife lost her job. She is a surgical technician in training and this was a huge loss. Then after a hurried emergency at my work I got a week's worth of my Benz and Seroquel stolen from my car. Who steals Seroquel? 

Given the stress I was struggling to sleep, being paranoid, and all that jazz. So I took an extra 2mg of my Benz as I have done on very rare occasions in the past (last done in August 2023). I figured the doc would understand and also given my stolen medication, all would be well. The doctor DID NOT understand. 

My doctor has wanted to taper to a lower dose for some time and I have taper down by about 30% over a year. That is slow granted but also I do need this medical mentally and physically. I ran totally out of medication on Tuesday and had to go to the ER and get treated like trash which was great. My doctor vanished and then I guess came in on a day off to talk to me. His response was ""this isn't working for me"" and ""I am done with you"" and he told me to seek detox. His final words were that I love complication so I'd like an overly strict detox program after hanging up. 

I looked into detox and it won't work. 

1. I need this medication. I understand that Benz is not a great long-term medication but I have seizures, paranoia, and anxiety that is so bad most doctors won't treat me. 
2. Going cold turkey, even in a detox program, has a success rate of about 1%. The rate of you know what is like 32% in one study. 
3. The program cost around 10k with insurance and I do not have 10k. My wife is still in school and I cannot just sell my car, quit my job, empty our savings, rob a bank (kidding but you get the point), and abandon her for a month. I'd rather her cash in on life insurance 

I am trying to find a doctor and cannot. 

Now here is what's funny. So when my Doctor called out of the blue he sent over Klonopen for me as an alternative, a medication I have had bad experiences with. While I dislike it still it actually works. I am sleeping, my anxiety is way lower. I think this has completed my treatment finally, right as my doctor decided I am evil. 

What the heck do I do? Keep in mind I have no criminal record, I don't drink, I have no history of medication abuse, and so on. I cannot seem to find a new doctor either though I am really trying. 

Anyone have bad experiences with doctors like this? How did you handle it? What would you do if you were me? Sorry for the long post. I am a writer and a long winded one at that. ",anxiety
"Tips to get rid of chest/body anxiety after mental anxiety has already passed  I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life and have managed it through therapy and meditation. One thing I can’t seem to get a handle on is getting my body to calm down after an intense emotional experience.

"I need some help dealing with work place anxiety. Does anyone have any recommendations? I'm having trouble finding another job and would really appreciate some insight.

I'm having immensely bad anxiety when it comes to searching for another job. For reference I recently left my job at ESS, which was substitute teaching. 

I was a substitute teacher for about 2 years and the job made me extremely anxious and really whittled me down over time, as I was constantly disrespected by students and often disregarded by staff. 

I feel like all of my confidence has eroded away and whenever I apply for another job, regardless of what it does, I get immediately anxious about it being just as bad as when I was substitute teaching. 

I also have OCD and that is just making this situation even worse. I really want to be a productive member of society and contribute as much as I can to wherever I end up employed, but right now I'm just having so much trouble working my way through these emotions. 

What should I do? What resources should I utilize? What do you all think?",anxiety

"Went to a job interview against my ""anxieties"" and still passed Exams, interviews - they scare me to death. I am a perfectionist, I could be hard on myself and unforgiving at times. I got called for an interview for a job I knew I had 50-50 chances. I don't like 50-50 uncertainty and this was giving fear of failing, social embarrassment, to the point I couldn't sleep the night before and had to cancel the following day because I woke up with tingling sensations in my hands. I told myself, if this company let's me reschedule, I will give it another chance and they did. 

On the day of interview, I had to literally drag myself to the face-to-face interview constantly telling myself, this is not a death sentence, I am not going to die if I fail. 

Result: the technical exam did not turn out to be as difficult as I expected it to be. I passed with 80% score. I was able to build a nice rapport with the hiring manager during the interview. I was offered the job.

\--

I know that this is not the end of the struggle. It's going to be a daily challenge of embracing uncertainty in this job where I have a lot to learn on-the-job, but I am deciding to face it one day at a time. So to all those who are dealing with a similar situation, I hope this can inspire you to do the same.   ",anxiety
"I need help I don't know if I'm ok ok. that's a first for me on reddit but this platform kinda helped me in the past but I don't see anyone with my situation so id like to make my own post.

I'm a 21yo woman, I recently graduated and got an apprenticeship in a tattoo studio. that's a lot of change considering I don't always know how to deal with change. in July I also moved in a new appartement so that's a big change too. it's a good appartement but I still dont know if I truly feel home here. that's the same for my job, it's quite stressful considering it's a day to day job, not knowing when you'll have clients or be able to tattoo and stuff. 

but here is the thing. everything is going good. like, that's stupid but the new appartement is bigger in a quieter city, I get to leave my stressful studies to do what I like with my life, and it's been a month and I'm already able to tattoo people so I guess I'm even good at what I'm doing.

still, I had health anxiety my whole life but it really flares when I'm stressed. it flared realllly bad the last few months, going worst and worst. I had nausea (I have emetophobia), I had vertigos and dizziness and that freaked me out so I became hypervigilant about that so I always felt weak and stuff. I also got hypervigilant with my vision because a few years ago I had several aura migraines that terrified me (because of the pain + my eyes going kinda blind for an hour and my body getting numb on one side). Im always scared that the worse is gonna happen and my biggest fear is losing control. control of my thoughts, my body etc. that's the reason I don't drink for example and the reason Why vertigos freak me out so so badly. so I had health anxiety for a few weeks, getting worse and worse. 

and here I am, a few days ago, I had a panic attack/anxiety attack that led to suicidal thoughts. like I get so desperate at that moment my brain only sees that option to cope. but, other than that, I sleep well, eat properly, and when Im not anxious so about 50-60% of my day, Im really really good. like I laugh, I smile and stuff like everything is fine.

but, sometimes during my day, I get randomly really anxious for about 30min to an hour or 2, it depends. during those moments, I truly really really feel like my life is a mess, like I'm convinced I need to commit. that doesn't make sense and I'm scared. during those moments I feel like all the good moments never existed and my life is falling apart, I feel like I'm losing my mind. and when it's over I feel ok I guess?

I truly don't understand what is happening to me and why I'm ok and the next second I'm panicking and feel like I'm seeing my life as a whole mess. I don't know if I try to sabotage myself because everything is quite good in my life and it never happened so my brain needs a problem to focus on? maybe it's my brain not adjusting to the changes in my life? because in those bad moments I also feel like I don't have a ""comfort zone"", like I'm ALWAYS on edge, about to lose it, and I don't have nowhere to rest and feel comfortable. and that's quite true I guess?

I live with my boyfriend of 3 years and were happy so that doesn't make sense that I feel so desperate. everything is good and the only thing that is making me crazy is that I always always always think of the next moment I'll be feeling suicidal again, the next problem in my life, the next bad thing that will happen.

and the funny thing is that it's been 3 days I obsess over those suicidal and very very desperate thoughts, and today for like the first time, I got so busy with these thoughts I didn't have vertigo at all, nor dizziness. that juste proves how that was all in my head. but my brain always needs a bad thing to hyper focus on. I don't want to kill myself, at least I don't think, because these thoughts scare me and I don't understand them at all.

also I have a psy appointment at the end of the month (in 20 days) and I just feel like I'm going mad. why can't my brain just accept that I'm doing ok with my life? I have severe mother trauma that interferes with this I think, thinking that I don't deserve to be happy or that I never do anything good enough so maybe there's that too. 

please help. am I going mad? I need to know if the moments I'm happy during my day and don't think about anything bad are genuine or if I'm just in denial of my life falling apart. I can't tell what version of me is legit. if it's the depressed one wanting to commit or if it's the happy one not thinking about it when busy.

thank you for reading all that btw. I'm so scared of the next time I'll feel down. that happens about 3 times a day I'd say. one when I wake up, one or two during the day, and one in the evening.",anxiety

"Severe anxiety I’ve been a wreck for these past 3 weeks and I think I have severe undiagnosed anxiety. Before I talk about what’s been going on recently, I want to clarify that I’ve had symptoms of anxiety from the ages of 8 years old (I’m now 16). 

My first experience with anxiety was when I had to get a brain scan, I remember them putting the cap on my head and me shitting myself as I thought they were going to literally fry my brain and kill me. I then started experiencing severe derealisation episodes at the age of 9, they often started at very specific times, 6PM to be exact, along with paranoia, and panic attacks from my own delusions, I was petrified of sleeping at night as I thought someone would break in, or I would just simply die in my sleep. Eventually around the ages of 10 or 11, my derealisation became constant and never stopped, I still have it to this day BUT it varies in severity, meaning sometimes it’s very light, or severe. 

That being said, around 3 weeks ago I was laying in bed at around 9PM when all of a sudden I got a wave of severe derealisation and just felt like my brain was “not right”, everything suddenly felt very unfamiliar and alien, this feeling of discomfort then quickly spiralled into a panic attack which lasted the entire night. During the panic attack I was shaking (literally looked like I was seizing), had diarrhoea 3 times, was urinating constantly, had throat congestion, jelly legs, manual breathing, a sudden extreme fear of dying and most of the physical symptoms associated with a panic attack. 

I literally lost my mind, I mean, I was pacing around the room repeating to myself that I was going to die, and was rocking back and forth in bed desperately trying to soothe myself. I eventually fell asleep at around 6AM, but when I woke up the next day, the derealisation did not go away at all, and I was extremely fatigued. Later on, I had another 2 panic attacks which caused the most horrendous physical symptoms, I urinated atleast 10 times and had diarrhoea 5 times. 

On day 3, I was riddled with fear and depression. The moment I woke up, I vomited 4 times, and was extremely fatigued. I went to my local healthcare clinic and had a huge panic attack, and requested an urgent GP appointment. Whilst I was freaking out in the waiting room, I was picking and biting at my lips to the point there was blood dripping off my chin, on top of that I had dirty, unbrushed hair, pale skin, dark under eyes, and pjs on. I looked and felt like a mess. The first urgent GP appointment didn’t do anything, I was just given a self referral service for talking therapy, which I couldn’t access anyways because I was under the age of 17. By then I lost count of days I was experiencing this constant agony, all I remember is 2+ panic attacks a day, until I got another urgent GP appointment, this time I got lucky and was given propranolol, which helped but still gave me anxiety as they lower your blood pressure, it also did not help my derealisation. 

I experienced 2 weeks of debilitating panic attacks, on my last day of having them, I actually hallucinated. I remember suddenly falling to the floor and shaking uncontrollably, I felt my throat inflating, my chest compressing, my entire body going numb, and the impending doom washing over me. A few minutes into my panic attack, I look at my smoke detector which was in the middle of 4 kitchen lights, and I thought it was an angel coming to collect my soul. I took my propranolol and fell asleep at around 7AM, and from there had no panic attacks. 
However, I was instead hit with extreme fatigue, I was literally bed bound from the moment I woke up, I was extremely depressed and mentally drained, it also felt like (and still feels like) I was braindead, I had such bad brain fog, I was literally forgetting thoughts I had moments ago, I also had trouble reading and processing things, and creating logical arguments in my head/scenarios. I was absolutely miserable. 
My anxiety didn’t fully disappear either, it was just the panic attacks, so I still felt the impending doom, fear of dying, and tension. 

I also forgot to mention that I completely lost sense of time, so things that I did a day ago felt like a week ago. 
Anyways, I’m still in a depressed and anxious state, I cant get out of bed until 12PM, I’m also unable to go to college or just outside in general, but I’m able to dress myself and maintain good hygiene. I never thought how bad my mental state could get, I was in college 3 weeks ago and I was absolutely fine, and now I’m a zombie, can anyone else relate?? I hope I can survive this.",anxiety

"How do you deal with anxiety during the holidays? Well it's already November and for me that means experiencing anxiety everyday due to the looming Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.

When I was a kid I had little issue but in recent years I've been on the verge of panic attacks while at these events.

"Waking up every night for months with a panic attack.  
As the title suggests, I’ve been waking up almost every night for the past few months, typically 1–3 hours after falling asleep. I feel trapped in a cycle that I just can’t seem to break, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to manage. Each time I wake up, I’m hit with an overwhelming sense of doom, a racing heart, and hyperventilation.

My mind immediately goes to thoughts of a heart issue—particularly QT prolongation (not something to Google if you have health anxiety). I can’t shake the fear, and when I’ve tried starting Prozac, I’ve attributed these symptoms to QT prolongation caused by the medication. Even hydroxyzine before bed hasn’t helped.

"How to stop compulsive overthinking?  I don’t even know if this is a thing. I am an over thinker and always have been but usually when I need to focus on something like when studying for an exam I could stop and concentrate when I want to even though sometimes an idea would pop in my head and distract me for a few minutes until I “resolve” that idea and quickly get back to studying. This doesn’t waste too much time (7-10 minutes at best and doesn’t happen that frequently so it is like a small break). Now, the issue I am facing currently started recently when I had a misunderstanding with a couple of close friends, which kinda cause us to distance ourselves from each other temporarily (we all believe that it is just a misunderstanding and no one is at fault and temporary distancing we think should be healthy). This is where my problems began. I was the one that suggested we distance a bit so I felt like I destroyed the friend group (I had to distance long story short I fell in love with someone in the group that I could never be with the pain was too much so I had to do this). Anyways, whenever I see them all without me, I fall to pieces and I can’t stop thinking about it to the point that it takes me half an hour and SO MUCH BRAIN ENERGY (I feel very tired afterwards, it is like squeezing your brain so that it doesn’t space out) just to read a single sentence and I wouldn’t even be satisfied with it as I would have multiple thoughts in between this half an hour (so I read two hours, the thought comes back, I take a few minutes suppressing it, then two words, repeat). When this happens I stop studying and take a break that spans a few days (I think I only need 3-4 hours but when you take break unexpectedly and your plan is ruined, especially as a perfectionist straight A college student, the disappointment kills you and you sink deeper and grow apathetic until a few days have gone and now you don’t wanna fail). This only ever happens to me rarely, when there is an external trigger (weird dynamics with my friends now). It makes me seriously wanna die :). Any idea if this is anxiety or if not what else it could be? The kind of thoughts I would get are along the lines of “could I have done this differently”, “was I in the wrong”, “could I do more to fix this”, “maybe I should send more messages”, “no no I don’t wanna come off as annoying” and with this overthinking comes a suffocating chest tightness (I think only for the first couple hours from the trigger).",anxiety

"Huge mistake, lessons learned, but still spiraling in my head I got diagnosed with chronic anxiety and depression just few days ago. And I’m still in a little denial/and or confused.

This morning though… I had the worst episode and my mind was spiraling in negative thoughts. I knew I wasn’t ok and I was overthinking unusually…But I couldn’t stop myself.

My instinct was to call my childhood acquaintance who I haven’t spoken for many many years. For some reason, I dumped all my everything I had in mind. I cut off our catchups and conversations and asked if I could be honest…I just couldn’t stop myself.

I knew I fucked up. I even dumped my marriage concerns and I regret it awfully right now. They were kind to me…but I knew I messed up. 

I decided to find a therapy/counselor/psychiatrist. I’ve already emailed my doctor for a confirmation to get help. 

NOW…I just spent good 5hours not being able to move. Regretting the call. I wish I had a therapist sooner so it was the therapist I called not someone I knew years and years ago. Idk.

"High heart rate *causing* anxiety, can’t take beta blockers? So for like ten years now I’ve suffered with random tachycardia episodes. PVCs and PAC’s started at the same time, too. Ten years ago. 

Anyway. When I try taking the lowest dose of beta blocker (bisoprolol) it lowers my heart rate too much when I sleep and also, it lowers my blood pressure too. I didn’t need my blood pressure lowered. 

My tachycardia has been ruled out for many years as just being ‘random’ and maybe IST? And for a very long time I just ignored it and got on with my life. Had another baby even (that’s how un-anxious I am as a person haha).

However…. Fast forward to now, the random tachycardia episodes have increased and are just getting on my nerves. It worsens when I’m just relaxing in the couch in the evenings, and then ramps up even more when I lay down in bed and try to sleep. It’ll increase from 75 to 90-110 just laying there.

I had an endoscopy performed on August 6th (everything came out clear) but the following day I had a very strange dizziness/unsteady feeling, my body felt heavy/weak, and I had moments of body tingling, fatigue and nausea. I figured it was from the anesthesia since I had never had it before, but I am 3 months out from my procedure and it’s continued to happen everyday. Since then I’ve had multiple blood panels, a brain MRI, and abdominal/pelvic and chest CT, a heart sologram, wore a heart monitor for 3 days and have yet to find any answer to my problems. My doctors believes that it’s anxiety/depression related since I’ve had history of panic attacks and worry very frequently, but this just feels so much different than what I’ve felt in the past. I just want to feel like myself again and my doctor is pushing towards antidepressants, but I don’t feel that depressed.. just very worried that I have something wrong with me because what I’m feeling is very real. If I didn’t feel these physical symptoms, I really don’t think I would have any issues. I had a very good friend of mine pass away 4 days before my procedure, so I believe my doctor is basing all my issues off that, but I really believe there is something going on with me. Life has been hell and i’m hoping to find someone who has also dealt with issues like this, and if antidepressants helped with recovery. ",anxiety

"Giant sepsis scare So basically it all started from me realizing I have pericoronitus from a wisdom tooth coming in… 
It doesn’t hurt too much, only a little bit from when I bite down while I am eating food and I already went to a dentist and got checked and she said it was not infected or anything and to just get the wisdom tooth out and connected me to an oral surgeon 
I haven’t gotten the surgery yet but am super scared im gonna get sepsis
My heart rate is around 80 - 95 from the anxiety I havent been able to eat properly for the last couple of days due to stress and I feel like im going insane
My bp is also around 100/70 but fluctuating to as low as 96/67 which is even scarier 
My temperature has been nowhere above 98.7 and nowhere below 97.4.
I have been also extremely tired and I have minimal appetite 
I am also on fluvoxamine which may be causing the tiredness and minimal appetite right???
Nonetheless, I am scared shitless. 
Please help and support me or give reassurance

"Lorazepam for anxiety and problems related to it. I've been taking lorazepam daily for like 3 years. I've developed a pretty severe addiction to it. If I try to skip taking it, I get a really bad anxiety attack within 10 hours. Sometimes I can get pretty far but as soon as ""oh, I haven't taken my medication today"" crosses my mind, it's all downhill from there. Instant anxiety or panic or both. It sucks because it really helps me, but being addicted is horrible. ",anxiety

"My life feels like hell since I have anxiety... I (19F) barely experienced intense or chronic anxiety my whole childhood or teenagehood (even tho I had one panic attack in high school it was really something punctual).

But after an intense summer of working and spending the last two weeks in a horrible heartbreak (he cheated on me) and then brutally changing environment from the fresh air of mountains to the grey and depressive Paris, I felt so exhausted and overwhelmed by everything I wanted to stop my theatre classes after the second class I took. I felt like an incapable trash and each day going by I just kept telling myself that life is too hard for me to handle. And for the first time in life, I had suicidal thoughts that weren't just intrusive... And since I felt like they were tangible, I panicked and had a huge panic attack. 

Since that exact moment, I've started feeling anxiety. Strong anxiety. And it was even more scary because I felt like everything I ever knew changed.

Before, I used to escape in my head, focusing on what was coming next to survive the moment I was leaving. But now looking forward to the future really makes me uncomfortable and it felt like I lost my only way to cope.

Since I have anxiety, everything seems bleak, hard and my self-esteem is buried in the ground. It's so hard dealing with panic attack so often, intense one at that. Especially since I didn't have them before.

I have medication for anxiety but that doesn't really help at all. 

What helps me is someone being there and supporting me, but because of that, I feel like a huge burden, especially because my ""best friend"" is super mean to me in the moments I need her most.

I mean, last time I called the samu (a french helping line that can get you an ambulance as well as just put you in touch with a doctor) because I had such a huge headache I couldn't handle it, but they were so mean to me because I wasn't able to find the address so they ironically made fun of my ""stupidity"" and put me on the longest waiting list he could have put me on. That made me panic I had a huge panic attack I was trying to hide but couldn't. She came to me and asked me what was wrong I told her briefly about the samu thing and the only thing she found to tell me was ""That's normal they got angry we don't call the samu for that"" I was like ??? And then she tried to tell me it was ridiculous wanting to go to class while calling the samu when I just couldn't think right at that moment so I didn't know what to do I couldn't think of anything. I talked to her about it later and she apologized and I told her what's best if she wants to help is just to stay here with me and don't talk.

Yesterday was also pretty traumatic; I had a huge panic attack coming. I asked her if she could step out with me for a sec because I was feeling really bad and she got angry at me by saying me in a very rude tone : ""I know you don't like how I'm reacting but I just don't wanna miss my class. Me too I have panic attack everyday but like right now you're just bringing me down so now I'm gonna go back because I don't want to miss my chance to show my work because if you."" (It was just for a few minutes on a 3-hour class...) Given the fact that I didn't go to school for the past 2 weeks before that, I just felt like a fucking burden like she was just telling me she was better off with me. And that was so violent I mean that's my best friend I trusted her, I needed her and that hurt me and my self-esteem deeply. 

Especially since she never told me she was not going well and she knew she could have told me if she felt overwhelmed by what I'm going through and the fact that I talk to her about it... But she didn't tell me anything I just got her frustration in my face in a middle of an important panic attack.

And I just hate that situation I keep going back and forth to anger and guilt... I couldn't even go to class today...

Also I keep having weird interactions with people since I have anxiety I feel like I always do the wrong thing or what I do gets interpreted really badly and I just feel like a burden even to stranger.

All of that to say : everything got complicated since I have anxiety. My relationships, my way of living. And gosh therapy takes so long to fix things I want them fixed quickly...

I'm feeling desperate and depressed. When I feel better things brags me even deeper into a depressive state...",anxiety
"Have you ever had a similar experience? It was a few days before Christmas when I was laying in bed and looking at my bookshelf, and I thought to myself ""Be kind to your family, as it might be your last Christmas together"", then it immediately flashed into me, an intense emotion, that I was going to be the one dead. It wasn't a thought, I wasn't thinking ""What if it was me"", more like an emotion that I knew what it meant. I was shocked after that. I'd never experienced such an intense, sudden emotion before that. Like lightning, it struck into me out of nowhere.",anxiety
"My sister’s health anxiety is destroying the family  My older sister has dealt with health anxiety and OCD (I think that the two are linked) since as long as I can remember. She used to confide in me about it but now she pushes me and our family away and has become resentful towards us. 

She screamed at our stepdad last night and told him that she hopes he kills himself from the guilt after she dies because he didn’t believe that she has a terminal illness and that we will all have blood on our hands when she dies. 

She becomes a different person when she thinks that she’s dying. She thought that she had kidney failure last week and the results came back that she’s fine but she is still convinced there’s something wrong. 

She had a keratin treatment (chemical hair straightening) done a couple months ago and is convinced that it is given her cancer because the hairdresser got some of the solution on her skin.
When she got home she started shouting at our mum and stepdad and broke down in tears. 

She cut off all of her hair a couple days ago and every time she leaves her room it’s to pick a fight with someone. My stepdad told me that he doesn’t know how to talk to her anymore because it’s him that she targets the most. 

She’s 19 but has spent her entire teenage years hiding away in her room and obsessing over her health. 

I don’t know how to help her. Once she has it in her head that something is wrong she becomes impossible to reason with. I want to help because it’s causing so much tension within the house.

"Talk therapy alternatives I'm wondering what success people have had with forms of therapy aside from talk therapy for their anxiety. For the better part of my life I have sought therapy for my anxiety with little success. Ive done typical talk therapy, cbt, and dbt with very little long term success. The most helpful was dbt as i also learned a lot of coping skills, but as I get further into my adult life I desire tackling these issues at their root. I've considered EMDR to help with the trauma and distress that contributes to me anxiety, and am curious as to others experiences with it and eith other more ""hands on"" forms of therapy!",anxiety
"Cardiophobia despite it all I have suffered with anxiety for a long time now but with medication and coping methods I have come a long way. Still the one thing that keeps coming back is cardiophobia. I have had ECG's done several times just this year either by EMT's or in the hospital. I've had my blood pressure monitored and have had soooo many blood tests. I see my doctor regularly and apart from needing to lose some weight he has not been concerned about my current health status. Despite all this I still get anxious when I exercise and get my heart rate up, when I eat something that feels less than heart healthy, or when I have any kind of pain in my chest or back area.   
I am very observative about my health, most people would say too much so. As I said I have put myself through the emergency room like 3-4 times this year and have been to my doctor's office 3-4 times this year. So if I have something that feels wrong I'm quick to seek medical help. So far however there was only one time that something even remotely serious had happened, I had a bleeding ulcer from taking too many SAIDs.

I think my manager would be understanding, but I also wonder how much is appropriate to disclose to her about my current mental health struggles and still be professional. I love and need my job, but I want to be honest that I need more support and probably more time off (I have a massive amount of banked time off). I have drafted an email to her, but I haven’t sent it.

"Does anyone recognize this kond of anxiety? Hi all,

I'm struggling with anxiety for over 10 years, some years it was ok and I could live fairly well without to much worrying.

The anxiety I know I have is social anxiety but I have grown out of that which is very good.

But since my burnout early 2023 I had a lot of dizzyness and nausea and these gave me anxiety because I felt like an alien with these symptoms.

Now nearly 2 years later and nearly one year on Lexapro (slowly tapering now and nearly off of it) I still have this kind of anxiety I can't describe, it's a lingering feeling about .. nothing?

I'm not scared of anything I just feel off and absent some days, and when I feel like it's one of those days when my stomach aches and I feel absent my brain is like oh no not again .. why can't I heal out of this .. Will it ever stop? 

Then I go on Google to fix the issue .. but there is no issue ? 😩😩😩

Mostly I feel fine though, just this one lingering thing. Sorry for the huge text.",anxiety

"Feeling ill while anxious. Hi, so for some context I’ve had pretty bad anxiety for the past few months, but recently it’s got a lot worse, to the point that I just feel really really ill a lot of the time. On top of that, the idea that I might actually throw up makes me more anxious, so I end up just not eating. As silly as it sounds, not eating feels more right in this situation. 

Basically, this is impacting my social life, so much so that I struggle to do things with friends and in particular my girlfriend. I’ve been to a couple of parties with her recently and before, when I’m about to leave, I just get hit with waves of nausea and have actually thrown up a few times.

"My anxiety is irrational Ive (21M) been suffering from some kind of anxiety (been visiting therapist but not psychiatrist yet, so i dont have diagnosis) for almost 3 years. It shows mainly as nausea and stomach pains (according to several tests my body is healthy) with no consistent trigger. I manage going to school and family gatherings, i dont mind other people (shopping, bank, gym), but i have problem with planned spending time with friends. If i run into someone unexpectedly its okay, but knowing theres a party next week (or god forbid, a date) i am experiencing literal somatic pain. Sometime it goes away before said event, sometime during and sometime it doesnt. Never figured the factors other then its planned and with people i know. The place, amount of people or gender doesnt seem to matter. Also worth mentioning ive always been outgoing and mentally stable and this changed from day to day. So almost immediately i had to drop most of my hobbies (choir, sports, camping) and over time im losing friends and rejecting potentional romantic partners due to sheer inability to show up. So even tho my pain is mostly physical and i usually dont have anxious thoughts, i am inevitably spiralling into depression, not because i feel subjectively terrible, but my life is objectively terrible. Distancing myself from all friendly interactions works contraproductively, so the best i can do right now is forcing myself to attend at least something, even if i am in pain, otherwise i would socially degenerate.

Does anyone have some experience with anything similar?

"i get anxious when someone’s a little cold to me (25F) I’ve kinda fallen in love with someone lately and each time he’s a little bit cold to me(or is simply busy), i get anxious 🤡. It makes me feel so stupid that one person can even have that much impact on my mood, but i think there’s a good reason for it. I’m really lonely. Like, i don’t have many people in my life, no family anymore, no friends, only roommates And they don’t even like me and kinda bully me. So yeah, when the one person i like, who is so sweet to me, is a little less sweet, or gives me less attention than normal, i’m scared he‘s not into me anymore. I talked to my therapist about it too, he said: “Your world is so small, because you don’t have many people in it. If something like this would happen to someone with a bigger social life, it would impact them less, than it does for you.” Which makes sense, but it doesn’t help. I’m not good at making friends.

"My thoughts on the DARE program I just wanted to share my thoughts on the popular DARE program because I see nothing but glowing reviews online and I haven't had a very positive experience. This is only my experience and my opinion so it may work for other people. I read the book and used the app, and then I did DARE academy. I really didn't like how it made a lot of promises like ""you will see results in a short period of time if you do this simple thing"" and made claims like ""all you need is DARE"" (this was literally one of the daily DARE audios). But when I went through the DARE academy, there were a lot of people who didn't seem to be feeling better, myself included, but the response to it is always ""you're just not accepting your anxiety fully"" or ""you're just not fully committing yourself to DARE."" This gives me an icky faith healing vibe, not to mention when some people continued to express their frustration, they were told they just needed to get a therapist or get on medication. I didn't like this either because it was so contradictory to the promises that were made in the beginning and the claims that all you need to do is DARE. I just generally find the program to be scammy and culty, and didn't gain much from it except for the core concept that anxiety disorders get worse when you become fixated on fighting the anxiety. This is not something I had to spend hundreds of dollars to learn, and I felt more relief from watching Anxiety Guy videos on YouTube (his surrender session videos are similar in concept). I just felt like I spent a lot of money thinking I was going to get extra guidance and support, but all I really felt was criticism by the DARE coaches for not ""getting it."" I also felt the approach was very one size fits all and didn't recognize that anxiety stemming from trauma can look really different and need more somatic approaches than more cognitive, generalized anxiety. Anyway, telling myself that I accept my anxious feelings over and over again did not really help my anxiety. I don't want to discourage anyone from trying DARE or argue with anyone who found success with it, but I wanted to offer a different perspective from what I usually see on here about DARE.

"Struggling with physical symptoms Hi all

I have had an anxiety disorder for years and have had my ups and downs and generally can get a handle on things. I'm on a good med combo and see my therapist once a month. 
However the last few weeks the physical symptoms have been kicking my arse.
Heart palpitations, major dizziness, muscle tension, tmj pain, headaches, can't relax, can't catch my breath etc.

I am going through a stressful period - in the process of buying a house, I'm a teacher with a particularly tricky class that are very draining and the thought of having to teach them until July fills me with dread! I've got two after school parent evenings this week that I'm dreading because I'm so worried the physical symptoms will take over. 

I can't get a drs appointment, not that they can do anything. I don't want to change my meds and I'm already seeing a therapist. I'm trying to do breathing exercises, meditation, leaving work at work etc. I haven't made it to the gym in weeks because I'm exhausted after work. I'm basically main lining kitkats at work as a stress eat my feelings. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this as I don't editthink there's anything that can help but just wanted to reach out. I did a presentation to staff yesterday about looking after your mental health and here I am swirling the plug hole!

If you got this far, sorry for the ramble, any and all suggestions welcome.

"I’m so exhausted of feeling horrifically anxious and nauseous every morning I’m just at the end of my rope here.  Every single morning I wake up and have to deal with 3-4 hours of pretty intense nausea/anxiety/hot flashes.  I’m a 39-year old guy who has been a methadone patient for about 9 years now, and I smoke pot every day and have been smoking pot every day since I was about 15, barring a few years I took off here and there.  I was on Klonopin for anxiety (3mg every day) for about 7 years as well, but it’s now been 4 years since I stopped taking it after a year or so of tapering.  This morning misery started at the time when I stopped taking Klonopin and I’ve been ascribing it to benzo withdrawal, but 4 years?  It’s not as bad or as constant as it was, but it’s more than bad enough still.

I mean, I get up and just feel AWFUL.  After 3 or 4 hours of exhausting pacing, often while pinching myself because focusing on a point of pain is the only way I can keep from vomiting.  Hot showers used to help a little, but not so much anymore.  I sometimes think it may have to do with altitude, because these symptoms also started when I moved from sea level to living at 9000 feet above sea level in Colorado.  But then I was back on the east coast this summer and I was still dealing with this bullshit, though it wasn’t so bad.  

I know I could get probably go back on a daily benzodiazepine regimen and it would probably go away, but that would be tantamount to admitting that I’m going to spend the rest of my life on benzodiazepines, and I really don’t want to do that.  The two drugs I currently use on a daily basis don’t affect my ability to function, but I can’t say the same about benzodiazepines.  I felt like they were steadily destroying my brain cells and making me dumber month by month, year by year.  ",anxiety
"Exposure therapy How does everyone feel about exposure therapy? Catch me a month ago not being scared of anything and now I can barely drive without freaking out.

There have been weeks where I only got 3 hours of sleep per day, but I still made it to work . The tightness in my chest comes and goes ,but it won't kill me. I've had all the symptoms by now (mine rotate on and off) so I know I'll survive. I may forget how bad it really was before, but I know it's better now even if it still sucks.

"Anyone else have sensitivity to loud noises and music?  I realized that I have issues with noise. It makes me irrationally mad. For instance when in my partner’s car, he plays hard rock. I used to like that kind of music but I outgrew it. After 10-15 min, I literally cannot stand it anymore and I have to ask to turn it off. Also when in social situations when music is playing loudly and people singing or people yelling over each other, I just can’t stand it. I feel so out of control I just shut down, counting down the minutes until I can leave. I literally can’t even hear myself thinking. Are there any specific things that help with that? I’m getting a lot of pressure to visit family where I would have to be around everyone for 2-3 days and I feel like I’m going to explode on someone, which I already did the last time I went there.

I went through a lot at the end of that relationship and quickly forgot all about hvs2 as a topic at all when I fell in love with this man I am with now.

"Was this a panic attack? So I'm almost positive I just had a panic attack (I've had a couple in the past also), but my health anxiety is saying it was definitely not, and that I'm gonna die. So for the past couple of days, I've had a persistent headache. It had been better this morning. It wasn't gone, but the pain was less intense than it had been. The headaches (and some other recent events in my life) have had me really stressed, making me think I have a brain tumor or something, which is already a huge fear of mine. Anyways, I was doing some really routine things this morning, and I bent over to pick something up, and my headache really flared and the pain spiked. My first thought was that that DEFINITELY meant I DO have a brain tumor. I straightened up, still thinking about brain tumor shit, and I starting shaking, getting really dizzy, my heart started racing, I was feeling lightheaded, getting chills while sweating, and my muscles got all weak and ""jelly"" like. I went inside (this happened outside) and layed down for a couple of minutes. I tried to take some deep breaths because my breathing was kinda fast, and I listened to something that helps distract and calm me down. I still couldn't stop shaking, and I got a lot of horrible intrusive/racing thoughts. I eventually started to feel better, but I was still a bit shaky and a little nauseous. Sorry if this is long, I just wanna have all the details laid out. Do you guys think this was a panic attack, or was it something physical like health anxiety is trying to say? It's so hard for me to even know what are real, physical symptoms, and what are just anxiety symptoms anymore. 


By the way, I typically am pretty dizzy, tend to sweat a lot, have intrusive and racing thoughts, some mild compulsive behavior, irritability, and just overall have typical anxiety symptoms. I'm diagnosed with GAD, and have been on Zoloft for years. I did therapy for 2.5 years and didn't really see results. I'm currently meditating 15-25 minutes a day, I'm active, I eat healthy, try to get 7.5-8 hours sleep most nights, and drink a ton of water. I've only recently (past 8-10 months) began to struggle with health anxiety, but I've had generalized anxiety my entire life. I would really appreciate any advice you guys have.",anxiety

"Seeking advice on overcoming health-related anxiety affecting my sleep

 About ten days ago, I used to sleep peacefully for a solid 7 hours. However, last Tuesday, I received some upsetting news about my health, and since then, anxiety has been keeping me up. Throughout the day, I feel mostly normal—definitely not perfect, but somewhat stable. Yet, when it comes time for sleep, I can only manage 4-5 hours. I keep waking up early in the morning (around 4-5 AM) with intense anxiety and negative thoughts flooding back.

I've been trying various natural techniques to combat anxiety, and while they help during the day, nights are still difficult. Has anyone else gone through something similar? Are there any natural remedies or methods that could help me fall asleep and stay asleep without that early morning anxiety? Would really appreciate any advice or experiences you can share.",anxiety

I don’t snore or think I have any sleeping apnea or related but ofc not sure.

And the pain has spread. No amount of ibuprofen or aspirin makes it actually go away. It's always here and always hurts. 

I think it's a pinched nerve.
Yes I let my doc know. Yes I plan to monitor and report. Yes I will request a ct scan. Yes I've had blood tests that show I'm fine. 

I'm just tired of feeling this and assuming the worst. ""it's cancer and it's spreading"". or ""it's a heart attack"". or ""you're developing a kidney infection. you're gonna die"". 

Yes I got blood tests. Yes I'm receiving care. I just want to get my brain to realize I'm genuinely probably not actually sick with a deadly rare illness. I'm so exhausted of how scared I am of... probably nothing. 

God. I'm thankful for tik tok but it has SEVERELY increased my medical fear. I'm constantly seeing ""at first it was (insert mild symptom), turns out it was (very rare or uncommon disease/illness). And then you see hundreds and hundreds of comments of ""that was me too!"" and I'm just like... is it that common? Could I very well be becoming ill and just not know it? 


Why am I like this!?! Is it because I had a random kidney infection years ago? I thought it was just a tummy ache, so I ignored it until I developed a fever and severe pain. I guess it just feels like I'm about to experience sudden onset pain, discomfort, and illness. Now when I experience severe pain, I become pretty scared. 


Anyone else deal with this? What helps to cope? I promise I'm not reassurance seeking. I just want to know what techniques others have used that really help break this fear down. I'll ask my therapist also, but we only meet up every 2 weeks and he never answers my emails :(.

"Any of ya all feel HORNY while being depressed with OCD but regret it later  I’m hoping to find some understanding and perhaps some advice. I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for a while, and I’ve noticed a strange pattern: during my low moments, I often feel an intense surge of sexual energy. It’s really confusing because, at the same time, I feel so down and hopeless. Recently, I watched some porn, and while it gave me a temporary distraction, it ultimately left me feeling even more depressed and horrible afterward.

To complicate matters further, I also struggle with OCD, which makes it really hard for me to engage in masturbation or even enjoy any kind of sexual release. I feel like my sexual life is getting suppressed, yet there’s this constant, conflicting push and pull between feeling horny and feeling utterly depressed. It’s frustrating and isolating.

"I can’t live like this anymore. Hi! I hope whoever reads this is doing well and thank you in advance to clicking on my post. 

I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember. I noticed it in high school, but I’m positive it has been there my whole life. I was always a “jumpy” or paranoid kid, according to my family. In reality, I’m sure I was just anxious. Anyway, my anxiety has now gotten to a point where I’m not sure if I can spend the rest of my life dealing with it.

My anxiety manifests itself as a “highlight reel” in my head playing every mistake, embarrassing moment, and regret over and over. I can’t stop it from happening, no matter how many times I tell myself to be present in the moment. It’s especially bad days after something embarrassing happens. I can recognize that no one finds these moments important, but that doesn’t stop me from feeling incredibly bad about myself. Additionally, I am in a bad financial state as I lost my job last December and recently ran out of my savings. I have CC debt and a student loan I can’t pay, so I randomly get reminded of my financial ruin alongside my other mistakes. It’s all becoming too much. I broke down and cried for hours because I can’t turn the thoughts nor the physical response to them off (headache, insomnia, heart palpitations, upset stomach). I stopped talking about it with my family and friends because as well intentioned as they are, they can’t save me from my own mind. And I don’t want to worry them.

I tried meds. I was on Celexa for 10 years and it helped my depression tremendously, to the point it’s not really a problem. BUT my anxiety? Nothing helps except for Valium and I took those bc my Mom gave me hers (I stopped because I was beginning to abuse them).

I don’t know what to do. I can’t and WILL NOT live like this for the rest of my life. Am I broken? Should I just factory reset this whole thing and hope to come back as a normal human being? I truly don’t know what to do.",anxiety

Guys. I don’t know how to even begin talking so this message might be a cluster of babble but I’ll end up re typing and end up writing nothing at all if I pay too much attention so sorry in advance.

The diseases and things I get extremely anxious about are usually severe viral infections. Even though I know they are extremely rare and have a low chance of being something I have, I still have lingering gut feelings about it, mainly based on other factors that I won’t get into here but I can’t shake them.

I don’t even know how to approach my gp about getting tested for anything i mentioned as I already know when i explain I’ll be instantly gas lit and not taken seriously enough to proceed in testing. 

For anyone who has/is going through the same. How on earth do I go about this. ",anxiety
"Work is destroying my mental health This is my first post and more venting than anything. I hope this is allowed. 

My job is wrecking my mental health in two ways. First, the social aspect. I’ve been there two months. I’m part time because I can’t handle more. I work in the care sector. I thought I’d been getting better socially but I’m having a really hard time with criticism. I’m still learning but making small mistakes and forgetting things is causing anxiety. I’m finding that I physically can’t speak both at work and in social interactions outside of work, and it’s getting worse. I’m having extra jobs thrown at me despite having adjustments related to my mental health where I’ve stated I need predictably and routine and getting tasked changed on the spot is causing my anxiety to sky rocket. 

Second is related to pay. I haven’t been paid in the (just over) 2 months I’ve worked there. First month, I didn’t get told I needed to do timesheets so I missed my first pay. I was due the pay for everything I’ve worked so far on the 31st October and found I haven’t been paid again. Apparently it was an issue with my bank account and I changed it straight away but I still haven’t been paid 6 days later. I can’t buy food, pay for nursery or baby formula and we’re going to run out today. Unpaid bills are piling up. 

The anxiety from all this is starting to cause physical problems. I’m sleeping 3 hours a night, waking up worrying. My hearts racing on and off. I’m having panic attacks again for the first time in months. My partners now having to take time off from work because it’s affecting my ability to look after our baby. I wish I’d never tried to work again (I’d spent a while unemployed because every time I try to work, my mental health declines but it’s probably the worst work anxiety I’ve ever had). 

I don’t expect anyone to read this but I just needed to write it down. ",anxiety
"Group work anxiety  I’m extremely afraid of writing my parts. I have no confidence in my writing skills and I don’t want to ruin the project. I’m worried if my terrible writing would make other group members get a lower score and they would blame me even though maybe they would just do it without letting me know. I found everyone except me in this group is very intelligent and has many good thoughts. I’m really anxious and stressful about writing the group essay.

I’m also worried if I contribute too little. Every one is responsible for one part but I always feel like my part lacks workload. Then when everyone fills the contribution table I’ll become the one contributes least. I try my best to help others but I’m afraid I can’t change the fact that my part is much easier than others’.

These anxieties really make my life a mess. Idk what to do :(

"Update 11/5/24 I am realizing that going to the psychologist is no longer worth anything, he only repeats to me what I already know, and yes, I feel good in the session because he manages to question my fatalistic thoughts.

But even so, when I return to everyday life it is clear that I have a very sensitive nervous system because at the slightest symptom I am not able to not feel rejection and fear that the symptoms will get worse, especially with the PVCs, I have not felt any for a few days, but as soon as I feel something stomach-related or related to the stomach, diaphragm, lungs, ribs area, unconsciously my fear levels increase causing poor breathing and tension that aggravates the symptoms, whatever I do during the day I try to do it from total calm, but even so I have a certain degree of body self-monitoring and some avoidance (because I know that if I don't realize it, I could be breathing wrong)

I know that you can be completely free of this and the symptoms disappear and I gain a strength and confidence that even surprises me, but that is the problem ""I know"" but another thing is to feel it because this is ultimately an emotional problem not rational.

Distraction is a key ally, but you can subconsciously link certain daily tasks to this whole picture of worry. I think that is the most difficult thing: ""disconnecting anxious thoughts from tasks that have been tainted by a crisis or an anxious habit.""

As some videos suggest, the dog that is scared while playing the sound links the sound to the scare, then when you play the sound alone the dog gets scared, but the more you play the sound without scaring it, the dog loses sensitivity to the stimulus.

Exposure therapy, but the temptation is still strong, I am still terrified of certain symptoms of anxiety...",anxiety
"Social anxiety and school  Ever since a petty fight I had with people that I thought were my friends in 7th grade, I’ve developed a fear of people and going to school. Always calculating and replying interactions I’ve had with people, trying to be perfect and never needing anything at all times to keep away from other’s judgement and just feel loved and have friends again, but as the years have gone by, I’ve grown more scared of slipping up because my tactics were not working (now that I think about it they never did), people still didn’t like me and I didn’t know why. I became isolated jumped from friend groups to friend groups following them like a puppy and still made no progress. I gave up and spent the rest of highschool alone which made me an awkward person. Talking to people made me feel unsafe in an environment I didn’t feel safe either (I was also very depressed). My heart would start racing and I would sometimes shake when I had to partner up with someone or had oral presentations (I would cry the night before and not be able to sleep). I would skip school everytime I felt overwhelmed and it carried on to college. I’m in my third year and nothing is going right, I got fired wrongfully, my basement flooded so I lost my room which was my only safe space, failing all my classes, struggling to leave my house because I’m anxious 24/7 and not leaving my house makes me more anxious but I genuinely cannot do anything about it. Even tho I’m not in highschool anymore my fear of school is somewhat stronger now? I want to take the next semester off to just focus on myself and work to take some control but my parents don’t play about school and I know I’m going to get bullied for the choice I want to make, but I’ve failed so many classes that I’m literally going to get kicked out next semester anyways.

"TW i’m feeling so defeated by my anxiety. i’m 25yo i’ve been dealing with anxiety since i was around 15. it used to be terrible with panic attacks but i’ve managed it a bit better throughout the years. and recently now its so intense i’m really struggling. i’m feeling so suicidal, i never would do it as i’m my moms only living child life. but i’ve been having the thoughts constantly for the past month. i love my life and i’ve tried to be optimistic but my anxiety is becoming unbearable. i’m in pain basically everyday physically and mentally. i’m so tense and i clench my jaw everyday. i’m struggling to sleep when im shaking my foot and heart feels like it’s beating through my chest. my back muscles are so tense i struggle to sleep even when im laying flat trying to relax. 

i’m on lexapro but im calling tomorrow to talk to a doctor and try to get back into therapy.  i’m gonna take the steps to try and to manage this. 
but its exhausting just knowing everyday i have to wake up and actively do something to not feel the self hatred that comes with my anxiety 
i’m a really social person typically and it’s getting to the point i don’t want to see anyone ever again. 
i feel like everyone hates me, everything i say is stupid and i’m just this terrible person. 
i feel like a burden to anyone i try to even open up to about it, it seems no one understands that i can’t just turn off these thoughts so easily 
some days i just feel like it would be easier to not be here then to continue to try and manage this for the rest of my life. im just sad i feel like im a crazy person

"Vitamin B induced anxiety/ panic attack/late reaction. Had 2 crazy experiences with high doses of vitamin B complex and doctors keep saying it’s just anxiety.
To start up I never had any history of panic attack/mental illnesses and generally have an unconcerned personality.

First weird episode: my blood pressure is elevated (160/100) after using vitamin b (250mg B1 /250mg B6 /1mgb12 cyanocobalamin) also weird feeling, heart palpitations and cannot sleep properly. I felt like I couldn’t breathe in metro and elevator. As my blood pressure was making me feel bad I went to emergency and they said this is a basic panic attack, I was like okay so?, we will give you serum and you will be fine. They administered IV Avil and within 10minutes, my blood pressure spiked up to 230/140, my face is also a bit paralyzed temporarily because of the pressure (i was scared as hell)They barely lower it back with 3 sublingual blood pressure pills to 160/100again.. after this episode i couldnt sleep for next 5 days. Not even 10 minutes. and kept having sudden blood pressure spike again up to 230/140. Meantime I was still taking that b vitamin tablets. Even the blood pressure medications were not working to lower it and doctors suspected adrenal tumor. To do further tests they said cut your vitamin b supplement. And guess what.. my symptoms subsided.. of course nothing positive come from the tests either. Blood pressure back normal to 135/85 too..

Second weird episode: after 3 months of the first episode, i was still having b12 deficiency and slight anemia. Doctors said having a shot of vitamin b complex would be easier and more tolerable.  Norogrizovim I.M. (100mg B1 /100mg B6 /1mg b12 hydroxocobolamin) is administered. After 5 minutes of the shot, my whole body had a burning sensation, like burning coals and pins were touching internally to my body, my eyes my head my hands all over of my body was aching burning and pain with blood pressure spiked to 230/130 again. They said you are fine,this is a panic attack go home and rest. I went outside walked around 1-2 hours and repeating myself this is anxiety and will be over soon.. however my symptoms become worse.. I was barely breathing and become pale and freeze cold. I went to emergency again and they said you are having a late reaction to the shot and administered a shot of Avil/Decort. My symptoms gone away in seconds..also blood pressure lowered to its usual value. Emergency doctor also told me to be careful with vitamin B complexes when I use it next time.

Now I am still deficient of b12 and folic acid and planning a pregnancy. And I have to try supplements again. Doctors keep insisting using the high doses again… have you ever experienced such side effect? Maybe I should try low dose supplements? I suspect that my body cannot tolerate the synthetic and high dose forms of vitamin b as I never had such issue before when i was using basic multi vitamin complexes. However,doctors keeps saying high dose of vitamin b will not cause any side effects or any negative effects at all and these all related to mental health (which were fairly peaceful before those 2 reactions..)

"Anxiety disorder and medical procedures Hello everybody that is taking the time to read this ***(sorry if it's very poorly written)***, I'm currently going through a ridiculously long process with my GP and gastrointestinal doctor, they have pretty much reached the conclusion that i most likely have some form of IBS and IBD after doing two stool lab tests, the whole thing is that they tried forcing me into a coloscopy in just a two week period and I told them that it was way too short of a notice to get something like that done, they know about my anxiety and hypochondria and understood that i sometimes just need a bit of time to fully prepare myself for this, It's now been over 2 months of constant visits to the gp ***(That he forced me to do)*** and just talking about my symptoms and how i felt, I told them that i was finally comfortable with going through with the coloscopy but only wanted to request that i could do it fully awake without an IV ***(Just knowing that there is a needle near me can give me a panic attack)*** and only because of this request they've decided to delay it even more and now I'm just lost, they're making it a hell for me, refusing to give alternative options and now i'm just stuck here with pain and uncertainty of what it could be. and i understand that it's partially my fault because the anxiety got so bad that I've convinced myself that it could've been cancer ***(and that was highly unlikely as they told me that)*** that i just couldn't do it, but aren't doctors supposed to make the procedure as comfortable for the patient as possible? I've had friends who also suffer from IBD who had the coloscopy without an IV and now they are refusing to do it for me.... like what the hell...

"Anxiety causing low libido but fear of SSRI causing ED or further loss of libido. Catch 22 Bit of a catch 22 situation here i feel. I am a 45 year old male who's suffered with anxiety for most of my life. A lot seems to be around my health. Racing thoughts which then lead me to bouts of depression. Not wanting to wake up on a morning with that feeling of doom. I now seem to have had a big dip in my sex drive and im currently in a bout of anxiety / depression so i'm assuming this is the cause. I have had me hormones tested and all are fine so its not physiological. 

I was on sertraline for a while but i found that sometimes it took me a while to climax. However, i'm sure i didn't have any libido issues or ED when on this med. I did feel a lot better when on sertraline and the increase in time to climax isn't always a negative. However, i did change to Mirtazapine as i started a new relationship and i was worried that the length of time it was taking me to climax may have made my new partner concerned. I then decided to take a medication break which was around 6 months ago. 

In those 6 months i have had a few life situations and i feel my anxiety / depression as slowly started to return and then out of no where my sex drive as dropped. I still think about sex just haven't got the same horniness like i did have last year. 

I do feel like its my anxiety that's causing the libido dip but then i'm afraid going back on SSRI may cause a bigger dip or even ED. ",anxiety

"My experience with health anxiety, and why I can promise that you are almost certainly okay. !Trigger warning: discussion of health anxiety, medical tests, detailed description of symptoms, and mentions of specific illnesses!

Tl;dr at the bottom for those short on time/patience.

Hello everyone,

Unfortunately, if you are reading this, you are probably familiar with the cost that stress and anxiety can exact on your body- you might even be experiencing the effects right now. This post is not the first of its kind, and it certainly won't be the last, but I'm hoping that my words can soothe someone out there.

I F18, began experiencing a swath of disturbing neurological symptoms around 3 years ago. I still remember the day when I first felt ""off."" I had been through a particularly stressful day, when all of the sudden, I had the mental feeling of being struck by lightning, and the next minute my hands and calves were very finely shaking. It was worrying, but I ignored it and figured that I would wake up tomorrow and it would be gone.

Predictably, I woke up the next day, and it was not gone- nope, it had instead spread to seemingly every limb in my body except for my head. Over the next months and years, I would slowly gain a new symptom, and lose another. This would continue in cycles that I (blindly) couldn't associate with the (now obvious) rises in stress I experienced at times. Looking back, I'm surprised that I was able to keep my shit together while feeling like I was literally falling apart at the seams, but amazingly, I didn't visit a doctor about my symptoms until just this April when I ended up in the ER. 

The event that sent me there was a terrifying one. I had woken up around 3am to stabbing pain and glanced down to see my right hand uncontrollably and painfully curling itself into my arm. I tried to pry open my fingers and straighten my wrist, but all I could feel was the resistance of the muscles in my palm and tendons. Of course, that sent me into a full-blown panic attack. My only thought was ""Oh god, I waited too long, and now I've just lost use of my arm forever."" After about 40 minutes, my hand relaxed into a slightly more normal position and I managed to fall back asleep, but the first thing I did the next morning was take myself to the hospital because I was still fully convinced I was dying...or at least in the process of losing control of my limbs. The ER doctors were surprisingly accommodating. I think the sheer timespan of my symptoms caused them to take me seriously. By the end of the day, I had gotten an ekg, extensive labs, an ultrasound of my adrenal glands and thyroid, a basic neurological workover, an IV, and most importantly: a CT scan of my brain- which, shockingly, showed absolutely no abnormalities. I left the hospital slightly relieved and with a referral to a proper neurologist, but I still felt my anxiety screaming at me that they had simply missed the real and probably chronic cause of all of my problems.

A month later I made it to my neurology appointment, and told the doctor everything. At that time, my daily symptoms consisted of, but were not limited to: whole body tremors during \*any\* movement, aphantasia (phantom pressure, tingles, etc) in my chest and back, loss of balance, altered gait, perceived weakness in my right arm, flashes of color and sensitivity to light in both of my eyes, hours-long episodes of shortness of breath, restless legs, hypnic jerks, and severe & painful cramping attacks. My visit ended in an order for a contrast MRI of my brain and spine. I was 100% sure at this point that I had MS and that one of the MRIs would reveal the lesion that had been eating away at my body, proving that my anxiety had been right all along. I anxiously waited through the weekend for my results, and when they came I was blown away, I had......

...nothing. In fact, in a follow-up exam, my neurologist scrolled through the model of my brain just to point out how standard it was.

Fast forward to the present, and practically all of my symptoms are gone. I still experience a slight tremble in my fingers every now and then, and if I'm going through a heavy period of stress, I notice that some of my symptoms reappear. But, therapy has revealed to me that my anxiety and extensive traumas affect me in more ways than I realize. And that, through no fault of my own, my brain had decided to express overwhelming emotions in a physical manner. The most I can do is show up for annual doctor's visits, eat a healthy diet, exercise, and take medication if I need to. 

I just wanted to share my story with you guys' because this sub is one of the many that I scrolled through for hours when I was at my worst. I know how haunting anxiety can be, and how hopeless physical symptoms can make daily life feel. If you are going through something similar to what I described, I encourage you discuss it with a doctor, so that you can have a concrete answer. If, for some reason, you can't do that or already have to no avail, just know that YES, anxiety, stress, & trauma can cause absolutely insane symptoms. You can 100% make it through this, guys.

Wishing everyone here peace and strength,

DM me or drop me a comment if you have any questions or need a little more comfort.

Tl;dr: Had a sudden onset of constant, horrendous, unexplained neurological symptoms. They got worse for years, until I got a ton of tests which showed that I was, in fact, physically fine. Anxiety, stress, trauma, mental health in general can cause \*real\* symptoms in an otherwise perfectly healthy person. Love yourself, and know that your symptoms are 99.9999999% likely not a sign of some rare or fatal disease.

"My ongoing battle with health anxiety. Any tips?  Hello everyone ! :) 

As the title says, I battle with health anxiety. This began back in 2020 when I was infected with strep throat and months later a stomach flu. Of course COVID hit after.

To this day, anytime I feel something going on with me I tend to think the WORST. I tell myself “What if I’m badly sick?” Or “What if I don’t get this checked out soon” and basically fill my head with tons of what if questions that ultimately lead up to me possibly dying. 

Yes, I do the drastic “Googling” agenda I know I shouldn’t be doing but it’s kinda instinct at this point unfortunately. 

While I go to the gym and do my damn best to eat well and take care of myself, I’m always prone to something. I deal with allergies and while my asthma is much better, I still have it as it’s a chronic thing I’ll have forever lol. 

I was also told I have a fused heart valve which, as of now, it’s okay but eventually at age 30 I’ll have to get it checked out just to make sure I’m okay. 

My point isn’t to have sympathy for me as I’m sure many many other people may struggle with far worst but… I’m tired of always crying and thinking something is going on with me. I want to break free of this pain. 

Any tips or advice to deal with health anxiety would be greatly appreciated :) thank you",anxiety
Well another one of those nights …  Looking for a new approach .. tell me how much of a pussy I am and that everything is just in my head and I need to get over it?? ,anxiety
"Scared to death At my lowest point I was getting panic attacks 5 to 10 times a day. Even then I didn't need to use Ativan very often. They would last about 2 to 10 mins. I would use cold water or air to help soothe me. After almost a year of therapy, my panic attacks were becoming way less frequent. I ended up coming off my lexapro after being on it for a long time. I was doing well with therapy plus it didn't really work well to help my anxiety.

3 months after stopping, I started to get really bad anxiety and panic attacks. Doctor prescribed be a popular med that helps with anxiety. Well I had the worst side effects from it. I had the biggest panic attack lasting 8 hours, I was shaking uncontrollably, throwing up, completely disoriented. It was the worst feeling of my life. I stopped taking it immediately. I felt like myself again less than 24 hours later. I was still anxious but I didn't feel like I was on a bad trip anymore.

Well, a few days after quitting the new med, the attacks started up, they are so severe that I was put on benzos. I take the quick dissolving tablet but still my attack doesn't really start to go away until about 2 hours after taking it. As soon as the benzos wear off another attack comes on. I can't even call it a panic attack. It is literally uncontrollable, I don't know what is triggering it and all my coping skills I've learned over the years in therapy do nothing to ease it. I've tested my blood pressure during these attacks and they are about 152/105. My normal rate is 121/79. 

I am at a loss of what to do. I can't rely on benzos forever. I see my doctor on Wednesday. I started lexapro again this week. 10 mg and I am thinking of maybe asking for a beta blocker?

I'm having a hard time eating, I've lost 5 lbs in the last week and my weight keeps going down.

"Is it Anxiety or a Panic Attack?  First, a little background on my panic attacks. When I drive on a small, 2-lane, country road, and someone drives behind me, I begin to hyperventilate until I almost pass out. I've had these panic attacks since I was on my early 20s. I feel trapped. 

Fast forward to two years ago. I got breast cancer and had a double mastectomy. The year before that, my mom died, I lost my job, and my son went to prison for a year. I also deal with a mean sister. Ever since all of that, I have a new type of anxiety (or panic) attack. Numbness starts in my belly and works its way up to my head and shoulders. I get a feeling of sheer terror, as if I am about to die or be killed. Has anyone experienced this type of attack? I get them several times a week. I am prescribed Zoloft and Xanax but I still suffer. Any advice?",anxiety

"help i've been trying to fall asleep for the past 45 mins with guided meditations in the background and my mind keeps straying to overthinking things...

- most of my family is travelling until the end of the month in another country, leaving me home to take care of everything. i work from home, so it should be easy, but i can't help but feel overwhelmed 
- in february, i suffered from something called bppv (when your ear crystals decide to give you vertigo), and i dealt residual dizziness up until early summer when i finished seeing a vestibular therapist to deal with my slight balance issues. i basically had random moments every day where it felt like i was on a boat, but seeing the vestibular therapist helped a ton
- with all of that, im petrified that it'll come back this month while everyone is away - studies say there's a chance of it reoccurring within the same year), and i wont have any help or support around me to keep up with managing the house or taking care of my pet
- i feel slight dizziness when im more tired, and with trying to balance everything, ive been getting tired earlier, and i think that's what's also causing my anxiety spike today
- maybe also because i took my first supplement of magnesium today after dinner and im overthinking it
- maybe im also overthinking the fact that i made rice in the ricecooker for lunch today and left it closed in there for around 7-8 hours until i had some again for dinner (i unplugged it after lunch) and im scared i gave myself food poisoning lol - i nuked it in the microwave twice, because where i am now is pretty cold
- my anxiety's overall been pretty manageable this year, but as i've been laying in bed trying to go to sleep early and calm down, i think my brain is tricking me into thinking im dizzy when im not, and its making me think the worst (something will happen when nobody's here)
- i have friends that i can call, and even one that lives 2 minutes away by drive, but i hate burdening people with my problems

help a person stop overthinking over here so i can get some much needed rest lol ",anxiety

"Question about SSRI Question about SSRI

Hi guys, I need your help with something since maybe one of you has more experience than me in this. I have been taking SSRI for a month because of my OCD and this is helping me a lot and I am feeling like I was before. I am a young man. The only thing is that when having sex I don't feel as much, the sensations are not the same and it takes me a long time to be able to have an orgasm. Well, I have this fear, it's a little irrational. Sometimes I feel like I don't feel anything like numb, does the other person feel that way? I mean, can I transmit these emotions to the other person? Or does the other person feel normal?

"I'm afraid  Hey , so I think I'm having a panic attack but I'm scared its something worse . So today I was really sick, I have a flu but I still decided to go to the gym . After doing some cardio I was really out of breath and it hurt . Like I've never felt this bad when out of breath. Then when the class ended l had a muffled hearing so I panicked . But I tried to tell myself its just because I'm sick.  Then I went home . My chest started to hurt on the right and I thought i was having like a cardiac arrest because my dads doctor told him that sometimes the pain can be felt in the right side because it travels . Then my left arm hurt . And now it's still hurting and I feel really bad . I always feel like dying when having a panic attack but every time I think this is it . Especially when new symptoms appear like right chest pain and muffled hearing . I'm used to the left pain and chest hurt . My back is also hurting me which isn't helping. And Iike I cant even go to the hospital to check because everyone is asleep and I can't drive and I don't want to wake them up if it's just a panic attack.  I'm also scared of sleeping right now.

"Highly sensitive  My entire life I’ve extremely sensitive, crying at the smallest things, able to sense a change in tone in someone’s voice, knowing when someone doesn’t like me, etc. 

I’ve been doing well for a while now but today couldn’t have been worse. My friend was late meeting me (like usual), my other friend asked me for money that I had honestly forgotten to send him, and now my other friend I’m living with just asked me nicely to talk quieter on the phone because it’s late (which I didn’t realize I was being loud because I’ve got my headphones on). 

None of these are things to cry over but I’ve feel it building up all day and now I haven’t been able to stop sobbing over the last hour. 

My life has been perfect the last few months, nothing to be upset over so I just don’t understand why I get like this out of the blue. 

I haven’t been diagnosed with anxiety but I was diagnosed with depression (at age 13 but 22F now) and have always felt like I most likely do have anxiety. I can remember since I was as young as five, never quite feeling things the same way other people did, crying over everything small or big and it’s been a struggle. 

I just want to a stop feeling this way and tried to tell my parents but they all but ignored me. I don’t know what to do. ",anxiety
"Terrified of having ALS (Left leg feels weak and achy) .  Maybe PTSD relapse? Hello everyone, I, 22(F), have been absolutely terrified of the idea of having ALS. For context I have been recently diagnosed with PTSD  after a terrible cruise vacation which had me spiral into a constant panic state and unfortunately I did suffer a concussion a little over a month ago (which makes me worried that it might have ""offset"" ALS) this is more of a paranoia than based on evidence btw.

These symptoms started last month. I have been recovering from a PTSD episode since August, I got my concussion in September and then early October is where I am spiraling til now. So in October my PCP in my crappy neighborhood clinic told me that I probably have an autoimmune disease despite me being tested for it 4 years ago and never having any symptoms for it (even now). I tested negative twice. Keep in. mind this is the same place that told me I probably have schizophrenia because I had an auditory hallucination when I was falling asleep (which, btw is a very common and normal thing). Even though I know I more than likely was fine I still had another breakdown and started to get anxious all over again.

The incident: Few days after phone call scare

I was starting to feel better about my health even though I had barely eaten and stayed in my room most of the time and decided I needed to get some food so I finally left my room and walked quite a bit to get to the store. While in line my leg randomly stopped working for a few seconds, I initially felt like my left foot was on top of some napkins that I wanted to move away but I couldn't move my leg!  Of course I was terrified and nearly had a panic attack and went to the ER who told me I was fine. However since the incident I have been getting a variety of symtpms but the most concerning one is that the leg that stopped working for a few seconds feel weak, stiff, and achy on the kneecap. I was already starting to feel stuff leading up to the big event but nothing too concerning and I think it was more of a result as me being panicky about what the PCP told me.

It's been almost a month now and I have been getting a variety of symptoms. Some have migrated to other parts of my body such as sporadic burning, muscle twitches, dizziness, and of course weakness in or the ""off feeling"" in my left leg. I've done 2 neuro tests and my neuromuscular specialist doesn't suspect MS but if the blood and MRI don't catch anything we will proceed with an EMG. I am just trying to take it day by day. My comforts are that although I am experiencing more things a lot of symptoms seem to fluctuate or have gone away such as twitching and burning so I am willing to chalk those up to anxiety. However I am worried about my leg. I wonder if it's because something different cause my leg to stop working and now I'm hyperfixated on my leg or if it is something more sinister. I also heard some people say that they had anxiety that made them ""stuck"" before but I wasn't panicking the day it happened.

Anxiety can do some crazy stuff. Let me know what you all think. I feel like I can't be the only one here.  I'll update with what happens!",anxiety

"Antipsychotic medication for anxiety? Is my psych mad??? So i’ve been battling with anxiety for close to a decade now, i’m 24m and i’ve been going to psychoanalytical psychotherapy for half a year, but recently my anxiety has been so wild that i can no longer function. The psychological effects such as social anxiety, hypochondria, fear of confrontation and so on i can live with, but the physical ones completely shut me down. Shortness of breath, stinging in the chest, stinging daily headaches for weeks on end, brain fog have completely defeated me and i can no longer even focus at work. I consulted my psychotherapist and she said that it’s fine to get anxiety meds to function. Now the things is i went to a psychiatrist and she perscribed me 1mg flupentixol. Being the hypochondriac that i am - i quickly googled and found out that antipsychotics, especially typical ones(like flupentixol) have a tendency to cause tardive dyskinesia, which is a sometimes irreversible life changing parkinson like tremor/tick disease and they also reduce grey and white matter of the brain. The actual fuck? Does anyone have experience with this approach/substance? Why not low dose benzodiazepines like xanax or beta-blockers like propranolol which don’t have permanent debilitating risk factors? Can someone please fill me in with your own experiences. Thanks in advance 🙏

EDIT: thank you all for your replies, they’ve been really helpful. My final decision will be to never in my life to even consider antipsychotics, i have history of parkinsons in my family and involuntary ticks as is(e.g. my neck tenses up and pulls my mouth down from intrusive anxious thoughts and that’s just one example), so it would be impossible to recognise TD symptoms and that is a gamble i’d never be willing to take. I will explore different options with my psychiatrist. ",anxiety
Overthinking and anxiety  I’m F 20 and I have been through a lot in the past 2 and half almost three years both of my grandparents passed within a year of each other and I had to grow up quickly tbh.

It's not the most awful thing I've ever been in work-wise, but I really just want to run away and not deal with it. I've been having panic attacks since then. Not being able to eat, relax, keep my mind off of it, etc. But it's like every time I want to open up a Word doc and write up a resignation, I also have this voice that says ""you can get through this"".

I got a degree (which is useless so doesn't even matter) I worked throughout college, but all my life has ever been and will ever be is this fucking pit in my stomach, anxiety filled nightmare.

No matter what. It literally does not matter. I live with this fucking feeling every second of every day. I've been to more therapists than I can count, been on as many medications as I was allowed to be, and it's done nothing, absolutely nothing. Even if I COULD live life that way, WHY would I???? Doing this for the rest of my life??? That sounds like actual Hell. For the rest of my life, I will just worry about being fired/homeless/hated at my job, etc especially because all my past jobs have all been everyone hating me and I have no idea why or how to fix it and everyone says that doesn't matter but I'd say it does since it makes the difference between a roof over your head or not.

"Every physical symptom under the sun is getting to me. I’m so tired.  I haven’t gotten out of bed today. I can’t help but think it’s not anxiety because literally everything is wrong and something new starts every single day. My stomach hurts, my not-stomach abdomen hurts, I’m nauseous, there’s a nauseous lump in my throat, my chest hurts all over the place, I get periods of feeling like I can’t breathe, im exhausted, my heart rate is through the roof, ive had random bouts of numbness on one side of my body, hot flashes, cold flashes, light sensitivity, today I had my elementary school classic sign of having to pee every 30 minutes, I can’t sleep, im never hungry but when I eat I get nauseous, I see spots, my vision is getting worse, im so dizzy. so dizzy. all the time. sitting down, standing up, walking around, drinking water, drinking Gatorade, nothing helps. There has to be something in my head or my heart or my lungs and I can’t stop looking shit up even though I know it’s making things worse because I spiral more otherwise in the moment. my heart has been cleared by a cardiologist and I’ve had a stomach ultrasound and I’ve had about a dozen blood tests taken and everything is normal. half a dozen doctors and urgent care visits, two days at the ER. im downing zofran and ginger candy like my life depends on it and I’ve gone through like ten packs of gum or something and those are the only things that have helped even a little bit. The other medicines I’ve tried have made me nauseous just like everything else. The constant gum chewing is starting to make my jaw hurt and cause additional headaches but I can’t stop doing it because it’s the only thing that keeps the throat nausea down.

i was diagnosed with anxiety in elementary school and have been taking medicine for it my whole life but it’s never failed on me like this. I’ve never felt like this. I might have to withdraw from my classes for the rest of the semester because I’ve been MIA for a month and we have a really strict attendance policy and my professors’ kindness can only stretch so far before they can’t do any more for me. im trying to keep up from home but it’s just not the same, I know I’m supposed to be failing every one of my classes and I swear I’m just kidding myself trying to pretend I can save my grade like this. But I don’t want to drop everything. I want to go back to my activities and groups because I’m leaving them to deal with my absence and asking for just one more week because it’ll definitely get better, it’ll surely get better. but it doesn’t. i just learned after writing like two more paragraphs that I missed my class registration day today. fuck.

for the irl physical activity I’m out of shape, and last time I practiced with them I started seeing spots and couldn’t keep up out of nowhere even though I’ve been part of this group for 3 years. I don’t want to have to leave this group. We have a deadline for what we’re working on and I’m barely still there because of multiple freak outs I had on them over the years. But the longer I beg for more time the more guilty I feel. I think that’s when this all started, at the end of the summer when all the sudden I was dizzy and nauseous all the time and couldnt walk anywhere without my heart rate spiking and couldn’t dance with them but everything is fine apparently. it’s just gotten worse but everything always comes back normal. I have an expensive ass ticket to go to a concert in a week and a half to see a Japanese artist that I don’t even know why they’re in such a small venue by me but if I miss that on top of everything else because I can’t even stand up for more than two minutes my whole world will be crushed man idk. 

the other two things are gaming because that’s all I love to do and feel like doing most of the time but lately I haven’t been able to play anything for more than an hour or so because I get nauseous or my head starts to hurt and I know I’m just fucking washed now in my competitive game I feel like my team won’t need me anymore or I’m rude for trying to pop back up at the end of our season when I’ve been missing for weeks and weeks and not playing or practicing because I don’t feel like it and I just can’t. Im scared I’m going to show up to my mmo raid  group tomorrow and not be able to make it through 3 hours with people Ive gotten to know, doing something I know how to do, because I’ve already called it quits early twice because “my tummy hurts” and god I feel like hot garbage every time I do it. Or maybe I just won’t be able to show up at all.

I’m scared to take a shower because it makes me dizzy and nauseous. I’m scared to eat because it makes me nauseous. All I want to do is sleep but I’m scared to sleep, because I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night every night for the past like two weeks straight into a panic attack. I took a full dose of sleep aid and I still woke up through it in the middle of the night. i had a dream last night where I started to vomit and that’s literally the thing im scared of most in the world. I’m scared to sleep because I don’t wanna wake up but not like in a sh kind of way. 

I don’t know what symptoms are from anxiety and what’s from sleep deprivation or what’s from something else and I can’t even ask anyone because it’s been so impossible to get an appointment with anyone. I saw a new psychiatrist and she’s really nice but the medicine changes aren’t drastic or fast enough and the place im supposed to start setting up therapy with is just completely MIA it’s starting to feel hopeless. 

I just feel bad for being so whiny and frustrating and making the same complaints in circles around and around and around, I can tell it’s driving my mom insane and I feel bad because she’s got so much on her plate right now and it makes my dad lose sleep when I wake up having a panic attack I can’t calm down from. I fear I’m driving one of my closest online friends away atm because he’s basically been my therapist in place of a real one because he’s the only person that’s seemed to listen and respond even though he says it’s fine I just can’t shake that feeling.

There’s probably more but. idk. everything sucks right now. sorry for the essay. I just needed to put it all down and put it somewhere. 

And just to be clear, I wouldn’t nor do I plan to harm myself or others. Frankly I’m too much of a wimp to ever do anything and I know there are many people in my life that care about me and would be sad if anything happened. But I feel like I’m really nearing my limit and am kind of scared that one day my body is just gonna give up cause it really feels like it sometimes.

"Heart palpations making life impossible  I get these things called premature atrial contractions that my doctor says is caused by anxiety. They started in my late 20s and caused me to become a hypochondriac for a bit until we got it figured out. I was on anti anxiety meds and they went away up until a few years ago.

I don’t feel them when I’m walking or moving, but laying down or sitting in the couch in the evening, my heart feels like it’s pumping out of my throat.

My therapist today said something about using exposure response so that I learn to ignore them. Which is what I had done in the past but I can also note that it was because I kept myself occupied with other hobbies. But things haven’t been going well in my primary relationship and so i try to spend more time with them but I start getting them the minute I sit down.

It’s happening in bed, too, and I just am at a loss. I don’t know if it’s because I feel so much pressure or anxiety with my spouse but I also don’t know how to change all of this other than doing what I’ve been doing which is getting up when it becomes too much and working around the house or calling a friend.

I’m really worried and I can’t tell if my lack of concentration is from the headache or my anxiety. I’m terrified of salt poisoning and worried my brain could swell or my arteries could clog, or a stroke. I’m 16 but I know it’s very possible. Please, any advice?",anxiety

"Panic attack meltdown relief help I have been extremely stressed, depressed, and having panic attacks for the last six months. I am not going to go into details but it’s to the point where the smallest disruptions cause me into a meltdown. I have hit my breaking point and went to see a doctor today after waiting a couple weeks. They prescribed me two medications, Abilify and Cymbalta. Abilify is $500+ without insurance at my pharmacy. I am currently unemployed due to my mental health. I now have to wait for them to transfer it to a different pharmacy where I can use goodRX so it is affordable. 

So of course when I got back to my car I had a full blown melt down. You know how hard it is getting ahold of your doctor and I am feeling hopeless this is going to be resolved soon. I just so desperately need relief.

I need something to help me in this moment. I’m just coming down after that meltdown. Is there something over the counter or something I can do to help calm me during this time. I am on the verge of 5150’ing myself, but I cannot afford that right now and the stress of being in medical debt (which I already am) will put me into another tailspin. ",anxiety
"Self sabotaging thoughts  About a month ago I had some life stressors going on and my anxiety was really heightened. I have suffered anxiety on and off my entire life. I’m a 29 y/o female. I am self employed as a licensed esthetician I do lashes and makeup. This is wedding season and I travel to do makeup for wedding parties that vary in size from 4-8 people. I usually LOVE my weddings. (Amazing money, getting out of the house, making people feel beautiful, leaving there feeling like a boss ass bitch.) anyway, around the time my anxiety was first getting somewhat heightened I had a HUGE wedding. It was a party of 12 so I got an assistant which I’ve never done before. Well it ended up triggering me big time. When my assistant arrived I felt out of control of the situation and had a panic attack that I tried to conceal. I was so worried I couldn’t pull it together. So much pressure for me to do 8 people I had her do 4 and I was shaky. I ended up making it through the wedding but it was horrible to think if I had not pushed through what would have happened. I have worked so hard to build a good reputation and be where I am today and I would struggle knowing I messed up someone’s wedding day. Well ever since that experience it is really weighing on me. I had 2 weddings after that they were pretty small I had a lot of anxiety before starting but was fine once I did. I have a party of 7 this Saturday and just keep having anxiety about it even though I’m perfectly capable. What is wrong with me and how can I get out of my head? I’ve done so many weddings and they have all done amazing up until this point. I don’t want to avoid future bookings because of this. I make a lot of extra money from them and I always loved doing them. I can’t stop worrying that I will have anxiety or a panic attack while working. If I’m shaky I can’t do good work.

"Chest pain that comes and goes 

Ever since September, I (23M) have had these dull, aching chest pains (very mild, but bothersome) that are intermittent, it happens every day. They occur on the left side of my chest, right where my heart is. Sometimes it will switch to the right side but that is rare, and it has not moved to the arms or any other extremities. The chest pains themselves have sparked a few panic attacks, which I have never had before despite being diagnosed with Anxiety at a young age. 

I have taken two trips to Urgent Care with no abnormalities on EKG tests each visit. I also had a visit with my Dr. who also took an EKG and found nothing wrong. I also had bloodwork and urine taken, but nothing abnormal was found. 

It happens when I work (I work physical labor in a warehouse) and also when I rest, there is no real difference in timing. There is no pain when I press the affected area. The symptoms have not gotten worse nor better, and I have not had any other symptoms other than chest pain/discomfort. 

I have chalked it up to Anxiety or Angina. Anxiety makes sense because I have panic attacks conveniently around the same time this chest pain has started. I also don’t wake up with chest pain, and it doesn’t interfere with my sleep. But it feels just like Angina according to the internet, however I am very young and I would say I have a decent diet, although Hypertension could be a factor of my anxiety. I ingest THC to help with Anxiety a few times a week usually, I drink alcohol on special occasions. 

I still don’t have clear answers after all these visits and it worries me. It really sucks living like this not knowing what it could be. Thank you for reading in advance.

"Things that help me🩷 I’ve had a really tough week with anxiety so have refreshed my tool box. Thought I would share what’s helped and hopefully it helps one of you too :) 

- weighted blanket! This helps me get such a better night’s sleep and comforts me during the day. 

- hot water bottle on my tummy. This just really comforts me and helps relax my stomach that gets quite tense when I’m anxious / feeling poorly. 

- ASMR. Some people hate it but I find it SO relaxing. I particularly love watching “ASMR massage” or “ASMR facial”. It sends me straight to sleep. 

- Disordered podcast by Drew Linsalata and Joshua Fletcher. The make me feel so seen. 

- Paint by numbers. Super relaxing and really lets my mind shut off. 

- Progressive Muscle Relaxation. This has really helped with muscle aches and learning how to unclench tight muscles. 

- Reading. I’m a huge reader and full time book editor so my favourite thing ever is falling into a fictional world. 

- practicing compassion. To do this I close my eyes and imagine myself feeling the way I feel (anxious) and then imagine non anxious me entering the scene and looking after her. It usually ends up being child me (anxious) being looked after by adult me. Very healing. 

- Cold flannel on the back of my neck and head. Really helps calm my nervous system.

"Does anyone have hidden underlying anxiety that causes health issues? The titles says it how it is I suppose. 

The summer before college I noticed a lot of health issues. Primarily with GI tract. I would wake up in the middle of the night feeling like I had to vomit, had terrible acid reflux, and some other general GI issues. I went to the GI doctor and they immediately told me it was my anxiety causing these issues. Sure enough, once I got settled into college, they disappeared. They come back when I’m anxious about things, so it makes sense to me how. 

The weird thing was I didn’t feel actively anxious about starting college. It was kinda subliminal in a way I suppose. Just looming. 

I’m wondering if that “looming” anxiety is enough to cause health issues for people. I’m currently in a multi-month long situation which could cause looming anxiety, and I have took on more (different) GI issues that I can not solve. I’m starting to wonder if it is just looming anxiety. 

I also have trichotillmania. I often find myself pulling my hair out without realizing it. Subliminal i suppose. I wonder if my digestive issues are the same.

"5 hour driving trip for the first time  Work trip coming up 

I have anxiety about everything but like on and off driving anxiety I guess? I have moments were I love driving but when I’m thinking about it or planning out a trip that involves driving I start imagining the worst.

I have a work trip coming up and I’ve been anxious about it for months, flipping back and forth between wanting to take the bus there or drive. It’s a 5-6 hour trip by car and with the bus it would be about 8 hours. Both options make me anxious 🙃 

I could have just not gone, this trip is voluntary, but I’m trying to be more “adventurous”, to get out of my comfort zone, and to own my decisions since I’ve already committed.

I imagine for most people this is so not a big deal, so I’m trying to tell myself that and to follow what a non anxious person would do.
It’s a few days away and I’m up late again stressing.

"Please help Let me start off by saying I am a 24yr old female who has been dealing with health anxiety and severe panic attacks for around two years now. A little over a month ago I woke up with a high heart rate, as well as tightness in my chest and pain in my left arm. I took a trip to the ER where they did bloodwork, EKG, chest x-rays, and a ct scan of lungs to check for pulmonary embolism. Every test came back normal. I have had a high heart rate for a long time now, which I have always been told is anxiety. I have seen a cardiologist and worn a heart monitor, had an echocardiogram done, and many blood panels which were all normal. Since my first trip to the ER a month ago my symptoms have worsened. I have constant chest pain directly over my heart, pain in my arms, neck and collar bones. My heart constantly races, and I have multiple panic attacks a day about the pains. It’s gotten to the point where I can barely eat or sleep. I constantly think I’m going to die or that something must be seriously wrong that the doctors are missing.

"Illness Anxiety I've been dealing with what I think is illness anxiety for about two years now. Last year, I was away from home for my job. One night after my shift (working from home), I went to sleep around 3 a.m. I had been drinking quite a bit over the previous two days, but I didn’t think that was an issue. However, after just 15 minutes of sleep, I woke up with a racing heart and a locked jaw, thinking I was having a heart attack. I rushed to the ER, convinced I was about to die during that 10-minute ride. By morning, they discharged me, and I felt fine, but then it happened again that evening, and it kept happening for the next three or four days. I decided to return home, as I was already working remotely.

Even during the train journey back, I had another episode, and I had to get off to visit the ER. But just like before, as soon as I arrived, everything felt normal again. Once home, I saw my GP, who prescribed me Klonopin (0.5 mg), propranolol (20 mg), and some multivitamins. The episodes stopped, and I eventually realized I was experiencing panic attacks after learning more about Klonopin’s purpose. However, my doctor never mentioned when to stop taking Klonopin and advised I continue it for at least a year—which I now see was a mistake.

Throughout that year, I experienced other symptoms like crying for no apparent reason, a racing heartbeat, and an inability to exercise because of it. After a year, I stopped all the medications cold turkey, without realizing that withdrawal symptoms could be severe. That’s when I truly experienced the consequences of stopping Klonopin after a year of use.

I had to see a psychiatrist (it’s quite taboo here, so I didn’t tell anyone and consulted one online). They prescribed me Paroxetine, which was honestly terrible, so I stopped. I saw another doctor who prescribed Lexapro (5 mg). After a week, I felt like myself again. All the horrors—depersonalization, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), suicidal thoughts, and impulsive thoughts—faded. After a year, my doctor increased the dose to 20 mg, and I felt better than ever.

But still, the fear of illness hasn’t gone away. I’m anxious about going places alone because of thoughts like, what if I feel the urge to jump off the train or do something impulsive. Recently, I learned about illness anxiety and OCD, and I think I might have OCD centered around suicidal thoughts.

"How do I stop thinking my boyfriend will leave me? (Mention of abuse)
Hi, I(20f) have been with my boyfriend(21m) for a little over 3 months now.  He's absolutely amazing. We have so much in common and really enjoy spending time together. Hes super respectful and kind. I was in a super abusive relationship for 2 years before him so this is my first healthy and happy relationship.

I'm so scared hes going to leave me. I haven't said anything about it to him because I don't want to manifest it, but I keep thinking about it. I love him and I know he loves me back, so why do I keep thinking that he's going to leave me? Its not debilitating, this fear, but it creeps up. Its not as bad as some of my other anxieties but I want to try to catch it before it gets worse. 

I'm afraid. I have alot of phyiscal and mental health issues. I have a herniated disk and degenerative disk disease. I was also just diagnosed with fibromyalgia and I'm getting testing to see if I have arthritis or something like that. I also have AuDHD and pretty bad depression. I also have PTSD from my ex. I'm falling apart and hes still here. I'm always in pain, but he's still here. But what if he doesn't realize that this pain is forever. That it's not going to go away, and he will be stuck with someone who has a defective body?

I feel like I lied to him by not telling him right away about all this. We met on a dating app. He had no idea that I had all these issues. 

We could be having an amazing time, and all of a sudden my brain is like ""enjoy this now, it could end at any moment"". He's not done or said ANYTHING to even suggest he is looking to end it. We get along so well, I have never felt this way towards another person. I thought I loved my ex but that was just codependence. I'm realizing that this is what love is. I feel so safe and warm around him. We often talk about our future plans and how much we value eachother. 

So why am I so afraid? Why can't I trust that everything will be ok because we do love eachother? Why am I so scared that one day hes going to realize that I'm not perfect? Realistically, he already has, and he is still here, kind as ever. So why? Why do I feel so anxious? How do I shut it off and just enjoy his kindness and love?",anxiety
"My life is miserable because of nosocomephobia. Hello, I am an ordinary college student in my 20s living in south Korea.

When I was young, the whole world was an object of curiosity for me. However, strangely enough, I was afraid of hospitals. In such a situation, when I was young, I simply resented my mother for taking me to the hospital. However, since resenting her like this would not solve anything, I thought about my own reasons and came to the conclusion that it is right to go to the hospital only when necessary. Even if a situation arises where I have to go to the hospital (ex: getting cancer), I am afraid of the hospital and cannot go. It is painful to even imagine such a situation. So the only thing I can do is pray that I will never be in that situation. Because of these situations, I sometimes end up committing suicide.

Right now, I feel like I have an inguinal hernia. I haven't been to the hospital yet. But the problem is that I am extremely afraid of going to the hospital, but I also know that I have to go. So I am thinking deeply about suicide right now. Thank you for listening to my long story.",anxiety

"Anxiety triggered by exertion  Hi guys, new to Reddit. Recently been having issues with my anxiety being triggered during exertion. I never used to have this issue, it’s always been different symptoms with my anxiety, so this one’s new.

Anyone got tips for me to help cope better? I am due to walk 20 mins to my local lakes to watch fireworks tomorrow with friends and I wonna be relatively calm to the point that I can at least do this comfortably.

It’ll be dark, busy, loud and I won’t have my car to escape too, so those extra 4 factors will add to the anxiety also.

"My brother's alcoholism may make my family fall apart.  My younger brother has been living with us for about a month now since he had a serious mental health episode and went missing for three days. For several years now he's been living with alcoholism to cope with abuse he experienced from his previous roommate/landlord and bullying he experienced in high school.

Now his drinking at night is causing the rest of us to lose sleep so my mom is having a meeting/intervention with him tonight. I'm very worried that this will make my brother upset and he'll leave home, none of us knowing if/when he'll return.

I feel like a selfish piece of shit for not being a good big brother to my two younger brothers. If I had been more supportive and closer with them, they would more likely be happier now and one of them wouldn't have turned to drinking to deal with trauma.

"What happened? Hi, lately I've been wondering if maybe I have anxiety. In recent months I've had two experiences that could have been anxiety or panic attacks, but I'm not sure. I would really like some input on these situations.

Experience 1 (Kinda long-winded, sorry):

I was visiting Seattle with my mom, and as always when traveling I felt less comfortable than at home. On one day, I felt on-edge and jumpy in general but for no specific reason. It started with the eerily quiet vibe of our hotel that was patrolled by a security guard. Then later I saw a kid with his parents who were wasted on the sidewalk. After that, my mom and I visited a glass art museum. It was fascinating, but when I walked past an exhibit, all at once I felt super off-balance and not in control of my body. I had the sudden invasive thought that I could easily fall and smash into the intricate glass display. From then on I felt very uncomfortable and a little out of breath. Following the museum experience, I had another concerning thought when our car backed over a piece of trash. The idea popped into my head that it was a person or animal, which I know sounds insane.

Now, here is where I started to panic - if that's even the right term to use. Back at the hotel, my mom and I put on some TV. I felt very overwhelmed and I suddenly felt so, so incredibly scared. I started crying and went over to my mom. The draft in the hotel or other residents caused a distant sound that could have been doors opening and closing, but it started to terrify me. I thought I was going to die in that hotel room, and I was bawling uncontrollably. It was the most terrified I've ever been, even though nothing was actually wrong. At the worst point, I thought my mom maybe wasn't real while I was huddled up against her. God it was so scary; I hate to think about it.

The next day I was exhausted. My mom wanted to visit another, smaller art gallery. When I got inside, I got a little bit breathless and teary-eyed and was relieved when we left.

Experience 2:

This one is a lot milder. I recently stopped drinking coffee because of my nerves, but one day after school I couldn't resist a pumpkin cold brew. I drank it on my walk home. By the time I arrived, my nerves were really acting up, but it was nothing I hadn't felt before.

This is when things started to change. I was scrolling on my phone, and I came across an obviously fake video that spooked me nonetheless. It was stupid - about this guy who kept hearing his own voice talking back to him in his dimly lit apartment. I put my phone down, and my nerves started to bubble up. I started to see movements in the corner of my eyes that disappeared right away. I looked at my hands and they didn't feel like my own, so I tried to stop looking at them. There was a pulsing in my arm, and I felt a little breathless. I also had a minor pain in my chest, which I've read is a common panic symptom.

However, after maybe 5 minutes of sitting still and taking deep breaths, the symptoms subsided. It was not bad at all.

If you read this whole thing, I really would appreciate an opinion on these experiences; It would be very helpful. Thank you!",anxiety

"Anyone else scared of their own anxiety? Sometimes I scare myself because I feel like I’m too mentally ill, or at least that I talk like it. I just worry that I intimidate people from my depressive/anxious thoughts that I share with them.

People sometimes react concerned which I appreciate them being, but in reality I know I’m fine and if not, I know that I’ll be fine. I’m just really self conscious about it now, I don’t want people to think they need to be concerned about me. I think back to some things I’ve shared and think “does this sound too insane?” because I always end up rationalizing it later on and thinking how dumb whatever I was saying was.

"This is how I solved 90% of my Anxiety I wanted to share something that helped me tremendously when it comes to dealing with my anxiety, and something that increased my life satisfaction overall. If nothing, stick around for the funny story at the end.

**Who am I?**   
31 year old male who has had anxiety until the age of 30 - so, most of my life. I didn't know I had it until I started going to therapy.   
I was always the person who everyone told to ""relax"" - but I never know what that meant. I was relaxed *in my perception of myself*. Everyone told me I was always so ""tense"" - in my thinking and ways of life.  
I remember constantly going through tough (read: bad) situations in my mind; for example, in my thoughts, I was perhaps fighting someone or someone was attacking me from the shadows when I was walking in a shady alley (this never happened in real life, but my mind has made it up). I had a lot of thoughts where I argued with people - never to reach a happy ending or an agreement, it always ended with a conflict.

So, unrelated to all of this, I started going to psychotherapy. After a year of going perhaps once or twice a week, I started recognizing more and more what anxiety was. It was sometimes mixed with, what I like to call, depression - but my psychotherapist refuses to accept that, because it's not chronic. And I agree, it was not chronic, but more like daily occurences of emptied out reserves of happy molecules, and lack of ambition. (I also kind of solved this afterwards as well, so I might write a post in the future about that). So I was feeling bad during the day. And of course, had lots of negative thoughts - arguing with people, imagining bad outcomes in my day-to-day job, being rejected by people, and so on.

**What helped?**  
So, at the beginning of the year (2024), I had a lot of anxiety. Both related to work and to my health (incidentaly I had increased my salt intake during one week and my blood pressure suffered, so being the anxious person that I am, I kept imagining it going so bad that I'd die). And I started having some kind of flashes of anxiety - I never had those before, so the situation seemed to have gotten way worse than what it was previously. The flashes were manifested in increased heart rate and tensing up - probably my blood pressure suffered as well - and also an array of negative thoughts. 

So I was laying one night in my bed and was going through the flashes. I couldn't help them whatever I did. I told myself to ""just stop fucking thinking negatively"" and, of course, it didn't help. Then I started to realize something - it never helps anyone to tell them to *stop doing something*, but instead, reframe it & motivate someone to *start doing something*. That was the game changer. I told myself -  
\- Okay, you're arguing with someone in your mind right now. How about you hug them in, instead?   
So I did. And then:  
\- How about they also apologize to you and tell you you've been right all along? (this goes in the direction of the conflict I've been having with people, who in my mind were telling me I'm wrong about some things)  
And I did. And they apologized. 

And I started crying. I've felt like the turntable has happened (had to say it like that, I'm *The Office* fan).   
I was being engulfed with positive emotions, like my body started to heal finally from all the trauma.

Sadly (or luckily, because I was about to learn how to strengthen my positive thinking), another flash of anxiety & negative thoughts came up as I was having these nice thoughts, after such a long time.  
\- No, FUCK you! (I've said to myself)  
I managed to turn them around into something positive again. And more crying ensued. 

From this point on, I learned to start thinking positively in my life. And I found myself SMILING! Constantly!  
*How does that look like?* Well, I imagine goofy stuff which brings me lots of joy. For example, if I was at a pool and I walked by three girls (who by the way ignored me) I thought afterwards how they approached me and told me how nice I look. Or if I ended a call / job meeting which I didn't like how it went, I imagined in my head that it went exactly how I wanted it to go, and that everyone praised me for my contributions.

It didn't matter that this didn't happen (or maybe won't ever happen), and I wasn't delusional. I knew that I was imagining it, and that I cannot always be right, or that I cannot be the prettiest guy in the room and that everyone will like me.   
But in my mind, I was. And, boy, did that change my perspective on life. It manifested some *crazy good shit* into reality just became of my positive framing.

**What I learned from it**  
I learned that I had some unhealed trauma in my life - and you might have guessed it, about being right, about being liked, and so on. So in my mind I started making up situations where I was the prettiest, I was always right  and that I was having a lovely time with everyone - there were no arguments, fights, or things of that sort.

Now I have set up events in my calendar to remind me to think ""happy thoughts"" 2x per week, and for 10 minutes only. I come refreshed out of it. 

Whenever I am feeling bad, if I remember to reframe those feelings, or just think of something good happening to me. 

**Do you want to try it? How will you know if it works for you?**  
Please note, if you try this for yourself and it doesn't work - try to see if, when you shift around your perspective from bad to good, does your mind say: ""No, this can't be right. I cannot be this liked / loved / right / pretty""? If so, CONVINCE IT that it is fucking possible! Your mind will try to stop you at first, because it's been that way for years / decades, it probably  won't allow you to shift your perspective that fast. It might, but you also might need to ""battle it out"".  
You will know it works for you if:  
\- tension starts dropping  
\- you start feeling good throughout your body  
\- you start crying (if unresolved trauma)  
**- you start SMILING** 

I hope this helps at least one person, the way it helped me. Have a nice day, reader!

**Funny story**  
I was having lunch with my parents and I finally had the courage to bring up the topic of anxiety, now that I've learned to recognize it & deal with it. So I asked my dad, who is a very intelligent person, with a PhD, if he has anxiety perhaps, because he is kind of a negative person. This is what he said:   
\- Hey dad, do you think you have anxiety?  
\- Anxiety, what's that? Some modern problem of your generation?  
\- No, it's when you think of negative thoughts all the time. Like thinking about bad scenarios which might happen.  
\- No I don't have it. But yes I do think a lot about negative scenarios because I'm trying to prevent them. For example, I think of all the things that might go bad, so when they actually happen, I am prepared for them. Have you read Sun Tzu and ""The Art of War""? He said that preparation is most of the battle.

*\*queue me thinking how to tell him that this is exactly what anxiety is\**  
  
\- Well, dad, does that mean you're preparing for war in your head constantly, what kind of life is that?

*\*now he stopped to think, which he hasn't done in a long time, since he usually just spews out answers\**

\- Well, heh, maybe. 

By now I think he was embarrassed that anyone actually outwitted him in a sense, because he enjoys winning conversations. But also I think - no, I hope - that he reflected a bit on his life so far.",anxiety
"Recent panic attacked had caused new anxiety Hi everyone. I have never posted in a Reddit sub before so this is all new to me. Sorry in advance if there are any grammar issues or misspelling. Also I have never really dealt with anxiety before this. 

3 days ago I had a my first ever severe panic attack while having a late night snack and gaming. I immediately ran up to my fiancés and I’s room and woke up her up asked her to take me to the hospital. I really thought I was having a heart attack. I am overweight so I immediately thought the worst. The hospital trip was fine, blood work came back fine, thyroid looked perfectly normal, blood pressure was a little high, but nothing to freak over. Now ever since this had happened it’s like it has unlocked a level of anxiety that I have never experienced before. I have been constantly overthinking EVERYTHING it’s like my brain refuses to shut up for even a second. I feel like I’m in a revolving door. Constant sweating and freaking out. My stomach is in shambles (stomach pain and diarrhea) and anytime I try to eat anything, healthy or not my body acts like it’s going into shutdown mode. Eating is when I feel my anxiety at its highest. It’s like my brain has linked eating to my sever panic attack that I had and will barely let me eating anything at all let alone hold on down. It’s like my brain thinks if I eat it’s going to cause another panic attack and I might die. This new anxiety has made me feel so on edge ever since this event. I feel like I’m starting to go crazy. This is all so new to me. Any tips or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance. ",anxiety
"Muteness Hi everybody,

So ever since I remember I had this thing where I just froze, unable to speak in stressful situations. Usually when I felt i dissapointed someone, or I had to talk about feelings, and to this day I cannot talk when I have to talk feelings. It usually comes with crying and I can usually nod but any other type of communication I just can't do it. I have everything I want to say on repeat in my head I keep telling myself to just talk yet I can't.

And basically I'm just interested if someone knows what it is or how to overcome this. I've read about selective mutism but I don't think it's that because  the diagnostic criteria requires isolation, effect on social life/education and consistency and with me this muteness only truly happens with feelings talk.

"Physical symptoms of anxiety during grieving Hey all,

I’ve had health anxiety for years. I’ve recently been triggered by my dads lengthy illness, surgeries and ultimately death. I was hoping to hear others physical symptoms and how they cope with them. 

My symptoms started in July with chest pain in the center of my chest and palpitations that got worse at night. I had two urgent care visits, EKGS (normal) and now ultimately am wearing a heart monitor with upcoming echo/stress test. 

The chest pain has been replaced with tingling arms and legs. At first it was once in awhile, a sleepy foot, etc. Since his death Friday, I have had continuous tingling and cold arms/legs. I also feel like I always have to pee, no UTI. 

I have a neurologist who wants me to rule out MS as I previously hit my head and triggered migraines due to mild traumatic brain injury. 

She said she didn’t think I should worry as MS patients don’t have short bouts of symptoms, but rather larger ones. Now she’s  urging me to get my MRI done so I have one coming Tuesday. Trying to calm myself down in the meantime. I have been trying to keep dad alive since July and I think I overdid it and am heading into a bad place physically with my brain and heart. My nerves are literally shot. I’m desperate to make it through his services this weekend without getting worse. ",anxiety

"If I need to tell my therapist to teach me coping skills, are they the wrong therapist for me? I've been receiving therapy for around a month now. I meet with my clinician once every week.

I was extremely happy going in to it because I didn't want to be depressed and anxious about everything anymore. But when I talked to my therapist i kind of didn't feel too impressed. Sorry, I know how arrogant this sounds. I think they're just not the right one for me...?

But I digress, I practiced what I preach and continued to see this therapist despite being kind of unimpressed. It's kind of early. Perhaps I'm just being too pessimistic...

But idk... I think this is my fourth or fifth time seeing them now and I kind of feel like nothing is actually working...

Don't get me wrong. I'm happy my therapist told me x and y. But the big issue is - I need a job. I need to make money... I don't got a lot of money left and pretty soon I will be homeless... I'd like to be able to talk to a coworker and not feel threatened and or competitive. it ruined a ton of my relationships with coworkers. And not just coworkers. But basically family and friends too...!

My therapist is teaching me a lot of things, such as what depression is and how each example I'm giving him of my past events are affecting my life. But I don't think they are helpful. I feel like I am just talking to a robot. If I don't start the conversation, my therapist doesn't talk to me. It's kind of awkward.. most of the things they tell me, it's kind of just them reading in the between the lines and rephrasing what I said back to me.

Today felt extremely bad because I had to take a bus to see the therapist (I don't usually take the bus). I got a bit confused with the bus system so I texted my therapist if it was okay I was going to be a little late. They text back and said ""it's okay. We can have a shorter session today"". Which made me feel like A) extremely disrespected B) I wasnt getting my money's worth

And then to top it off. My therapist always looks at the time and tells me something along the lines of ""oops, won't you look at that. We've been talking for so long. Times flies by"". When in reality I feel like I was the only one doing any sort of talking.

I need resources like coping skills. The reason I came here in the first place today was because my therapists told me we'd work on breathing techniques and stuff to stop feeling anxious in a certain scenario. But whenever I get to see my therapist, they always don't remember what we were talking about and it makes me feel like I'm a unimportant or something.

After a whole month with them, I was finally thinking it's time to look for a different therapist, but I can't talk to them about it because I'm afraid of confrontations and stuff. I get anxiety thinking about it. I don't got family or friends and currently nobody knows I'm seeing a therapist for depression (I was clinically diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder here, but the initial reason I came to therapy was because I think I knew I had depression).

I don't want to be mean but I think I'm just wasting time... It's cool I'm finally brushing my teeth and taking a shower like normal again, now. I think my therapist kind of helped steer me towards this progress, but it's off course... Hopefully somebody understands what I mean...

I'm a 25 year old female struggling with health anxiety for more then a decade.
For the entire time my mom has been my support, she's the most important person in my life and she loves me very much but things just got too much for her.
For about a week I got some really bad anxiety about a certain symptom and went to the doctor who told it's nothing but I didn't believe him and I told my mom that on the phone right after the appointment and she started crying saying it's never going to end.

I started a new anxiety medication after the last one didn't work and when I got home(I live by myself) my mom called me on a video call to see that I'm taking the new med and I saw she looked distressed so I told her everything will be fine once the new med will kick in and just went to sleep to calm my mind thinking that's where it ends....

I was dead wrong.

2 hours later I was awaken by a phone call from my mom's boyfriend who lives with her(we have a father daughter relationship)
and just screamed at me saying he came home early to my mom being blue, half breathing and surrounded by her own vomit after she had an extreme panic attack and her body collapsed, an ambulance came and gave her an adrenaline shot. I was just shocked and didn't understand fully because I was still sleepy, he yelled at me saying I'm a danger to her and that if I'll try to call any of them they won't answer and hang up.

I got a bad BAD anxiety attack and my best friend came to be with me.
After a few hours he started sending me awful texts saying that I'm disgusting and I should be ashamed of myself for doing this to my mom, saying that if I dare to call them I'll get hospitalized at a mental hospital and that now I have a ""business"" with him. I almost fainted from my attack after that.

It's been 5 days and my mom didn't call me and I'm so afraid and ashamed to call her I just want to hug her and tell her how sorry I am.

I fell to deep depression, I feel empty and alone, I hate myself so much.",anxiety
"Stuck in a never ending cycle  I go through relentless cycles of anxiety. The moment I stop worrying about one thing, my mind quickly finds something else to latch onto, spinning me into another spiral. It’s exhausting, like my brain can’t settle down, always searching for the next thing to stress over. And on the rare occasions when I do feel calm, I start worrying about why I’m not anxious. It’s as if my mind can’t accept peace, always needing something to fret about.

"I’m at My Wits End I just need to type this out.

I’m so frustrated. I have severe generalized anxiety disorder as well as PTSD that causes me to be hyper vigilant. It’s hard to work. I have a low stress job, but I’m in an office 8-5 Monday through Friday and the level of anxiety I have just from being out of my house and around people is absurd. There are days where it’s almost unbearable to sit at my desk and do nothing because my anxiety is so high, to the point I’ve almost had to go home early (except that also makes me anxious). I was in therapy 1-3 times a week for four months while recovering from an eating disorder (something I was using to cope with my anxiety temporarily). I’ve been in therapy before as well. I have yet to find a strategy that helps me lower my baseline anxiety. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist and she’s at the point where she doesn’t really know what to do either. Buspar makes me so lethargic and dizzy that I can’t get up. Hydroxyzine makes me too tired for daily use. Benzodiazepines are only for short term use and I need a long term solution (I’ve been dealing with anxiety since I was 10). Gabapentin didn’t help with my anxiety. Her next choice was Rexulti, which I won’t take because it lowers blood pressure and mine already runs low so I might pass out if it gets lower. I won’t take SSRIs or SNRIs after ending up in the hospital while taking Prozac. I feel like I’ve tried to very thing. I don’t want to keep taking medication. I’m so sick of the side effects, on top of the fact that I’m having other health issues I’m trying to figure out (I keep almost passing out at least once a day).

I don’t want anxiety to keep me from living my life. I have ambitions and dreams. But the longer this goes on the more I wonder if I’m going to have to call it and live off disability pay because I can’t be in public. My last effort is trying a psychiatric service dog and praying that that’ll make it so I can work and maybe even handle social events like concerts or shows without panic attacks. I’m planning on getting a puppy around Christmas and it’ll take months to get basic training done, but maybe it’ll be worth it. I hope so.",anxiety

"Constant Urge to Pee and Urinary Hesitancy—Could This Be Anxiety? Hi everyone,

I’m dealing with a frustrating problem and would appreciate any advice or shared experiences. Lately, I’ve had this constant feeling of needing to pee, even when my bladder isn’t full. I also struggle with urinary hesitancy—when I try to go, it takes a while to start, but once I do, I’m able to fully empty my bladder.

To make things more complicated, I’m taking olanzapine, which I know can sometimes cause urinary side effects. I was doing okay on 10 mg for a couple of weeks, but recently, I’ve been dealing with these urinary issues. I even tried going to the ER and talking to specialists, but no clear answers so far. My psychiatrist and I are now trying a lower dose (7.5 mg) to see if it helps, but I’m also wondering if anxiety could be a big part of the problem.

The sensation feels like a stinging or urge to pee at the tip of my penis, which is constant and super distracting. It’s really taking a toll on my mental health. I keep wondering if anxiety might be making this worse, or if I should look into other possible causes with a urologist.

If anyone has dealt with something similar, especially if it was anxiety-related, I’d love to hear about it. I’m just hoping to find a way to manage this and get back to feeling normal.

Thanks for reading and any advice you can offer!",anxiety
"Everyone and everything makes me anxious I'm feeling incredibly exhausted and depressed. The thought of going to school fills me with anxiety, and I've completely lost my motivation to continue, and im constantly absent in some of my classed. I'm seriously considering dropping out, but I know that's not a realistic option in a third-world country where a college degree is essential for even a minimum-wage job.

Taking a gap year seems appealing, but I'm worried it would be a waste of time and academic progress and my family would most likely not support it either. I've chosen a course that doesn't interest me, and I lack any real ambition or drive. No course in general interests me. All I want to do is stay in bed and avoid the world. I can't imagine myself having a successful career.

I've tried to force myself to enjoy school and complete assignments, but I always fall back into procrastination and negativity. I've sought help from a school counselor and tried to followed her advice, but I keep relapsing.

I have no idea what to do, i genuienly need help. I have no one to talk to about this. I came to reddit as a last resort.",anxiety
"Stomach issues and heartburn causing me to spiral  I’ve always had issues with heartburn once in a while after a certain meal but recently it’s felt worse.

"Weaning off Zoloft... I've been in the process of weaning off of my ssri for the last 6 months.

I find myself questioning if I'm going to be okay or take a total tailspin. Anybody been here and made it out okay? I'm starting to panic and think I can't do it.

"My anxiety gets in the way of my entire life? I struggle to meet new friends, so I cling to the ones I have. But I lost a close friend and now I'm down to like 1. I feel like everywhere I go people don't like me, I don't fit in, so I just show up and leave (like school or work). Then I feel lonely and sad because I couldn't make any friends, when other people do it so easily.



It gets in the way of my relationship too because I always think I'm ugly, not good enough, I can't be in the moment and just calm down. I always have so much on my mind and everything feels like a big thing to me. So I can't just let my guard down and feel present and peaceful.

  
It affects my career because I give up on every job or career idea so easily because I'm scared I won't be good enough, or I don't know how to get started, and I have nobody to ask for help.

  
The world is going mad and of course that doesn't help because it's just more things for me to be anxious about. My entire personality is different now because I can't even have fun or be a generally happy person anymore. Therapy didn't help, nor did meds. What do I do?",anxiety
"How to overcome random anxiety ? Few months back I got a vitamin D deficiency, and ever since that I get anxiety from no where. 

Im not an anxious person at all, infact i probably never got anxiety ever in my life untill this point.

First time I got a panic attack and then later on I get anxiety thinking i might get another panic attack. It's all symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. But now, my deficiency is fine, i took supplements, all severe symptoms are gone now but i still get anxiety.

I get random anxiety attacks, but sometimes there are few triggers

My triggers are :

Going to a crowded location with lots of people 
Like - mall, movie theatre, hotels

I had severe anxiety for going to the barber, my head spins while I sit on the chair. Now it's gone but rarely I get it.

And Food, if I didn't get it at the right time I wanted, I get dizzy and anxiety 

How i cope with it:

Deep breaths, jumping around, or eat
And Saying to my inner mind that it's okay, it's just feelings, it will go away, and sometimes I shout ""I'm healthy, it's just anxiety""

Or I think of something positive 

These techniques works most of the times, but there are some dark days.

I would like to know if any other techniques to prevent these attacks, or make it go away once it comes.

Thanks !",anxiety
"I don't believe I have anxiety what is this? Doctors keep saying i have anxiety but I feel I have control and am able to control myself, the issue for me feels like more of a physiological response that causes increased anxiety for me. As an example there's times where I get super derealized which will typically make me anxious, I was horrible at managing that before but now I feel i am able to put up with it and know im safe and feel reassured that I will be fine once I get rest or something and know its more temporary. when I go on long drives I feel really really weird getting out of the car, like almost dizzy and derealizaed also, and most the time im lacking energy. I feel unable to do work and feel my brain is always numbed out and disconnected from everything instead of feeling what I would consider to be normal. I had low cortisol months ago in response to an acth stimulation test and recently got my cortisol levels checked again and my acth which were normal but didn't do the stimulation test again, if anything was abnormal the acth should have been high. I assumed this was the issue for months but now I really don't know all I know is im never taking anxiety medication again because it fucked me up so bad last time, lexapro and buspirone caused me so much pain and fucked up my brain over time. I was so tired i felt like I was dying also it fucked me up bad when i smoked weed while on it, I was screaming and almost hallucinating and thought I died for a second. I also took Accutane a few years ago and that gave me brain fog also. I don't trust medications now and it honestly seems remarkable there's so many people on these subreddits that say they've tried so many medications and act like they love medication. I assume these people are just so far gone now and don't realize it because our brain chemistry is so sensitive no one understands. So I ask what am i supposed to do because I don't know anymore and my endocrinologist said hes not rescheduling an appointment if everything comes back normal. I've had other very clear and obvious symptoms for other physical issues I've had and what im starting to learn about the medical establishments is they don't really commonly diagnose people, I never get clear answers even after years. Is anyone else struggling with this because this is bullshit and there has to be a better approach to all this. Thankyou.",anxiety

"I screwed up and skipped my meds for 4 days. Now what? Honestly not sure if this ok or even a good place to ask this but hoped maybe someone else has done it and knows what you’re supposed to do after.

I bought a week long pill case thing to fill weekly with my meds and supplements so I don’t have to open it all nightly. I made an extra one the night I filled it. So 8 days. Tonight I noticed I had an extra salt pill in my slot so I opened the next one thinking it would be missing. It wasn’t but I realized my Fluoxetine wasn’t there. Opened the 3 remaining slots and NONE have it. 

I can only logically assume that the first 4 didn’t have it, either. Idk how I messed it up this badly but I guess I skipped that bottle when I filled it and somehow didn’t even notice it was missing all this time? I’ve been “sick” all week. I now realize it was actually withdrawal. I know how that feels but guess my brain didn’t catch on because I had no reason to be in withdrawal. 

So I fixed the remaining slots and took one for today but should I take extra to make up for what I missed or does it not work like that? 

I went through 3 weeks of HELL waiting for this med to kick in. Did I just RESET that?! Or is 4 days not enough for it to totally leave my system? I’m worried because the withdrawal was a lot better today. I’ll be so mad if I have to do that 3 week bullshit all over again because I messed up filling a pill holder. Ugh",anxiety

"Is this a Panic Attack? Background

27, overweight. On 10mg per day of dexamphetamine (ADHD medication). Have been on adhd medication for a month or so. Before starting medication I would smoke marijuana on and off periods. Since starting the ADHD medication, I found giving into my addictive tendencies heavily reduced.

2 nights ago I had a little bit of weed. Had been almost 2 months since last smoking weed  which was a long period for me. Felt good. Went about my night playing some video games. Last night I intended to do the same thing, except I smoked a little more than the previous night. After about 20 minutes I started to feel disassociation. Like I was losing my mind. I went to lay down and bring with my own thoughts laying down just made things worse.
I started to freak out, breathing heavily, heart racing. My heart started to feel like it was going to burst out of my chest. I thought I was dying. I honestly feel like it was the closest I've ever been to death. Started questioning my life, wa so upset and ashamed that this is how I was going. I couldn't bear the thought of leaving my pregnant wife behind.  Felt like my life was flashing before my eyes. Eventually it settled, I calmed down. I was worried I was having a heart attack, and debated calling an ambulance. I convinced myself that how I'm feeling is just amplified due to the weed, so decided to wait it out and think about wtf happened coherently the next morning. 

It is now the next day, about 18 hours since. I still have chest pain but feel like it comes on more when thinking about last night.

I'm scared. Was it a panic attack? I think it was but what if it was a heart attack?  I just feel like my brain is all over the place and don't know what to do.",anxiety
"First timer anxiety / panic attack I would like to go see a doctor - but it’s Saturday morning and my usual GP I go to only opens on Monday. Should I go to a different GP just to get help or should I wait it out to go see a doctor that knows my history? 

A little backstory. I have been suffering with chronic muscle pain for years. (12 years to be accurate) I have seen multiple doctors and specialists regarding this and they’re still trying to pin point what exactly is the matter. Note that I have only actively started looking into/treating the muscle pain for the last 5 years. And I can only afford to see a specialist once a year max so it is a slow progress.

Now these passed three weeks I have been noticing signs of anxiety. Tight chest, numb feeling - which are also symptoms of my chronic muscle pain. Buttt I also started getting really angry and irritated for no reason, I started feeling dizzy all the time and the tight chest felt more like a tight heart than the usual tight chest I get from my chronic pain. 

So last night, my fiancé wanted to go shower, and I switched off the geyser to save electricity. This is a common thing for us to do. He got a little irritated because getting out of a cold shower, even if it’s a common thing for us to do to switch off the geyser, you really hate yourself a bit for not checking if the geyser was on. When I say he got a little irritated, I really mean a LITTLE, his reaction was minor and it completely tipped me over. 

I started with a cramp to the side of my rib cage, which is also common with my chronic pain, however this cramp/spasm felt minor to what I’m usually used to. Shortly after the cramp/spasm my heartbeat started rising and I got even dizzier and a bit more shakier. I immediately started crying and I didn’t understand why I was crying. I started getting irritated for being silly for crying for no reason and then I started to struggle to breath and this set off another sense of panic and overwhelmingness.

A little while after I realised this may be a panic/anxiety attack and I need to calm myself down. I tried getting my breathing under control and I would eventually start breathing fine but still left traumatised. A little after that the breathing situation would flare up again and then I had to try and relax and focus on my breathing. This happened approximately 9-11 times within the next 90minutes or so… I was obviously not concerned about time or keeping a tally during this time. 

I obviously spent a bit of time on google after I managed to stay calm and breath normally again and most articles recommended seeing a doctor to make sure it was in fact and anxiety/panic attack and not some other underlying issue. Now the problem is that I know I have chronic pain and a different GP that’s not familiar with my personality nor my history might request a bunch of tests which could potentially lead to a delayed diagnosis and/or unnecessary expenses (the unnecessary expense part is pretty important for me right now, I mean we’re getting married soon and we’re paying for it ourselves). But also, Monday still feels pretty far away and I’m not even sure if I will get that appointment on Monday - there’s a possibility my doctor may only have an opening Tuesday or Wednesday. So what do I do? And if anyone has any helpful tips please send them this way, I’m scared to go back to that place of pure panic and I still don’t feel 100% comfortable to go by my day. ",anxiety
"It never ends I've been super stressed. Also my PMDD has been acting up, so of course I'm getting really bad intrusive thoughts and hate myself and hate everyone else but still- Nobody gets better, not people with anxiety, or drug addicts, or anyone. There is no better. There's just living, day by day until you inevitably fuck yourself over again, then the cycle repeats. It's all so fucking tedious. I've been stuck this way my whole life. I get ""better"", I manage to leave the house and eat more and make friends, then something will trigger a breakdown and I'll be right back to wallowing in my bedroom, cutting myself and listening to sad music, wishing I was dead. It never ends. All those slightly happy, slightly ""better"" moments don't seem worth it to me. I'll never be normal and I'll never be happy. I'll never hold a job down, or get a partner, I'll never leave this house. I'll never have a good life. I'll die, by my own hand at a young age, like I've always known.

"Propanolol when you have a baseline low heart rate/low blood pressure? Howdy!

"Does anyone else get anxiety/panic attacks when riding in the back seat? Some backstory:
About 2 years ago I was on vacation with my fiancé’s family and we decided to ride with them to dinner. I ended up being wedged in the middle of the third row between my fiance and his brother in law. All my life I have been fine with backseats and third rows until that day. I’m not sure if it was the fact that my fiance’s nephew was crying, the parents arguing, or the driving around in circles trying to find a spot to eat set me off but I had a full blown panic attack back there. I needed to get out asap and ended up pulling myself forward into the middle row. We ended up walking back to the house after dinner because there was no way I was riding back like that. Ever since that day I have the hardest time sitting in the backseat of a car. I get a huge wave of panic and feel like I can’t breathe and have the biggest urge to get out of there. I’ve tried deep breathing and eating mints but nothing is helping. Tomorrow I have to get into an uber with 4 other people and I am freaking out thinking about it. I feel crazy.

"Passing up a job opportunity  Fairly recently, my boss told me there would be a job opportunity opening up at my place of employment. I thought about it, and decided to go for it and apply. Because you don’t know if you don’t try right? Well a month passed since I applied, and I started to be ok with everything. I felt like it was indicative that it wasn’t my time. They went with someone else. I had moved on and was content with at least putting my name in the hat.

Everything changed on Wednesday.
I got notified I moved onto the next stage of the interview process and was given the pre-interview assignments. Suddenly, I felt the biggest pit in my stomach. I didn’t understand the questions. The more I thought about the job, I delved into a panic attack. I didn’t eat much. I cried so much. I felt like my world was ending. I got feedback from a few other upper managers at my job and I got a variation of ‘do what’s right for you, but what’s the harm in doing the assignments?’… and after a while I started to agree with them. I thought to try to do the assignments, but when I tried all the panic attack feelings came back. I felt so much dread. I just couldn’t do it. I think there’s something to be said about feeling this way about a job I don’t even have and there’s no guarantee I would get it. 

I don’t think it’s wrong acknowledging that it’s not the right fit, that I’m content in my current position, and I don’t want to move up the ladder at this moment in time. But I struggle with being a people pleaser and the feeling like I let people down. And that’s what I felt like, I felt like I was letting those around me down for not going for it. But I had to do what’s right for me. 

I let the proper personnel know that the job was not a good fit for me, I thanked them for the opportunity, and I wished them all the luck in finding the best candidate. I got a response from a top management telling me they understood, but they really encouraged me to do the assignment, that my background would help me and it’s supposed to be difficult. 

And all those feelings of feeling like I let someone down came back up. I don’t want to leave this place. It’s not perfect, but I don’t hate my job. I’m content, I have a good group of people around me. It just doesn’t feel right to change jobs. The grass isn’t always greener on the other side. My biggest fear is what if I get this job, but six months in I realize it wasn’t a good fit, but I can’t go back to my old job.

"Trouble dealing with constant anxiety these past few months my anxiety has been getting worse by the day and it's getting scary. It's gotten to the point now where I'm anxious as much as I'm awake. to deal with the anxiety I had a year ago I started smoking weed and I've been doing so every single day for about 10 months. cannabis has been the only thing that truly helped me deal with my anxiety through daily life. however I clearly depend on it and I have enough reasons to believe it's bad for me but I just don't know how to fill the gap. I feel like nothing I'm trying is helping me, not the 5 different antidepressants that were supposed to help with anxiety nor the xanaxes or other benzodiazepines that I just hate taking, not the CBD, not the therapy, not the people around me doing so much to help me , not me, straight nothing.

When I felt it it felt like my beat was missing or fading and stopped and I instantly felt doom and weak and hot and I was like WOAH. I was 20 miles from home, phone was gonna die and I called 911 and laid down and felt horrible with shaking and tension in my chest, trembling and weakness.

If so, what worked for you?

Anxiety attack that felt like I was on acid.  I was out at a restaurant and I thought my food was drugged because it felt like I was having an acid trip.

"I went from loving my job to hating it So I got a job last year at a retirement home working in their kitchen, and it was a wonderful change of pace from restaurant work. 
All the equipment was in great shape, my manager kept everything sparkly clean, and I was working with two older women, who I got along with pretty well.
One of them had some kind of learning disability and she and I clicked on a way I didn’t with the rest of the staff.
Well, a few months ago my manager left for her vacation which she had been planning for six months and she was out of the country.
Both my coworkers quit the week before her vacation and she had to bring an ex employee back who was an older man, very backwoods blue collar guy who definitely makes an effort to be positive and he is nice to me, but he’s a lot more easily stressed by the lunch rush and sometimes he goes on really bigoted rants out of nowhere.

So my manager left for vacation and it was just me and him alone together for nine days straight. 
During that week, the hurricanes hit the area we’re at pretty hard and we lost running water for three days.
His cousin died in the flood. 
We both continued to show up for work but I could tell he was losing his grip and one day he went off and started screaming at one of the nurses.
I started binging weed just to get through everything and when my manager got back, she seemed totally clueless about the kind of hell we’d been through and asked me about my new girlfriend and I had to remind her that I hadn’t seen her at all in two weeks because I was locked away in that building. 
My manager gave me an extra day off that week to recooperate but ever since then I just hate my job. I don’t wanna look at that kitchen anymore.
My girlfriend left me and I’ve been a depressed anxious wreck.
I got put on SSRIs this week, and I’m getting better but I still fucking hate my job.

I felt this way about my old job after Covid hit and screwed everything up and I was there for four years.
It’s like I associate it forever now with that one really bad week and it feels like every time I clock in I’m reliving it all over again. 
I’ve been applying for new jobs but not going to any interviews because I can’t tell if I really want to leave or if my brain is just doing some weird glitch. ",anxiety

2: Misinformation doesn't just come from loons or conmen, your average internet citizen can be just as misled or worried as you, but just manifest it in more direct ""X WILL doubtlessly happen"" mentality.

"Therapy is not working? Hi there. This is my first time seeing a therapist in person, after jumping around tele / virtual therapy for a couple of years. I’ve been going this therapist for 5 months but I feel I am not making any progress, and feel I am getting worse? What do I do?

I left a stable but stagnant job I had for 7 years at the beginning of the year. Got rid of my apartment, went to a new city to take a chance on a role potentially . However it was bait and switch and didn’t work out. I was essentially humiliated on the way out despite all the positives I accomplished.

Over the last couple of months, i've been fired from a job, misdiagnosed with High blood pressure, anxiety and a week ago my granphather die.

It all started in July, when they fired me from my job, because they couldn't relocate me to another place. And after a month my anxiety attacks and accumulated stress began, i went to the doctor and he told me i had hypertension. I Quit smoking cigarettes (after more than 10 years of smoking), quit soda and salt all together)

I spent 2 months taking Enalapril without feeling any physical improvement, but my blood pressure was always perfect. My aunt and uncle, who are hypertensive, told me to stop taking it because it was lowering my blood pressure too much.

I realized that it was not Hypertension and that it was stress. To all this, I have had shoulder pain for more than two months, I don't know if it is due to anxiety or because I sleep poorly. And honestly im so tired of feeling this pain, i really dont know what it is. And im so scared of going to the doctors.

After that, my grandfather had a stroke and I had to take care of him alone since my entire family was out of the country he sadly passed away 5 days latter

Now I have become more anxious than ever, I am afraid of dying, I am afraid of everything. I'm afraid to go out into the streets and feel like I'm going to die right there.

"Put on meds without being told they’re beta blockers?! I was diagnosed with anxiety early this year, I was shocked at the diagnosis but after research, I feel like I finally have an answer to A LOT.

My panic attacks and chest pains (what I thought were heart attacks) were the main problem as well as my overstimulation and constantly thinking the worst. 

I have a history with adverse effects on medication and therefore I am always reluctant to take them. When my doctor told me that she had meds to help I naturally had many questions.

The first was whether they would affect my brain chemistry as I didn’t want to feel “numb” and these tablets didn’t. They were sold to me as a dream, they only target physical effects or anxiety i.e. they help with chest tightness and generally calm me down. When I asked potential side effects, I was told “they may cause some stomach upset but that’s it”. Backstory, I have PCOS and suspected endo which causes me to suffer everyday with stomach pains which we still haven’t gotten to the bottom of. So why the doctor thought these tablets were good for me based off my records, I have zero idea. However, I was willing to take the risk and compared to other meds, these seemed a dream.

I was told take them once a day and don’t stop them until you’ve consulted a GP and you’re good to go. After a week, I was suffering even worse with my chest tightness and overall mental stability so I checked the leaflet inside the packaging (I know I should have done this before) and found that these were in fact beta blockers. Since, I have tried contacting the GP so I know I can safely get off these meds but I cannot get through to them for the life of me. 

Bottom line, I’m stuck on this medication that I wasn’t properly informed about and it’s put me in a state of mania and psychosis, not to mention worsening my symptoms. I have filed a complaint with the GP about this and other negligent actions but is this as bad as I think it is?? I know this is a lot but I wanted to give a back story so it’s understood:)

"Post-anxiety health issues 26F pretty much anxious my whole life but definitely more so feeling the health effects from it in my mid 20s. 

As a teen, my anxiety just gave me momentary heart racing, feeling of nervousness. Really just normal sensations.

Now, especially around my cycle, I tend to get manic almost. And my health suffers from it. And if I am happy, it feels so odd. Which increases the feelings of mania. Happiness does not bring me calm, only indifference does. 

When the anxiety passes, I have fatigue, headaches, weakness, weird bodily sensations I can’t quite put my finger on. Indigestion, heart palpitations, dizzy. Blood sugar issues even.

When I am in the middle of my anxiety, I feel very alert, lots of energy, like I can do anything (physically that is). I start getting really anxious about my health, and have not tried medication for those reasons as well. Been to therapy, I understand all my thoughts too well unfortunately.

What changed? Why does my body not tolerate stress anymore? Why is it not used to it when I go through this everyday? And I always seem to crash afterwards or is it something else healthwise? I’m just.. anxious lol I’m actually slowly destroying myself with my own thoughts and by the time I’m 35 I’ll be a goner

"My current battle with Anxiety and depression, how i’m beginning to end it. Hi everyone, I hope yous are all doing well. All my live I have been riddled with anxiety and it really has had me in a chokehold for many, many years. The last 3 years of my life had been the darkest and it truly seems surreal I can look back on it and SEE it and am starting to understand it for what it is. It really had full control of me, my mind, my body, my thoughts, my voice and the choices I made. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and I’m starting to really see it and most importantly feel it. Medication and therapy did kickstart this for me and the most awful times turned into just about bearable but life still wasn’t enjoyable, it gave me that tiny bit of mental strength to begin questioning “what is happening? Why is this happening? Is this really me?”. These questions initially scared me and my mind was telling me all the wrong answers to them, trying to instil false reasoning like… Im just born this way or it’s because of what I’ve witnessed, how I’ve been treated, there’s nothing I can do I’m stuck like this and I’ve just gotta bear with it for however long till I meet my demise. This is all not true and I’m really starting to realise and believe all these reasons of “why am I like this” was all something in me that was bigger, stronger and something I was simply identifying with involuntarily. My mind had tricked me for years controlling my emotions, reactions what I think, how I see things and how I should represent myself, I just wasn’t the real me that I was tricked into believing. It took me a very long time to reach this point but there is a you that’s in there, it just needs to be accessed. A major factor in this turning in a more positive direction has been reading and talking to people who have unlocked their real ‘being’. A book I can massively thank and couldn’t suggest more is ‘The Power of Now’. Reading many posts on here I can whole heartedly relate to the many of people that are struggling with their own battle with anxiety and depression. I wanted to share this just in case it helps anyone like its begging to help me, I’ve still got a long way to go but I’ve finally started to get on a road that I’m moving down and wouldn’t wish any of what I’ve experienced on a soul in the world. I realised it was only me that can change this and no other intervention was just going to solve any of my problems. It starts with you. Thankyou for taking time to read and I hope you’re doing well!

"Does it ever get better ? I am a 20F and I'll turn 21 in 3 weeks. I have been pretty anxious for a few years now, but I knew how to manage it. I even studied abroad for 2 years when I was 17 and I loved this part of my life. When I came back home to pursue my studies, it felt a bit strange but I kept it together and had a pretty full social life. Then I turned 20 and my life became hell. First I started having insomnia, then I just started throwing up randomly and feeling nauseous all the time. My thoughts were eating me alive and I could not tell anyone about it. That's when my panic attacks started. It was almost everyday before going to uni. Nonetheless, my life was perfect on paper. I am a sociable and conventionally attractive woman who just graduated from my country's best university. So I kept pretending for a few months that everything was okay and started obsessing over fitness to the point where I lost a lot of weight. I felt palpitations continuously and could not eat without feeling like I was going to choke on my food. I would feel hot all the time and start sweating excessively, which never happened to me before. I was a complete mess and could not face my reflection in the mirror, but nobody knew. I spent the summer doing all these medical tests to find an answer, then I faced the truth last month and went to see a psychiatrist. I got diagnosed with GAD, PTSD and OCD. I take 100mg of sertraline everyday, it's been 4 weeks now. I don't know how I got there. I used to be a perfectionist and a true workaholic. I was not scared of anything and always felt like I was special. Now I just feel like a waste of potential and a burden. I am screwing everything's up and I am relying on medication to stay alive. If there was a magic pill to come back to who I was a few years ago I would take it, but I know that's not possible. I can't even go out or take public transportation without feeling threatened by others. I kinda figured out how I got there, people were harsh with me for years because they thought I ""could take it"". Well, turns out I can't anymore. The thing is, I don't know how to get out of that place, and it's killing me. It's such a pity for me to say that my physical appearance is the only thing I have left, and I keep thinking about how it will one day fade away and how lonely I'll be. Maybe it's the side effects of my medication making my anxiety worse for a while, but I really don't want to turn 21 with such little hope for the future. No one around me seems to understand what anxiety is really like, so I guess I wanted to reach out to people who might understand my situation or who have had similar experiences in the past. Is there any chance for me to get better ? Is there anything I can do besides taking pills and hoping for the best ? ",anxiety

"Responsibility Phobia Please be gentle - I know the following might sound ridiculous and pathetic.

I have started university but just the concept of the responsibility alone has seen me not sleep for days, relying on benzodiazepine use and waking up with a racing heart and gasping from stress-induced breathing pauses.

This then manifests as health anxiety. I believe it’s my minds way of making an elusive problem more tangible. I am in hell.

I am basically a recluse, and I have no friends and no direction, and I was hoping to give myself some direction by doing what I have always wanted to do via a university degree.

I used to work at a job that put immense pressure and responsibility on me alone, without providing sufficient training or support, enforcing up to 16hr shifts, and if things went wrong it was all on me.

This was three years ago. Since then, I have been unable to work, and I have battled immensely to find a new path.

I also went through psychological abuse throughout my childhood and currently, and I have a history of “Pure O OCD”.

I’ve always wanted to study at university, and I have always had a relevant interest, but I tend to get a lock on type thing, where I obsess and tear myself to pieces over the concepts of expectation and responsibility.

The paradox is that if I was mentally able to grapple with the course, it might change my life and provide direction and fulfilment.

I am shattered from no sleep, and I am angry with myself for being so weak and unable to see it for what it is, and take it day by day.

I feel as though I might have to postpone my degree until this rough patch eases (if it does).

"Recovery after breakdown Had a really awful depression relapse post US election results and after a few days I decided to scrape myself out of bed and do some chores and move my body. I currently live alone with my dog and truly love the solitude it provides. No I don’t have any friends because I struggle at maintaining relationships and I am perfectly okay with being alone. 

The problem lies when I have to leave my quiet safe environment and enter the busy bustling world where everyone  is in a hurry to be somewhere and have very little patience for others. The world quite literally feels unsafe (and by world I mean just everywhere OUTSIDE my apartment). 

It requires a lot of energy to remain calm in those moments where all I want to do is scream and run out of the grocery store. The grocery store; where to normal people is just another errand in their everlasting to do list. But me? The grocery store is a big deal and once I get home I celebrate going even if it requires taking the rest of the day to recover. 

I wish I could just be normal. I hate how much anxiety and depression has taken over my life.The recovery period after a breakdown sucks. I feel like half my brain is gone and everything is foggy and it’s hard to think, and requires extra effort to just do basic tasks.

"I need help with palpitations and anxiety I am 21 years old and I made a stupid mistake. I swallowed a 100mg Viagra pill for the sake of experimentation. At first, the symptoms that appeared to me were a headache and I started seeing blue and green colors and my heart started beating rapidly. The symptoms lasted for two hours and I did not ejaculate. At that moment, I had a scary feeling. I felt that the left side of my body started to tingle or feel like chills and I felt that my soul was coming out of my body. I do not know if this was a case of fainting or death or high blood pressure. I went to the hospital immediately. They measured my heart. I had palpitations and my blood pressure was high and they gave me heart palpitations pills. When I took them, I felt better, but the next day the heart palpitations returned and I became more anxious and afraid for no reason, especially when I went to sleep. I went to the cardiologist and he put a holter device on my body for a whole day and took a blood test and my vitamin D level was 8. I do not know if this was the reason. After that, the holter device was checked. My pulse was 164 beats when exerted and 43 beats when relaxed. Then he gave me pills.  For the heart, including vitamin D 50,000, I started taking pills and the situation was getting worse. The anxiety and fear increased for no reason, as well as depression, and I had a feeling that I was dying. I was crushed from the inside, and the thinking, fear, and obsessions increased. Then I stopped the medications that the doctor gave me, called (ivadin), except for vitamin D 50,000. I am still taking vitamin D. It has been 3 weeks since I took vitamin D weekly. During those days, I feel dizzy immediately after eating, and when I go to sleep, my heart rate slows to 55, and I have shortness of breath and a feeling of fainting.

"Therapists validating anxiety/intrusive thoughts Hiya,

I've been through a fair amount of therapists throughout my life and I haven't been able to find a therapist or style that fully clicks. I saw a comment on /r/AskReddit the other day about having OCD and ensuring therapists do not validate the anxieties/thoughts from OCD. 

I was thinking about this and I recall a therapist I had several years ago. I told her that I had some anxiety about eating in a restaurant alone, especially sitting in a booth and seeing the empty chair across from me. She told me that if it were her, she would have booked it out of the restaurant immediately. 

I think her goal was to validate my feelings about being nervous but reflecting on this, I have not been able to eat alone since then. What she said affirmed in my mind that my anxieties about eating alone were justified. 

I can't recall too many other examples but I've seen a couple of other therapists after her and I must have shared similar anxieties about other situations. 

I don't want this to say I am pointing the blame at these therapists, these anxieties are my own and my own to deal with. But I do wonder if these therapists have worsened these fears? If they were maybe at a 5/10 on the anxiety scale, talking to these therapists and having these fears justified bumped them to a 7/10. 

I apologize for the wall of text. I've just never been able to really reap benefits from therapy and I'm starting to wonder if I need to seek out a therapist specialized in OCD just based off that /r/AskReddit comment.

"How to feel euphoric without things getting too risky? I started taking Prozac about 5 months ago, and Buspirone two months ago. At the moment, I’m prescribed 30mg of Prozac, and 7.5mg of Buspirone. 

I recently bought tickets to a EDM show, fully expecting to partake in party supplements. I’ve done MDMA once (before being prescribed anti-depressants) and it was magical. I’ve always had a really hard time loosening up and getting out of my head in large groups, so it was such a transformative experience for me.

After doing some research though, I’ve realized that now that I’m taking these meds, rolling might be either a dull or risky experience. I know the combo of Prozac and Buspar already has a super low chance of serotonin syndrome, so the idea of taking MDMA or something like it is tripping me out even more. My meds haven’t exactly helped me in the category of loosening up in big groups, so I’m worried that I’ll be in my head the whole time and not have fun.

"I don’t know how to relax and it’s burning me out  Title says it all, pretty much. I don’t know how to relax. I work remotely Monday-Friday 8-5. After work I have to clean, cook, shower, etc to stay busy. On the weekends, I feel pressured to get up and make the most of my days/time. I feel like I have to spend my weekends running errands, cleaning, shopping, going places, etc. By the time Sunday night rolls around, I feel exhausted and anxious for the week ahead - and often wish I had an extra day just to “relax” and stay in bed, even though I KNOW if I did have an extra day, I would wanna spend it doing things! 

I feel guilty and anxious and sad if I’m not being productive. If I lay around too much I start feeling like a bum and like I need to get up and do something. I really wish I knew how to relax and allow my body time to recover. 

Anyone else deal with this and have any tips on how you learned to let yourself relax?!",anxiety
"Rain makes my anxiety much worse. It’s very rainy in my country these days. It’s been raining the whole week. 
For some reason, the rain, even when it’s mild, always made me afraid and extremely uncomfortable.

"Need Advice | Appetite!  During certain social situations (most of which are unpredictable) I lose the ability to eat food entirely, any attempt to do so makes me incredibly nauseous and can even lead to vomiting. Sometimes, when I'm on holiday or in certain situations with friends I would starve for long periods, as regardless of how hungry I am I cannot eat, only surviving off liquids.

So far, this symptom has been impossible to manage. Breathing techniques, diet changes, and even propranolol have had little effect. I've been on Sertraline for a couple of months now and it hasn't significantly improved my conditions. 

I was just wondering if anyone else is experiencing the same issue as me and what they are doing to resolve it. I've been stuck in this situation for 2 years and it makes life really difficult.

"Eye ! Question  Why does putting pressure on your eyes (leaning on them as an example) cause your eyes to go blurry? I notice if I lean on one of my eyes then try to focus my vision on my nose! It’s fuzzy. 

If I cover one of my eyes it’s fine, no problem but if I put pressure on one of my eyes, then squint with the remaining eye or try to look at my nose with one eye covered, that after a while my vision can go abit fuzzy/grainy/static/blurry! 

Don’t ask me how I discovered this haha I think it must have been whilst sleeping and reaching for my phone to check the time, I sleep on my side with my head deep in the pillow and had one eye closed pressed against the pillow and one eye squinting for bright light and was looking at my phone and noticed my vision was grainy/ static/ fuzzy until I removed the pressure from my eye and stopped squinting ! Since then I’ve attempted it whilst putting pressure on my eye and using my other eye to try to stare at my nose. 

Any other time, eye is completely fine ! Just got me curious and I’m interested. Eyes are crazy ",anxiety
"Seeking Advice: Managing Xanax Withdrawal, Anxiety, and Building a Healthy Routine 
Hey everyone,

I’m going through a rough patch and could really use some advice from people who’ve been through something similar. I’ve been dealing with generalized anxiety and, for the past week or so, found myself relying pretty heavily on Xanax (6-10 mg daily). Unfortunately, I ran out yesterday, and since I’m on a work assignment at a mine with no access to medical help, I’m going cold turkey. I’d really appreciate any advice on managing this situation, especially if anyone’s done a sudden stop with benzos.

My Plan for the Next Few Days:

I’ve done some quick research and put together a plan to help manage the symptoms. I’m trying to keep things simple and manageable. Here’s what I’m doing:

	•	Basic Supplements:
	•	Vitamin B Complex in the morning (to support the nervous system).
	•	Vitamin C in the morning (helps with stress).
	•	Magnesium in the evening to help with sleep.
	•	Ashwagandha (KSM-66):
	•	Morning dose with breakfast for anxiety.
	•	Optional evening dose to help me wind down at night if I need it.
	•	Daily Routine:
	•	I’m trying to stay active with a morning workout or light exercise to keep my mind occupied.
	•	At night, I’m focusing on relaxation with a bit of meditation and the magnesium.
	•	No alcohol, staying hydrated, and keeping meals simple.

I know this isn’t a magic fix, but I’m hoping these small steps will keep me grounded.

Looking for Tips & Experiences:

If anyone’s gone through something similar, I’d love to hear what helped you. Any tips for handling the anxiety and insomnia, or just staying steady? I’m looking forward to getting past this, but it’s tough right now. Thanks in advance to anyone who can share their insights.",anxiety

"Afraid I have some horrible disease? I used to smoke weed and drink caffeine and eat sugar before bed every night and started dealing with headaches and high blood pressure. However lately, have had severe anxiety recently and have been at the ER multiple times with panic attacks after a first initial intense panic attack. Since then I've had a lot of physical symptoms and issues, tension headache for weeks, dizziness, lack of coordination, short term memory issues and other things. Lately I've had a couple issues I've been concerned about. When I text now, I text fast but now I mistype a lot of words with my fingers and also I have twitching all over my body which I've dealt with before but lately it's been intense. Also today I have fatigue in my left thigh but all muscles seem fatigued super easily and I keep dealing with tingling in my legs. I also wake up and don't get enough sleep because Im so nervous. I've started taking citelopram for a week and it's not doing much other than cutting off the panic attacks. I've lost 20 pounds and haven't been eating like I should so I'm not sure if that's what it is.

Just wondering if anyone out there is like me and  uses music to calm down during an episode. I've had panic disorder for a long time and sometimes attacks come out of nowhere.

"Feeling like a failure I have struggled with anxiety since I was a teen. After having my son 5 years ago it has gotten exponentially worse. 2 years ago I admitted myself and had to quit my job because I was in a very dark place. During this time I was diagnosed with ocd/ ptsd/ panic disorder. I am medication resistant and so I have done three rounds of TMS in the last year and half. 

I have mild anxiety here and there for the last year but for some reason this last two months have been unbearable. I tried to find a therapist and I finally did but my appt isn’t until 3 weeks from now. I just finished another round of TMS that did nothing for me this time. I’ve been having panic attacks nightly that wake me out of my sleep. I was sick with bronchitis for 4 weeks and called off a couple times. And I had to call off today because I just couldn’t make myself go to work with my anxiety being as bad as it is. 

Currently in the ER to see if I can get some help idek what kindof help they can give me. I am scared I’m going to lose my job. But honestly I think I need some time because I can’t take care of myself or my son properly . After I admitted myself I thought going back to school and getting a job in career I love would give me some kind of fulfillment and it did for a while but now I feel like I’m back to where I was two years ago. I feel like a burden on my family and I feel like I will never be able to live a normal life. I’m struggling so hard . 

I’ve been on 10 different medications and as last result my dr was going to put me on klonpin?? For when I have severe panic attacks. But then she randomly quit and the new psych I had refused to do this and wanted to put me on an antipsychotic which I refused because of the way I’ve reacted to basically every ssri/ snri/ mood stabilizers etc. the only thing I haven’t tried that I’ve done research on on Remeron, gabapentin, and benzodiazepines.

"Going back on sertraline after years  I used to take sertraline for anxiety/panic disorder for 2-3 years.
Initially during the first 4-6 weeks everything got worse which is common but after that it changed my life completely. I didn’t have a single panic attack, I talked to people, I was adventurous and my IBS even went into remission. 

When I went for a refill one time, the doctor (I’ve never met before) told me that I’d been on it too long and I should be fine, there’s no reason for me to be depressed/anxious. So I slowly weaned myself off. For about a year I was ok, then I started to notice things coming back. 

Now 2-3 years on I’m suffering terribly from spontaneous panic attacks, I don’t want to go anywhere, I’m scared of germs, of food, of ridiculous things. My IBS is back in its full glory. I’m constantly thinking whenever I go out I’m going to have my next panic attack. 

Last night I had 4 panic attacks in a row and I just decided that’s it. I’m going to go back on sertraline. 

I’m worried about the initial side effects as I have to go on a plane and take an exam in the next few weeks.

"Tight/pressure/burning feeling in hands and feet… 29 (F). Currently diagnosed with Endometriosis, very mild ulcerative colitis, GERD, anxiety/depression disorder, somatic symptom disorder. Not sure what to make of this. So I’ve had most tests done. Lots of blood work, MRIs, CT scans, X rays, heart checked, etc. Recently my left foot started to feel pressure on top of it and the muscle tight feeling spread to my calf…. ( out of the blue with no injury sustained) This feeling has been on going for a week. Then my toes started to burn. That feeling would spread to my whole foot then subside. Family doctor couldn’t find anything wrong, she told me to see a foot doctor if the issue persisted. (Can’t see foot doc cause they’re super full) In the meantime I kept my left foot elevated and iced it as she recommended. Nothing has really helped. My mind kept wandering to the thought of having a DVT. I’ve been trying to let it go. Then the same feeling spread to my other leg. (This feeling in my legs seems worst at rest then when I’m moving around) Now my freaking hands feel tight/pressure/tingling and they just hurt and it doesn’t stop. I feel as if it all calms down a little when I’m distracted, but it just comes right back. It was my entire left arm the other day. Very tight and painful. Now both my hands feel like I have been over using them. Very tight and uncomfortable upon waking up. I’m at my wits end and I’m tired of doctors visits only to be looked at like I’m crazy…. I don’t want to do anything cause of the on going issues… I want to feel better, but I don’t know what to do. Anytime I try to improve myself I feel worst in the end. I’m scared all the time.

"Do I have emetophobia? Hi everyone, I would really appreciate if you could read or skim this and help me out a bit.

The past couple of years have been rough on my mental health and I couldn’t figure out the cause. 

It all started when I had a bad hangover for the first time ever (mind you I never really drank so it was new to me) as I was on a train. I felt like I had to throw up for 2 hours straight, and there was nothing I could do about it. I was panicking and my anxiety was to the roof. 

A few days later I started having random panic attacks and I would start shaking and every time I tried to think of something happy or positive, it just didn’t work. So now I was depressed because of that, I mean nothing really brought me the same joy as it did before.

Fast forward a bit and it started to get kind of better, I didn’t drink or do anything to make me feel like I did on the train.

It’s been 1.5 years since the train and things have been all right (not terrible but not the same level of happiness before). All until I threw up, and this was not because of alcohol. 

Exactly one month ago from writing this post, I went to the gym and went past my limits and I also ate some granola and potentially expired milk, I don’t remember. All I remember is the horrifying feeling of “oh god im gonna throw up” and it you just knew there was no stopping it. The uncomfortable feeling of choking while my stomach acid is burning in addition to the severe panic made me almost faint. I had to slowly lay flat on the ground to calm down.

Now within the month after this happened, I have felt so mentally low with many panic attacks where I shake uncontrollably and essentially don’t see a clear future as bad as that sounds. I mean if this is what life is going to be then what is the point.

I am constantly doing everything in my power to not ever feeling like I did a month ago, because that was hell.

I am scared nothing will work to help this but I want to be back to my normal self. I was so happy and enjoyed life, and now I can’t enjoy anything without worrying. 

To conclude this, from anyone’s experience, do I have emetophobia? And whether I do or not, can this get better to the point where I can enjoy life again?

Additional notes: I am currently seeing a psychiatrist but he doesn’t know about this whole throwing up thing yet, and I will not ever consider suicide, but I would give anything in the world to make this better.",anxiety
"What it means to sit with our anxiety, my take Hi everyone, been lurking this sub for a bit. Like many of you I found this sub while looking for answers, guidance, and support. I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, it is something that started years ago for me. I went through an experience that I didn’t think was traumatic at the time but over time became the focus of my anxiety. I was able to live a pretty normal life though, but suddenly this year it began to seep into my day to day life and activities. Don’t know what caused it but it scared me, enough that I finally decided to do something about it and so I began the journey of learning about anxiety and how to truly address it. 

I have found many good resources over the last several months that have really helped me to understand anxiety a bit better and to develop a plan for tackling it. As many resources suggest I am choosing to face my anxiety which entails exposing myself to anxiety inducing things/places/events and sitting with and through the discomfort. I did not understand what it meant to sit with the discomfort, I understood the words but I just didn’t know how it would actually work. I tried it anyway and slowly but surely I think I kinda got it, but I wasn’t sure. I still couldn’t explain it or conceptualize it. Then it came to me while trying to explain to my wife and I think it may be helpful for others.

Think about a time you ate something spicy, remember how it slowly build up until your mouth felt like it was on fire. Remember that no matter how much water you drank it provided little relief. All you could do was pant and sit there wishing it stop. It was uncomfortable. But soon it enough you felt it subside, still burned but definitely peaked and was coming down. Eventually you would just go back to normal. Now the next time you eat something spicy you know what feeling awaits you. If you are like me you kept eating spicy and eventually you built a tolerance. You still felt the tingling in your mouth but now you kinda enjoy it. Food didn’t taste the same without it.

The feeling of anxiety can be overwhelming but it just that, a feeling, just like when your mouth is on fire. You sit with it letting it burn but it will peak and will begin to subside. It’s terribly uncomfortable but again just a feeling. I have noticed an improvement since I started this plan of exposure. What helped me too was realizing that the world was feeding me spicy food (metaphorically) regardless if I wanted it or not, so I decided that if I was going to eat spicy that I better learn how to use it to my advantage and learn to sit with it to build my tolerance. Hope this helps someone make sense of what it means to sit with anxiety like it did me. 

EDIT: If it was not clear, the spicy food reference is an example/metaphor for understanding what sitting with anxiety can feel like in terms of emtions, feelings, and sensations. Eating spicy food will not help cure anxiety nor have I ever seen any scientific source say as such.",anxiety

"Rabies anxiety  I’m sure we’ve all had it at some point - rabies anxiety. Such a weird thing to be overly anxious about since it’s so rare but I’m one of those people that obsesses a little with it and I need some comfort. 

Yesterday on a walk, a loose chihuahua mix cornered me and bit my leg. Their house was nearby as I saw the owners outside calling them and the dogs ran back. I went to the house and asked the couple for rabies paperwork. They were an older couple and said they are their dogs but their daughter takes care of all of that. They contact daughter who has the vet send her their rabies info and she sends it to me.

The date on the paperwork is 11/6/2023. Granted, the bite happened on 11/7/2024. My question was is the paperwork date the expiry or the date given? So I call the vet.

The vet says yes, it expired 11/6/2024. One day before the bite. If you want to get technical, like 10 hours before the bite. So I verify, “okay, so he got a one year rabies vaccine?”
Vet says “no, he got a 3 year, but we always recommend a one year.” (I’m in Texas just fyi) 

I ask “so if we are going to be technical, based on what you just said, the dog is current on his rabies vaccine?” And she says yes. 

So why is my anxiety still up in arms? The dogs rabies was “expired” for ONE DAY. 10 HOURS. I know in my head rabies vaccines just don’t go poof and they are just severely susceptible. Even so, if the dog had bit me 11 hours before and it was current, how much of a difference would that have made? Does anyone see where I’m going with this?

I literally only have $200 in my bank account. I need to save at least $1,900 by the end of the month to pay the mortgage and HOA. I only make about $800 every two weeks from my usual job after health insurance and taxes. On top of that, I have to take multiple days off a month because of severe anxiety. I supplement my income with freelance work online, but sometimes I only have enough work to make $100 a week. Then Christmas is coming up, and I have to save around $400 for that just to get my family decent gifts and bring a few dishes to upcoming parties. Then 5 family birthdays are coming up from now until early January so that's around $20 minimum per gift for money I really don't have.

Ugh, I'm just so overwhelmed. I get anxious about my finances, then I get so sick from anxiety that I have to call into work. It's a huge endless cycle. :(",anxiety
"I'm so anxious about visiting the guy I'm seeing I am going on a trip next week to visit the guy I am seeing. He lives in a different city from me and we've been talking for some time about me coming to stay with him for a week. I finally booked the tickets and was so excited at first, but now I have an overwhelming feeling of anxiety. I think I'm worried that he will suddenly disconnect or turn cold or abusive (there's no evidence of this so far in our relationship, but I am a survivor of abuse so I imagine it's residue from my past experience). My therapist advised me to have a back up plan in case I need to leave, and I have one in place. I just want to enjoy myself and have a nice trip but I can't figure out how to stop this anxiety.

"Anxiety  I've been diagnosed with anxiety back in 2017 and have been on multiple meds and some work for awhile then it gets bad again, I finally saw a therapist and she said even though she's no dr she thinks I don't need meds I need to alter my lifestyle. I also seen two physiatrist who only do med management and both want me on meds. I don't have constant anxiety I can go 6-7 months without ever having a panick attack but when I get overwhelmed and stress I have one really bad month where I get panick attacks frequently and then it starts to die down about 3 weeks for having the attacks. I stopped my old meds per the psychiatrist request because they were prescribed by my pcp, they were antidepressants and I have no signs of depression. And I've been off meds for two weeks and I feel better and haven't had any anxiety in 3 weeks. So do I really need to be on meds daily if they doesn't happen daily. The second psychiatrist who I preferred over the first had better knowledge and understanding even though she only does med management. I asked her will I need to be on meds forever she said no we need to treat it now and once we know the meds work we can go to an as needed basis but if I start meds now when I'm not having anxiety or panic attacks how will I know it's working. I'm just so up in the air about this. Any suggestions or comments are appreciated.",anxiety

"I've never been anywhere more scary than my local walmart Sorry, this might be a long post,, but I really need advice. I have had alot of anxiety issues about our walmart. Let me give some context-
I have always had anxiety over walmart ever since I was a little kid. When I was about 6, my grandma made my older cousin and I go to the back to get something, as we were walking, a man flew around one of those shorter square shelfs, and hit me with his buggy so hard that the corner of the shelf stabbed into my side, he ran away and didn't apologize as I was gushing blood out of my hip. I still have a scar from it. 
So now I'm 25- I still unfortunately have to go to the same exact walmart and I feel like it's only worse... 
-We live in a city of 35,000 people
-Walmart is the most affordable grocery store in town (besides HEB, I live in Texas, but HEB is in an even SMALLER building  than walmart, and twice as packed because of the good deals)
-this walmart not only has our whole towns population at times, it has everyone who is traveling the major state highway that is right in front of it, and people who are from smaller towns like 20 mins away. 
- we live in a retirement city, there are alot of older people on electric scooters and alot of families who come in together and it makes it really hard to get around. 
-everything is always out of stock and I feel like the grocery pickup has alot to do with it (and also contributes to the crowds when they push around their ginormous carts) 

When I turned 18- before pandemic times, I had no problem with shopping in the middle of the night because at least thats an option for people who don't like crowds. Now that walmart isn't 24 hours anymore, my best bet is going at 6am, which isn't possible anymore because my boyfriend and I are sharing a car and he gets off at prime time, 5:30 pm and unfortunately, he hates it as much as I do, so we end up sprinting out of there with barely anything.

 We have used the grocery pick up before, but it's really frustrating when we plan out a meal and it's out of stock and they replace it with something that doesn't work for our recipe, or they just entirely mess up or order, causing us to have to go inside to fix it. 

I'm not delusional when I say they are so busy, I've looked up reviews for our walmart and others say it's so crowded or the layout is bad. Please any advice that can help me get through this. A walmart shouldn't be making me want to pack everything and leave this town because it's my only option to shop at, but it is because it's affecting my everyday life and I'm tired of being hungry because I don't have the strength to push through in there. It feels like someone is constantly on top of me or in the way or about to hit me. Please help",anxiety
"Panic disorder, medication (and insight practice/nonduality) Hi all,

I've suffered from generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks and derealization for years. It comes in episodes, and I recently just went through one of the worst episodes of my life, lasting for a few weeks. I've never used medication before, but finally broke down and saw a psychiatrist during this recent episode and got prescribed some meds. 

The panic attacks are characterized by this intense feeling of being ""trapped inside of reality"". I have no way to describe it other than that. In the past I'd have a panic attack, but then be able to sort of get back to living life and forget about it. The problem during this most recent episode was that the idea of reality itself became a trigger - ""I am always inside reality, which means I am always trapped"". I know this may be incomprehensible to most people, but these thoughts and panic attacks induced real shifts in perception (derealization) where I perceive in my direct experience that I am literally trapped inside 3D space in the present moment. I am trapped inside experience itself. So for about 2 weeks I was in a state where I felt trapped like 24/7. Couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, constantly either panicking, in constant anxiety, or ruminating/obsessing over these thoughts and my direct experience of being a being/consciousness who is inside of experience. 

The psychiatrist prescribed me mirtazapine, prozac and propranolol. At this point I've had 6 nights of mirtazapine (15 mg) and today was my second morning of prozac (10 mg). I've taken propranolol only twice and don't plan to take it for daily use unless needed. 

3 days ago I felt okay, yesterday I felt decent for much of the day, and today I'm feeling ""normal"" in a way I haven't felt in a long time. Reality itself doesn't feel threatening, and the thought about ""being inside reality"" that was triggering panic is not doing so.

I should also add that I'm very into meditation, Buddhism and exploration of direct experience, so all during this episode I was practicing all kinds of insight practices to explore my experience and see how suffering was being created. At times it felt like there were minor epiphanies that led to a momentary release of suffering, but I kept finding myself back at that place of being ""trapped inside reality"". 

My questions:

1) I'd like to believe that my recent comedown was due to progress I'd made by studying my direct experience, but if I'm honest that is probably wishful thinking. It's probably the meds. But which one is working? As I said above, I've only been on mirtazapine for 6 days (nightly) and this is only my second morning of prozac. But today is the first day where I feel ""normal"". I don't feel high, I feel just completely grounded and normal. Could it be that the mirtazapine is helping, or maybe even the Prozac is already hitting on day 2? I've heard these meds can take weeks to take effect. To have something work on day 2 seems highly unlikely. Yet I feel so grounded and normal today. 

The following questions are more for those who are into meditation, spirituality, studying direct experience.

2) How do you reconcile your struggles with anxiety/panic disorders with your desire to walk the path? I'm left feeling a bit defeated - the states of suffering I went through were unbearable, even though I did my best to practice equanimity and acceptance. I feel defeated that I have to use medication and was unable to 'overcome' these states on my own. Further, I'm a big believer in studying direct experience to understand the truth of reality and how we create our suffering. Yet how can I reconcile the validity of studying direct experience with these states of strong derealization where I'm perceiving reality to be a certain way (i.e. that I am trapped)? During the episode I searched everywhere for a self who was trapped but couldn't find him. Yet it still felt like there was an ""I"" somewhere in experience who was trapped. 

3) Finally, how am I supposed to move forward with this knowledge I have? This knowledge that there is indeed some truth to the idea that I am a part of reality. In a way, that is true. Right now, it is not a threat. But clearly it has been/can be a trigger that can make my life miserable. And yet it's still true. I'm beginning therapy next week with a nondual therapist, and am hoping I can make some progress on my integration of this basic fact of life that I have been unable to integrate for over a decade and a half. Will I be forever dependent upon medication to keep me from panicking at this basic fact of life? 

4) Can anyone relate to this? This perception/trigger of being part of/inside of reality? I know it sounds bizarre, but it was my direct experience. Anyone else who is walking the path care to share their experience?",anxiety
"Is there any med out there that works as well as benzos? I don’t think there is.  I feel like I fucked up my brain by letting my doctor prescribe me benzos as a first type of med to try for my anxiety when I was only 16. I learned the hard way to not use benzos too often or for too long. The withdrawal I went through a few times in my life was borderline traumatic. I now use them only on occasion maybe once every two weeks but I wish I could be on it 24-7. 

I've tried and genuinely given a fair chance to: 

Gabapentin, Clonidine, Buspar, Hydroxyzine, OTC supplements, Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, etc. They either didn't work at all, gave me horrible side effects, or completely stopped working rather quickly. I'm still on Clonidine at the moment and have been for years but it really doesn't do much at all anymore.

"I need help badly My mind and body fail me every time. 

I don’t even know where to begin. My anxiety has gotten pretty bad lately. It acts up a lot at work. I work at a big restaurant with a lot of employees. I feel like there is a lot of pressure to be social, outgoing, and talkative. I also have a crush on one of the servers so I’ve been putting more pressure on myself to talk to her. My roommate knows about her so she’s egging me on too. 

Today it felt like my body was gonna shut down at any moment. It was like I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. My mind would not stop racing with thoughts. I tried to calm myself down, but I simply couldn’t. I couldn’t rationalize anything. I couldn’t simplify the way I was feeling. It felt like the weight of the world was on my shoulders tonight. I cannot understand why. 

Maybe it’s because everything feels like my fault. My shyness, awkwardness, avoidance, and anxiety is because I am doing something wrong. But I can’t figure out what it is. I don’t feel like any of this is by choice. It’s as if something possesses me when I’m around other people.

"Struggling with Anxiety for 6+ Years—Looking for Advice on How to Move Forward Hey Reddit,

I’ve been dealing with anxiety and agoraphobia for over six years now, and over the past three years, it’s gotten much harder to handle. I’ve made some progress here and there, but it always feels like something knocks me back, and I end up feeling stuck.

A little about me:

* I’m 24 and have struggled with anxiety since I was younger. It’s made daily things like leaving the house or talking to people tough. I’ve been working on it, but the progress doesn’t always stick, and it’s discouraging to feel like I’m back at square one after every setback.
* I live on my own and rely on HelloFresh and Amazon for food and essentials since I can’t go to the store. My family is nearby, but I feel like I’m a bit of a burden to them. They've been supportive, but I worry they’ve given up after so many years of me being stuck in this cycle.
* 3D modeling is something I really enjoy, and I’ve even sold 3D assets before and done some 2D art commissions, but confidence is a huge barrier for me. I struggle with promoting my services and setting fair prices, which makes it harder to make consistent money or grow. I love the work I do, but my anxiety makes it hard to stay motivated and to know where to start when it comes to marketing myself or finding new clients.

What I’m looking for is advice on how to move forward. I don’t know how to get a job or build qualifications, especially since I don’t have the money for courses. I also want to find a way to make enough money to stop relying on government aid, but I’m not sure how to break through. I just feel a bit aimless sometimes, especially with the anxiety holding me back from pushing myself forward.

What has helped you guys get through your anxiety?

If anyone has advice on overcoming this confidence struggle, or how to take small steps toward being more independent (both financially and emotionally), I’d really appreciate it. I just want to find a way to make progress and build something for myself, even if it’s slow.

"Panic attack while at therapy  So I’ve been seeing this therapist for about 4 or 5 weeks now, he is so knowledgeable and a brilliant therapist. I get very anxious about having a panic attack (which often brings it on) however I usually tell myself it will never actually happen. Today it did and it sucks.

My therapist helped me deal with it well, I like to be alone when I have a panic attack because I don’t like pressure from other people, he left me alone and helped to distract me. 

Half of me is glad this happened because now I’ve had my worst fear happen to me, and it wasn’t all that bad, I survived. The other half of me is now telling me I shouldn’t go back there, and I’m also really anxious for my next session incase the same thing happens again. 

I’m now left feeling empty and down for the rest of the day because of this panic attack.
Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with the aftermath of a panic attack? What do you do with yourself to feel better?

"I read a medical article—and passed out Fainting is a common experience. It seems that between a third and two-fifths of the population faint at least once during their lives. Some people’s lives are blighted by frequent fainting episodes. I’m lucky by comparison: I’ve only fainted once (and had one near-miss). It happened long ago. But it’s an incident that stands out in my life, because it came as a shock, and triggered painful emotions. So perhaps it may be worth recording here.

As a child and adolescent, I had strong tendencies to both squeamishness and health anxiety. I was particularly afraid of the idea of fainting. I thought it would be embarrassing, even humiliating to faint. There were certain experiences, I knew, that might trigger and reveal my sensitivities. I put up defences against them. I managed to give up studying biology before I had to do dissections. I avoided certain films, like The Exorcist, that were regarded as horrific: if people in the cinema were fainting, I would not be one of them. But I also didn’t want my mother to be aware of my sensitivity or of any trait that might be classed as weakness or unmanliness.

I got through to my eighteenth year without ever fainting, without ever coming close. And then it happened…

It was a quiet evening at home. I was sitting in an armchair, reading a magazine. My mother was sitting opposite.

I came to an article about heart attacks. There were interviews with celebrity victims, descriptions, diagrams. References to pains in the chest bulked large. I never finished the article. Part of the way through, I fainted.

At the time, I didn’t actually know what was going on. It was just that as I read my own sensations started to overwhelm me. I seemed to be experiencing what I was reading about. I felt a horrible pressure in my own chest, I broke into a sweat. Sleepiness, a nasty sickly kind of sleepiness  came over me, as if I’d been drugged. I couldn’t fight it; I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was frightened. I wondered if I was having a heart attack. I felt my eyes closing, against my will. I lost consciousness.

My eyes opened. I was still in my chair. Sweaty, weak, confused, still a bit frightened. The fear subsided: whatever had happened,  it seemed  to be over. I didn’t know I had lost consciousness; I thought that perhaps I had just closed my eyes for a second, like you do when you’re tired. But my mother was looking intently at me. She told me I had fainted.

I think I tried to deny it: surely I’d know if I’d fainted. But she was very clear that that’s what had happened.

Somehow it was worse to be told I had fainted than to realize it for myself. And the thought I had fainted in front of my mother was painful; it seemed to bring back childhood vulnerabilities. But that wasn’t all: she asked me why it had happened, and I had to confess that I’d been overcome by reading a medical article in a magazine. It seemed such a pathetic reason. I felt I had lost face. I was not simply embarrassed but ashamed of myself, as if the incident revealed a fundamental weakness. I suppose there must be some personality trait that caused me to faint when another person would not have done: squeamishness? high sensitivity? empathy? anxiety? I don’t know.  What I do know is that I became angry with myself, as if that would get rid of the feeling of shame.

Memory and forgetting are remarkable things. As time passed, and I acquired more experiences, I managed to forget what had happened. It didn’t seem to be connected with the rest of my life. The remembrance came back years later when I was waiting to be put to sleep for surgery and the doctor asked me, among other things, if I had ever fainted. At first I said no. Then I remembered…

As I said, this event stands out as an isolated episode in my life, and yet it also seems to be one of those experiences that reveal you to yourself. As I recall it now, I remember the intensity of the sensations I felt before losing consciousness and of the emotions I felt when I regained it. Except for the brief period of unconsciousness, I was in a way very much alive. That’s why in a way, though I hated it at the time, I’m grateful to have had this brief encounter with fainting. And I feel a kind of solidarity with other people who have had the experience. Whether you have or not, thank you if you have read this far.",anxiety

"Partner can't cope with my anxiety anymore  Hi all, I have struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I have tried various therapies and medications but never managed to find a good fit. 

My partner and I have been together for 7 years but he has now reached his breaking point. I don't think either of us realised how bad things had gotten. He is such a kind, loving soul and has always done everything in his power to support me and minimise the impacts of my anxiety. It has become routine for him to handle all of the day to day things I struggle with: phone calls, life admin, appointments, driving etc. I know he is constantly thinking of my triggers when we are in public and tries to avoid them. In the past year or so it has become worse and I no longer go out to social occasions with him or have friends of my own. If I'm honest, and I'm ashamed to admit this, he has become my whole world and I know it puts a lot of pressure on him. 

I have recently had a bad spell and been signed off work for a month. He no longer sees our relationship being sustainable and I completely understand. I am so desperate to change and we have talked at length about what would need to happen going forward for us to be together. My self confidence is so low and I'm scared I won't be able to. Has anyone been in similar positions to this and managed to improve things? I don't want to be the way I am at the moment - I feel like a shell of myself.

I am looking into private therapy, medication, reaching out to old friends, and I've been honest with my family about what is going on to try and build my support network. If anyone has any advice on what else I can do I would really appreciate it.

Neither of us want to give up on this relationship, we have built a whole life together and love eachother so much.

"Lyrica/Pregabalin Hello reddit,

I have been having intense panic attacks for 2 months now, and it got so bad I had to stop working. I went to psychiatric urgent care and got prescribed Lyrica. I should start with 25mg a day and up it every two days for 25mg, until I reach 150mg a day, then I should lower it again gradually.

Thing is, I have huge anxiety about this drug, because I've read so much about it. It's addictive, it causes weight gain, it makes your sleep horrible, ... the list goes on. 

I am still taking only 25mg, started on tuesday, and I'm incredibly scared to up the dose. In the beginning it made me feel calmer and happier, and I haven't had a panic attack since tuesday. Thing is, today I feel worse, I feel depressed, I cried again, and I'm scared that the 25mg won't be enough.

"Experiencing extreme anxiety and unable to study I'm facing one of the biggest challenges of my life with this upcoming exam, and the pressure is overwhelming. It’s a high-stakes test that could determine my future, and I’m already struggling to hold myself together.

 My anxiety has been relentless, leaving me emotionally drained and in constant fear of failing at something so important.

On top of that, I have to travel alone for ten hours just to take the exam, which only adds to my stress and makes everything feel even more daunting.

 I struggle with anxiety, especially with traveling alone, so I thought that having someone by my side might help me stay calm. 

Hoping for support, I asked my brother and sister to come with me, thinking they’d understand how much I needed them during such a difficult time.

But my brother’s response was harsh and dismissive—he misbehaved, making it clear he wasn’t interested in helping, and even suggested turning the trip into a vacation, with scenic stops I can't afford to take. 

His reaction felt like a dismissal of my needs, like he was trivializing something I find deeply overwhelming. All I wanted was reassurance, to feel supported by the people I trust, but instead, I felt alone and misunderstood. 

It’s disheartening to realize that, right when I needed support the most, I was left feeling abandoned, as if my struggles with anxiety weren’t worthy of anyone’s care or kindness.

"How can I support someone who refuses to face their anxiety? My husband is suffering from anxiety and has been for years (I suspect for even longer than I’ve known him) and it’s only getting worse and worse. 

He will admit he has anxiety in the midst of a panic attack but once it’s over he goes back to admitting he has it but refusing to do anything about it. His GP prescribed him medication but he has really bad health anxiety and has trouble taking advil or tums, never mind prescriptions.

I don’t want to push him, I want him to want to get better but I see the toll it’s taking on him and I’m really worried for his health. He focuses on exercise to feel better and often times will go to the gym and then cycle 100km in the same day, and when its raining or the gym is closed he has a lot of trouble dealing with that.  Exercise is healthy but this is beyond that.

How it’s hurting him is he is constantly worried about things getting done and being done right. He’ll spend hours finding the perfect $5 soap on amazon and then worry for days if it was the right one. I’ll find him up at 6am before work checking on the toilet to see if it’s leaking even though he tested it all day. I realize it doesn’t sound that bad on paper but he can’t have a conversation, sleep, or eat without worrying. 

I’m really worried for him and have found groups, scheduled counselling, tried to get him into relaxing hobbies, found him multiple meditation and self help workbooks and apps but none of these work unless he actually wants to get better.

"Why can’t I handle weed?? Whenever I get high and enter and social environment, I lose the ability to interact with others and make a complete idiot of myself. My jaw tightens up, I start speaking quietly and I lose all social skills (ex. speaking out of turn, lack of awareness of surroundings, etc.) It increases my insecurity so much and makes me not want to be around other people at all. 

Because of this, I prefer to only get high by myself or with 1-2 other people. When I get high, all I want to do is observe my own thoughts and just chill by myself and do my own thing. 

It’s just annoying because my friends say they become MORE social when they’re high, which I don’t understand at all. 

When I smoke with friends, they seem to act completely normal, like it isn’t affecting them as much as it is me. It’s not like they’re addicts or anything, they just seem to chill out more when they’re high. 

The only way I’ve been able to overcome it is by getting crossed, but obviously that isn’t very sustainable or practical for when I wanna smoke with others. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE getting high alone, but it would be nice to how to handle myself around others. Any advice??",anxiety

"Do my friends hate me or am I super paranoid? This is my first post ever on this account and I never have felt a need to post about anything. I just don’t know how to go about anything at this point I guess. So to give a little back story I (20 F) live with two girls from high school. I knew both of them separately one from freshman year and one from sophomore year. I introduced them to each other our junior year and everything was great till the summer before going to college. We all decided to live together to the school we were all going to during our senior year, but that summer before going to college both of them stopped talking to me. It really sent me in a spiral because I am very hyper emotional and care so much about everyone’s opinions all the time. So I talked to them trying to fix things before we moved and it helped but things just changed. I was really close with both of them in our own separate relationships but now it just kind of feels like they hate me. If I come home first and am in my room and they come home they won’t come say hi to me, but they do it to each other. They always are hanging out and never inviting me. If I walk into on of their rooms (they leave their doors open for the dog, I don’t because I’m an art student and I don’t want the dog to eat anything) they stop talking even though they were non stop talking before, I can hear them all the way from my room with the door closed. We did get into a argument last year about it and they said I was pushing them away and that it’s my fault. So I told them I’m sorry and that I would like them to just want to hang out with me and even though my door is closed it’s just because I don’t want the dog to choke on anything in my room or destroy anything in my room. I love that dog but I grew up with never having the dog in my room and I guess I’m just used to it. The dog also tears up anything squishy it can get its paws on. Building upon that, even if I’m in the living room and they come in they will just go to their own rooms and if the other one come home they will just like acknowledge my presence and go talk to the other. I always have to be the one to go to them first. It just feels like they don’t want anything to do with me. It’s also not just a trip thing because we have another friend who comes over everyday and she likes me but it’s obvious she prefers my roommates and it goes with all of our friends. They all have each other’s locations and not mine, and I feel like when I talk nobody cares, everyone just kind of looks away and doesn’t seem interested. I live with them because I can’t live by myself because I am super extrovert and when I’m by myself I go into a depression episode which last a while but even living with them and when I don’t make an effort to go an socialize, I’ll go into a spiral. There has been so many days where I have been sick or have a migraine and nobody checks on me, nobody texts me, I have to get up and just like make my presence known so I don’t go into a depression spiral. But if one of them are sick or have a migraine they are there for each other no matter what. I was literally in the ER (lung issues) the other day and I asked if they could bring me a blanket and like just a little snack because I was freezing and I hadn’t eaten at all that day. They all said they were busy and then when I called one of them about the dog when I got home, she said they were all in the car. I don’t know if it’s me issue am I just like hated? What did I do wrong? Am I to ugly? Because they are all really pretty and skinny and I’m not. Do I talk too much? Am I annoying? Also when we go out they always leave me and I never know where they go. So I end up like sitting by myself or dancing by myself. I’m trying not think they hate me because when I ask they are like no we don’t hate you and look at me like I’m crazy but then they do all of this and more that I haven’t explained on here and I would never do anything to a friend like leaving them by themselves at a party or not going to go seem them when they are sick. Don’t get me wrong I love doing things for people and I love getting things for people I just don’t understand if I’ve done something wrong, or if I’m crazy.

"Is it normal for the past to bother you more than the idea of the future? I’d like to say I do not have PTSD but I am extremely bothered by my past. 

Trying to recall virtually any memory brings me to tears either because (1) it’s sad or (2) I can’t recall it and that makes me sad. 

For example I was just thinking about my middle school experience and tried to recall and “play through” the memories as much as I could, only to cry and be frustrated with the fact I can’t remember shit. 

How could I have been alive all that time, all this time, and not even recall what it was like to sit in a certain class?? It’s only been 5 years! How can I not remember the teachers name I spent an entire year with? Why?

It’s like my mind tortures me thinking about my past and who I used to be and how things used to be, even though they weren’t even that much worse if not better. 

The future on the other hand I feel no negative emotions for - it is solely the past that brings me so much pain for no reason.

"GAD diagnosis - doesn’t feel accurate  Hey! I (F 30’s) received a GAD diagnosis today after receiving a multi appointment psych evaluation. 
I was primary seeking some insights and recommendations for a lot of neurodiverse symptoms I have which include: issues with mental focus on tasks, sensory issues, physical feelings of stress (migraines, GI issues, tension/restless muscles). 
For context, I’ve tried to get support for this before and the symptoms did not improve much with Wellbutrin, lexapro, or propranolol (I was taking this for migraines but as you may know it really ramps down anxiety). I’ve also taken stimulants short term and felt very calm and focused on them. 
The doctor ultimately gave me the GAD dx with the caveat that my anxiety is “atypical” because it’s more body based and that I have moderate sensory issues and moderate visual processing issues. They told me I could try therapy (have been doing for years), biofeedback for anxious thought patterns and focus (I don’t have a lot of anxious thoughts), sleeping better (I generally get 7+ hours of sleep per night, eating healthy/regularly (I already do this for migraines), try meds like ssri’s (I know there are many but am reluctant to try after having a bad experience on lexapro) and try mindfulness (I have been doing this for years and have a hard time keeping a consistent routine but practice yoga multiple times per week). She also said she would advocate for me taking non stimulant adhd meds??

It honestly left me feeling incredibly frustrated and like I’ve been diagnosed with hysteria or melancholia or some other historic “woman’s disease”. *Not because I think GAD isn’t legit, but because I feel my symptoms do not add up to it but they wanted to give me an answer. I’m not even sure I’d have adhd (maybe I don’t meet the diagnostic criteria for anything!). But this doesn’t feel right in my gut. 

So my question is- do any of you experience anxiety but have it more in your body than your mind?

Or anyone with advice/a similar experience?

Do you think this is a misdiagnosis?

Maybe I just need to learn more about different forms of anxiety?

Thanks so much!

"Health anxiety after a neighborhood cat bit me (lightly) Hi all, I struggle a lot with health anxiety. It's gotten better over the years but it's one of my most consistent struggles. 

The last week or so, a cute cat (slightly bigger than a kitten) has been showing up around my house. We've fed it a few times and it's very energetic, jumps in front of you while you're walking, is affectionate, etc. 

Seems like typical kitten behavior. Today as I was leaving the house in sandals, in addition to jumping ahead of me, it started pouncing towards my legs and at one point it seemed to playfully bite the back of my leg. 

The bite didn't break skin as far as I can see, but I'm getting a bit freaked out about potential rabies exposure. 

I know transmission from cats is basically unheard of these days and that kittens can be aggressive when playing, but I can't shake the fear that a rabid squirrel or something small could have bitten it at some point. 

I always figured if a small cat was attacked by a rabid animal, it would likely not survive, but I started panicking thinking about squirrels since a bite from one of those might not be fatal. 

Trying to calm down but it's been a hard week at work and life so this just compounds the anxiety I'm feeling. I'm torn because I really, really don't want to get a rabies vaccine if it's not a serious possibility, especially given how kittens can act. But I also don't want to be foolish by dismissing potential risk. ",anxiety

"Anxious that my friend might be distancing herself I’ll start off with some background info. I work night shifts at hotels and have a friend that does the same. We used to talk on the phone pretty much every night, and on our free weeks (7-on-7-off schedule) we’d always meet up to have a meal and play some games & recently go to the gym.  
  
Our hotels are quite different. Mine is very peaceful, there’s pretty much nothing going on all night and I work alone. Hers can get very busy and hectic and she works with a colleague in reception as well as sometimes people in other positions, such as security guards.  

About a month or so ago she stopped calling and coupled with her being kind of short with her texts I started getting anxious. I don’t mind spending the nights by myself, but I started wondering if she has started to prefer to talk to other people instead of me, like the colleague she works with. I brought it up 2 weeks ago for the first time and said that maybe it’s just anxiety, but that I was wondering if I was getting replaced. She said something along the lines of “nah i’ve just been down and i don’t look at my phone much”. It wasn’t the most reassuring of texts, but I said okay and said that I’m here if there’s anything I can do to make her feel better. We ended up not meeting on the free week we had, which hasn’t happened in a while.  
  
The other day my anxiety started flaring back up and I wrote a long text to her explaining how my brain overanalyses things and reaches the worst possible conclusions and that I’m still worried/sorry if I’m being clingy. She, again, responded in a way that didn’t come off very reassuring and sort of cold. It was along the lines of “as I said, I’m not on my phone much and it’s been busy here and I’m too tired to meet. and I don’t know why we haven’t spoken on the phone, you haven’t called either”. I had already made it clear in my message that us not talking/meeting isn’t the issue, but rather that the sudden change worries me and I’m essentially just looking for some reassurance that my anxieties are unfounded. But I replied, since she brought it up, that part of why I haven’t called her myself is because of the above mentioned differences between our hotels a.k.a. I assumed she was too busy, but also primarily it was because I’ve been anxious that she doesn’t want to talk to me + that the way her writing has read to me made me feel like I might be an annoyance. She responded with “yeah idk what to tell you, maybe my messages have been a bit short, but if you are worried about bothering with your calls you could’ve texted and asked”.  
  
I don’t know why, but I felt really upset by this. I had already been brought to tears by these worries earlier and I was just hoping for some reassuring words. I wrote back a somewhat snappy response saying “well i was hoping you might tell me i’m mistaken and that you still like me and want me around instead of being cold. […] sorry i even brought this up”. I know I typed it out or hurt feelings, but I felt frustrated because one day when I’d been quiet and distant and she ended up feeling anxious and worrying our friendship was ending (even though it wasn’t at all and i told her as much as soon as i found out), she spoke to me rather harshly and gave me a hard time because of how my silence made her feel. But now that I’ve been clear that I’ve been worrying for a month about a similar thing she can’t even reassure me and has as of now soon not replied in two whole days. I don’t know what to do. I’m even more anxious now thinking I was right and that she will end our friendship..   ",anxiety

"Weird rush in head So I found this post from 3 years ago that explains it quite well so I’m going to copy and paste it:

Not looking for medical advice just wondering has anyone else experienced this weird scary sensation? Comes on randomly or during an anxious moment. I describe it as a head rush. It’s like as if you stood up really quickly but it happens at rest so sitting, lying down and when standing or walking. When this happens it either feels like that, or a sinking sensation in my head and I feel kind of woozy after it it’s kinda like a mild faint and I also get a fright so I get an adrenaline type feeling in my chest or stomach. Sometimes I get a hot flash. I’ve had this sensation for so long I think maybe nearly 2 years or since the start of last year but I started getting it constantly maybe last autumn.

I want to add: mine kinda makes me pause like it’s short circuiting and it’s always one of my temples then I kinda loose hearing. It lasts like 2 seconds. Sometimes it triggers me to have an anxiety attack and shoots to my chest cause that’s what happens when I get anxious. Please tell me I’m not alone in these weird head rushes! I have muscle spasms too but I don’t freak out over those cause I get those everywhere. My PC keeps saying it’s all anxiety but how do I know it’s not something as severe as a brain tumor. ",anxiety

I got an infection that required surgery over the summer and then a month later I started to get dizzy all the time, and it’s all just been going downhill from there with an insane acceleration over the past week. A month ago I got really nauseous out of nowhere with no explanation (very emetophobic. this was a huge deal.) and I stopped going to classes and started spending my days on the couch, but about a week ago it got so bad I had to come home from school because I just couldn’t take care of myself and again, I wasn’t going to class.

"Need reassurance  So Monday night I was having sort of a mental breakdown like depression kind and it flipped 180 quickly. I took a big rip of my weed cart and it induced a panic attack bad enough to feel cold sweat and scream uncontrollably. I was stuttering and felt like I was gonna faint. 

I go to the Er and they drew my blood *they never sent it to the lab, I saw it sitting there with my name labeled,when I was leaving :(* they took forever while I was having waves of anxiety before giving me a Xanax. It helped and I went home but the whole night was wave after wave of panic. The next next I think I'm fine and smoke again *bad idea* I was fine until I start having waves and waves at night. Going into cold sweat and feeling faint. 

The next day I wake up panicking and go to a psych hospital twice. The first time they sent me home cause I was able to stop my anxiety on my own in the lobby and gave me venlafaxine. I took the venlafaxine and took a nap, woke up on fire and vibrating so I went back. I calmed down a bit and they gave sent me a prescription for hydroxyzine. When I left , I started again took the hydroxyzine as soon as I picked it up. 

It barley helped and I've been having waves of panic and cold sweat since yesterday. It stopped for a while a few times today and I managed to nap for 1 hour after taking a hydroxyzine again at 2pm. I woke up at 3 and I'm still getting waves of cold sweat and my neck feels tight. 

They did a EKG yesterday so I assume that if they said I'm fine, then I'm fine. 

I'm just scared of the weird chest pain I'm starting to have and the fact that the panic will not stop. It comes every 30 minutes or even 15. I can't stop it for more than 30 minutes at most if im lucky. 

I'm posting mostly to get this off my chest and hopefully someone will have advice to help me feel better.  

I know feeling numb, pins and needle is normal for panic. But the chest pain and feeling like passing out scares me. I tried to eat but felt like passing out and had to stop twice. I gave up and put my food away.

"My health has been terrible recently and i've been worried about dying for the past week. I (18 M) have been struggling with health problems for the past month and a half. Which was mainly because I caught an amoeba in my stomache and because of the exams I had coming up. I've been going to doctors over and over again and each time They assign a different medicine for me. Until recently (around two weeks ago) it got to the point where Im just suffering every time i try to sleep. Because my conditions keep getting worse specifically when im tryig to sleep. And for these past 2 weeks every day felt like it could have been my last.

But then I always end up falling asleep and worrying about tomorrow instead.

My parents as well as many doctors claim that the biggest cause of all this is my mental health due to the pressure that I had from the exams. As well as my severe anxiety at night from my symptoms worsening. They've been telling me that I should stop stressing so much as it only makes things worse. But never in my life was I so terrified... these past 2 weeks has been nothing but suffering. Each night being different than the other in terms of which kind of sickness im feeling.
Sometimes its stomachaches, sometimes its dizziness, fever, nausea, and now im struggling with heart palpitations and problems specifically with my head. Like confusion and disorientation. As well as a bit of numbness on my face and head.

Now im obviously not asking for a diagnosis. Though I would appreciate it if any of you could tell me about a subreddit that I could use for asking for healt concerns. As going to the doctors every other day just for closure is expensive and googling my symptoms will not be very convenient.

But for now all I want to do here is get this out of my system. Right now it is almost 4 AM and im unable to sleep because im worried of dying in my sleep like every other day i had for the past 2 weeks... if this isn't pure anxiety i have no idea what is...

Also this is my first time on this subreddit so im sorry if I used it in a wrong way somehow.

"On handling working with anxiety I am 22, and for the last year I have struggled with handling any tasks, whether it’s maintaining a job or maintaining success at school. To cooking, walking our dog, cleaning and washing clothes. The thought of it all fills me with anxiety.

I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I am prescribed duloxetine and was just prescribed buspar. I have gone to therapy for the last four years going on to five.

I’ve attended some college. Only worked customer service. And I’m first generation living in a single parent household.

Although I have in the past found my own successes, it has been incredibly difficult to maintain any of it. Currently I get panic attacks and acid reflux just from my anxiety alone. The worst part of it is that I can barely support myself emotionally and financially, yet I’m expected to provide for my family as well. I haven’t any issues with this, if I had a stable job I’d be able to do just fine. But how can I find a stable job when my own stability is at question. 

Financially I’m a mess, I have several thousands in debt with credit cards and I don’t have any income to pay bills. 

Every time I’ve been hired by a job, they have mentioned an issue with my ‘consistency’ and it’s almost become a bad word in my head. I come in eager to learn and work hard, and once it comes to a certain task or a certain behavior that I perform not at their expectations I get in my head severely and desire to just give up and quit.

I guess I’m just coming to you because I’d like to hear from people who have experienced similar situations. Anything is appreciated :)",anxiety

Not diabetes, not cancer, doctors cannot find anything wrong but they do agree it sounds like anxiety (seems to go away when he's happy).

Has anyone have an idea if this sounds like a symptom of anxiety? He also gets very low sleep, has poor eating habits, and is overweight. We're trying to fix it but my mom is dying from ALS, so all the doctors appointments and stuff makes us eat crap while out.

"Scared I may have a brain tumor  I’m 27, since August I started experiencing odd pressure and dull ache on the left side of my head, mostly near my temple. It’s not persistent, comes and goes. Seems to be exacerbated by extreme lack of sleep and tiredness, but when that happens the pressure or pain will last for a couple days before it finally subsides. First time I experienced it in August was when I slept for only an hour and had to drive 12 hrs back home from Florida. Lasted for probably nearly a week. Then it happened again a couple weeks ago when I had only slept for three hours and had to get up early for a dentist appointment. And this week it happened again because I had a family emergency and had to go to the hospital and stayed up til 5am. Got back home and fell asleep for like 3 hours. But this was Sunday and since then I’ve been having headaches nearly everyday. 

I’m having a lot of anxiety about this I guess because my mom had passed away from a malignant brain tumor early this year and it happened so suddenly. And now I’m getting paranoid and googling symptoms and I’m getting nervous reading everything. My vision doesn’t seem to be affected nor my hearing, I don’t know if I have memory problems or not, I do get forgetful sometimes because I’ve been so stressed this year with my job and always running errands. I’m tired and fatigued allll the time no matter much sleep I try to get whenever I can. Sometimes the pressure or ache in my head will be worse in the morning and other times it stays the same all day. Sometimes I feel a little weak or light headed. 

I tried to make an appointment with my primary care doctor but he can’t even see me until January and I’m not willing to wait that long…. 

I’m hoping maybe it’s just extreme stress and anxiety causing all this because I know it can, and things have been extra rough this year with my mom passing and I’m still learning how to “adult” but still, I’m terrified thinking about this and the more I keep reading on google the more anxious I get. I just need reassurance for now guys… ",anxiety
Xanax question Which tablet strength is most commonly prescribed for panic attacks for someone who has never had a prescription for xanax before?,anxiety
"I just realised I have an insane anxiety about the way my teeth look, or how I look in general. What I also realised is that worrying about anxiety can devolve into a waste of time I've realized that I spent years of my life trying to fix my teeth, even though there was nothing there to be fixed. I worry about the way I look, smell, behave, even though that doesn't lead to any success. It is a weird obsession about being able to connect with other people, without realizing what it actually takes to communicate.

What I realized is the absolutely primary thing in communication is what you say. For my entire life my problem has been that the words I speak are completely different compared to the words I write over text, like in this very Reddit post. I've always wondered why my wishes I thought were never fulfilled. Today the reason is obvious to me because I never once spoke what I really wanted to say. I had this magical thinking that if I look perfect, people will like me, read my mind, do what I want. Is this narcissism? Maybe? My father is one, I might have copied some unhealthy behaviours.

If you are unable to speak what you want to say, you are unable to communicate. That is the realization I've had.

To come back to the fixing my teeth part: That is by far the worst obsession to have. It costs money, it leads to pain, it leads to nonsensical things I want to fix. And it takes lots, lots of time.

I realized the more I obsess about fixing my teeth, the unhappier my life will be. I am wasting so, so much time in regards to that, so much time that could be spend way better. Also, with what motivation exactyl? That my teeth look nice? My brother in Christ, teeth are for \*eating\*, we are animals. Sure nice teeth look good, I get that, but my teeth already \*do\* look good, what on earth is there to fix?

By the way I'm taking Sertraline now, and only now I see the absolute insanity that my obsessions and anxieties are. I like it, it makes me able to function. I doubt I will ever be able to live without antidepressants because I am a really, really, really anxious person without them. I noticed that with Sertraline, I am able to talk with other people as if I were texting them. Exactly what I wanted. Now I feel like I can connect with other people on an intellectual level and don't have to ""impress"" them with the way I look or whatever. What a ridiculous viewpoint. I'm not a male peacock trying to impress others with his feathers.

Time is finite on earth. That doesn't depress me. On the contrary. It motivates me to be happy, here, right now, and it makes me realise that if I continue listening to my anxieties, my obsessions, and I will be 70 years old and look back at my life, I will be utterly, utterly disappointed in what on earth I have done in my life.

The choice is yours, as I've realized. OCD is something you just have to stop. There is no other way around if as I've realized. It's frustrating, it's painfully hard. But you have to. Not even meds help with that; they enable you to see what obsessions are irrational and what not, and being able to resist compulsions. Meds help with a general feeling of anxiety, a main motivation for OCD as I've figured out.

I want to add that I've also realized that anxiety is a nice thing to have. It is a nice feeling to have when you have a weird feeling of anxiety and actually realist there is an actually valid reason for it. It is, however, not good when that spirals out of control into obsessions and compulsions, or worse, derealizations/depersonalizations as I've experienced in the past.

If you struggle to the point of anxiety where it starts to hinder your life, please seek out help. There is help out there, as I've realized. Your mind might be clouded by irrational fears like ""No one understands me. Everyone hates me"". I've experienced those thoughts in the past, too. It required an insane amount of willpower to push through this irrational construct of my mind. But eventually I did it, and it was absolutely worth it. There are ways. There is help out there. It might be hard to find. But it is out there. There are 8 billion people out there. Surely, someone will understand you, and is willing to help you.",anxiety
"Left work because of anxiety.  I am so embarrassed. I just left work early because my anxiety was so bad. First I called in to say I was going in late and once I got into the parking lot, I panicked so bad I immediately  started driving to make my way back home. Not safe to do that. I’m so sad. I pulled over and after crying I thought I could do it. So I made my way back. Of course I feel so nervous  going back in but I do it. Immediately once I enter the store I feel terrible.

I ended up booking a private consultation with an ENT to see if there were any treatment options. However, he didn’t even mention TMJ. He said some of my symptoms were concerning and sounded more related to neurological nerves. 

He’s referred me for a Brain and inner ear MRI. 

It’s not until the 25th of this month and all I can do now is sit and panic that I really do have a brain tumor or something really is actually wrong and that I’ve been right after all.

"Issues with friends who drink due to past trauma - how to stop the anxiety? Long story short, I have an alcoholic ex. Aside from violence, every problem you can imagine popped up with that. Gaslighting, stealing from me, hiding his habits, etc.

He's long since out of my life but the effects remain, as well as having had 2 family members pass due to alcohol addictions. 

When I drink with friends in real life, I'm all right, probably because I can see them and know that they're all right? And I drink maybe once or twice a month, if that.

My best friend, however, lives in the UK - I'm in America - and evidently they have wildly different drinking cultures over there. Every day she has at least one glass of wine, usually before/with dinner, though sometimes has more. Back in May she took a month long break after going on a binge that was VERY concerning. Maybe I haven't recovered from that either. But she took the break, supposedly, and was back to the usual habits. She hasn't drank that much or that heavily in one go since.

At the moment she's on vacation and has been drinking slightly more. I suggested she take today off maybe, which she agreed to do and said it was a good idea. But she forgot while out having dinner, and I was greeted with mild typos that just sent me instantly spiraling into a panic attack. I asked her to please take a few weeks or a month off because, to me, this amount and frequency of drinking doesn't seem healthy. She's also on Setraline (Zoloft) for depression - which I've told her numerous times before she's not meant to drink on *anyway*.

In the meantime, how do I combat this anxiety? I don't want to like, control her of course, but every few months I get a little more concerned that she never takes breaks, and I don't know if it's something I can be around long term. If anyone has any advice I would greatly appreciate it ;;",anxiety

"First panic attack? Advice greatly appreciated Hey guys, for context I am F in my late teens and I have had a couple anxiety disorder my whole life, mostly affective social interaction, it is quite severe. I also have family history of anxiety disorders and panic disorder (I do not have this one to my knowledge)

So for the past week I’ve been unwell with quite a bad flu, but I’ve returned to school despite feeling slightly under the weather. In class I started feeling a little bit dizzy, I thought nothing of it but I started to worry about it a little and it started to get worse, like I started thinking something was really wrong with my heart rate and my arms started going tingly. Anyway I asked to go home as I was feeling faint, after that I felt so much worse, at this point I was convinced that something was horribly wrong and that I was about to just drop and die, I thought I was having a heart attack, stroke and everything, I just kept checking my pulse and everything. I thought my flu gave me sepsis or something, I know it sounds so stupid but at the time I was so convinced. I also had this really really severe impending sense of doom. When I got home my parents who is a doctor checked my blood pressure and heart rate and just told me it’s slightly elevated and that I’m probably panicking. The symptoms lasted for about 10-15 more mins but I started to relax after they reassured me I wasn’t having a heart attack or whatever I was thinking. 

Anyway, where do I go from here? If this was a panic attack, what does this mean for  the future? Is this the start of something? Like will this be a reoccurring thing? Advice greatly appreciated (:",anxiety

I was stressed out and took the wrong medication on a week long trip. I had already been taking it a bit irregularly due to my OCD (I have a fear of medications and also severe health anxiety). I didn’t notice any difference and actually felt better, up until September 23rd or so where I noticed old ocd thoughts popping up. My doc then put me back on the Prozac (20mg). My anxiety was getting worse and worse by the day, my external stressors also weren’t helping (going through a lot of financial and marriage issues, also a lot of changes at work). I had my first panic attack in q very long time that made me have to stop in the middle of the road to calm down. It had been 4 years since I called 911 due to a panic attack, and I did so on October 23rd. EKG normal they sent me home. Didn’t sleep for 24 hours cause the anxiety wouldn’t stop. Went to the ER the next day at 4am for chest pain, now 48 hours no sleep. Doctor said I probably had a pinched nerve. The cycle kept going and my panic attacks were getting closer and closer to eachother. I woke up with extremely weak legs and arms, to this day it feels like I have sandbags on them. I have not been able to eat more than 2 protein shakes a day, constantly dry heaving. I feel and electric pulsing through my body, and my hands are constantly cramping. Went to the neurologist due to ALS fear and he basically laughed in my face (I get why) but did the EMG and other tests anyways and they came out negative. Still worrier it's too early to catch. 

my question is- could stopping the prozac in august still be causing all of these horrid symptoms even though i started back in October with an even higher dose? 

i am working very closely with my therapist and psychiatrist, would just like some support from folks who may have experienced this first hand. thank you. ",anxiety
"Panic attack of 30 seconds is possible ?  I'll explain to you that 1 year ago I had my first panic attack and 2-3 months of panic attacks followed and then suddenly nothing (I'm still anxious but I've managed to cure my anxiety and agoraphobia, I go out every day, etc.) but several times I felt that an attack was going to come on, then nothing came.

A while ago I was smoking a cigarette and I felt an attack coming on, rapid breathing, my heart was beating hard but not very quickly and above all a feeling of fear, I was happy to have one because I think that reliving it could help me get rid of my anxiety. But it stopped too.



So my question is is it possible to have small panic attacks lasting just 30 seconds?",anxiety
"Personal journey with withdrawals and anxiety  My personal journal/ journey with withdrawals and anxiety 

I didn’t worry about my health until last Monday when I had my heart rate spike, couldn’t breath, felt dizzy, and almost passed out. I had a history of smoking weed for a long time  and did a couple other drugs a long the way. Since that day I completely cut out weed and nicotine and would never consider doing other drugs. I got severely sick after the first couple of days, actual medical issues, after that cleared I’ve been having what I think is the worst anxiety and depression of my life. I don’t feel like myself in the slightest bit. I’ve been very worried about my heart, and when I start thinking about it seems to get way worse. I can sometimes feel my heartbeat throughout my whole body and seem to overthink way to much when it happens, I’ve also never had severe anxiety before. It’s about day 5 or 6 and I woke up at 12 ate than went back to bed, I never take naps or such but my body felt so depleted. It’s been a hour since I woke up and my thoughts are scrambled and seem to come in waves. I want to feel normal again but I’m not sure what normal is anymore. I plan on seeing a doctor tomorrow, mostly for my heart because that seems to cause a lot of anxiety to me at least I hope. I’m a 20 year old male and smoked and had nicotine for 6-7 years also go on and off of heavy drinking stages not anymore, but have and did the other drugs around 6-7 months on and off.

"My anxiety is suddenly so much worse because good things are happening to me and i hate it  Hi everyone. 
I've been struggling with anxiety for a year or 3 now, I've always been anxious but it's gotten so much worse in 2021. I have medication to help me sleep at night because my anxiety would keep me awake but even that doesn't seem to really work anymore... i was doing a lot better with my anxiety though, i had a fun summer vacation and school was going well. 
But i just got the news that i can move out soon, and suddenly I'm anxious about anything and everything. I have compulsions as well (those never really went away) and that got worse too. 
Now I'm laying in bed crying because i found a pen in my bag from a random hotel I've never heard of, it's probably my parents but I'm worried because of those ""glitch in the matrix"" videos. It scares the hell out of me. The thought that reality is different than we thought or that we live in a simulation literally makes me nauseous. 
I hate it so so so much, but i just don't know what to do. 
I have therapy but my therapist only offers 9 months of treatment due to high demand, and those 9 months are almost up...
Advice would be greatly appreciated

Edit: I'm also scared to move, I'm moving out into a home with 3 roommates, and it's sort of assisted living?

"Being afraid of Death  I have been dealing with this for about a good year now. The first time I had it was really bad and lasted for about almost two weeks and it faded when my little sister’s Guinea pig died. Here and there I would get really anxious but never stood for long. I recently moved away from home and got married and it came back. For the past two months I have had some issues going on and I am currently about two months later handling it with any health test I can take. Went to a clinic (they said nothing neurological was going one and did the basic check up, got a massage, chiropractor, checked for diabetes (since it , ER EKG clear, Er (2nd time)CT Scan clear (head and neck), getting my heart checked currently (wearing a heart monitor went on a run and they said my heart didn’t calm down but it was the first run in a long while), getting my thyroid checked (since it runs in the family), have to get my wisdom out (made that appointment hope that’s what’s causing all these daily tension headaches), saw my physician and she prescribed me Sertraline. I mentioned all my past stuff. Many of them have said I have anxiety or to see a therapist/ psychiatrist. I am afraid that I will die or am going to die. The Er was able to crack something out of me that they said I could be causing physical symptoms but like I can’t shake this feeling that I am going to die. I’m starting to see old faces since I have came home and that scares me and my head issue I have has been coming and going (which I sincerely hope it’s my wisdom). The heart doctor prescribe me pills I don’t want to take but them calling freaked me out that something is wrong but I don’t get my echo until next week.

"How do you recover from a bad period of anxiety? Back in last December due to medical reasons I experienced my first really bad panic attack in years, and it spiraled me into not being able to eat, sleep, or even leave my room. I would have daily panic attacks. It slowly got better over time with the help of new medication and therapy. Since around April, it has slowly gotten more manageable. I had quit my job and dropped out of college though. 

Now I am generally better (not great though) but I am terrified to get a job again, or even take more than a few classes (I go to local community college). I am on a terrible schedule with no real motivation. This obviously makes my anxiety worse and brings back the panic attacks if I don’t get out and distract myself during the day.

"Anxiety induced sweating Ive read quite a few threads with quite a few people who have the same issue as me. Whenever in a public setting, class, or one which induces anxiety, I start to sweat like I’m running a marathon, and for absolutely no reason. Half of the time I don’t even feel like my body’s warming up, just sweat like crazy (armpit areas mostly) 

I have never had this problem until the past year or so since I started university. I used to sweat a lot but never for a non-physical reason. I even go on 2-3 mile walks daily and that doesn’t even get a drop of sweat.  My social interaction has went down a lot and I don’t see people as often as I used to. I think that’s what started my anxiety but either way, all of the suggestions on how to fix it either have something to do with anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medication.

"Managing Post-COVID Health Anxiety Hey everyone 👋🏽25M here. I caught COVID for what I believe was the third time at the end of August and recovered rather quickly, after about 1.5 weeks. I felt good for the first half of September but had a major depressive/anxiety episode at the end of the month. My mind was racing after believing I had a blood clot and while I’ve gotten much better and began Prozac at the end of last week to manage my anxiety, I’ve still struggled with intrusive thoughts related to health anxiety. I’ve read about some complications even younger people have gotten after multiple COVID infections and I’ve gotten anxiety about having blood clots, strokes or developing some underlying cardiovascular issue. I’ve had blood work done, an ultra sound of my heart and worn a Holter monitor for 5 days and I’ve come back fine. 

Does anyone have any advice for combatting these fears about developing some serious health issue after COVID? I feel my mind routinely being preoccupied with thoughts of pain and illness and it’s caused me to zone out and dissociate from my daily life frequently. Never in my life did I struggle with feeling so frail and weak but that’s how I’ve felt since late September. I just wanna get back to how I used to be.",anxiety

"Had to report a coworker and now worried  I had to report my co worker today. We work with small children (babies really) and the way she speaks to them is very upsetting. Check my post history if you’re interested in the story. I considered doing it anonymously but decided it was better to do so in person so they could ask questions and get the full story. Things started happening immediately. They promised everything would be confidential but I am soooo worried it’s going to come back to me. I was in the office for awhile this morning discussing it but they told them we were going of certifications. I trust my team better than to treat me differently if they find out but they’ve been watching her treat the kids like this for awhile so my faith is a little shaken there. It might also come down on my lead teacher because she has failed to do anything about it or report it. 

I’m also worried that if this teacher finds out it was me, she would throw me under the bus due to the mental health struggles I’ve had that we’ve spoken lightly about. 

I feel bad because I might affect her livelihood but the kids come first. I think I did the right thing but I am sooooo freaking scared right now. Tensions are already so high today. My team was losing it and then they took that teacher out and put her in another room which probably helped with less yelling but also knocked us down a set of hands.

"flying tomorrow i fly from london to nyc and i am so so anxious. i hate flying; it’s much less about the plane crashing or coming into difficulties and wayyy more about feeling trapped, having a panic attack up there, feeling anxious, feeling nauseas, fainting, etc. 

last few years since the anxiety/panic got worse i’ve only done very short flights - 2 hrs max. this is the furthest i will have travelled.

it’s frustrating bc i do want to go. there are people there who id like to see, work opportunities down the line which rely on me being able to go there, etc. i’m paying money to go, but simultaneously i’m questioning it & wondering why i’m paying so much to put myself thru this.

frustratingly cannot eat when i’m anxious, which then means i’m more likely to faint/feel nauseous and just perpetuates the whole thing. i just got back from a work trip to ireland and i feel pretty fried. the idea of being stuck for 8 hrs — plus the 4.5 hrs before of trying to even get to the airport and being on time for check in — and dealing w immigration on the other side is making me twitchy. it should all be fine, i have my esta, but i’m just envisioning feeling so bad by then.

I have been dealing with depression on and off for my whole life basically, I have also dealt with anxiety, but I feel like being anxious is being my “normal” self, so I am not even sure what is treatable or if I am overreacting at this point. 

My doctor recommended I take Ativan (Lorazepam - 1gm) every time I feel anxious 

My mom is basically against any kind of medication, so I had to bring her to my therapist so that she could explain to her why antidepressants are not bad. But she gets super defensive every time I mention Ativan, she says it is addictive and it won’t help me

Thing is, I am struggling so much lately with the physical symptoms (besides the mental ones which is what I am just used to at this point). Every day I wake up feeling incredibly anxious, my mouth is dry all the time, my tongue is hurting from the dryness. I have this kind of pressure on my chest that makes me feel unable to properly breathe, I cannot take a deep breath or yawn. A few days ago I believe I experienced some kind of panic attack, all I could see was black, my heart was racing extremely fast, I felt like I was going to die. I usually experience all of this during the morning mostly, as I am unable to wake up

I feel tired all the time and I cannot do anything other than exist. I am not sure what am I anxious about, but I just need to stop feeling like this. I don’t have other physical symptoms.

"Coffee and heart rate? So I started drinking decaf coffee and reduced my nicotine intake as well due to high Heart rate, but ever since then my heart has went crazy. Last night I smoked alittle thc and after an hour my heart went from 82bpm to 152bpm. I thought I needed to go to the ER but it finally chilled. Could this be the coffee or is my heart out of rhythm from the reduction of nicotine? ",anxiety
"Looking for recommendations for books on anxiety beyond work/ perfectionism related anxiety  I listen to a lot of audiobooks on anxiety while doing chores around the house as it really helps me feel like I’m at least working on my mental health and gives me hope that it can approve.. however if I listen to one more book that’s meant to help my anxiety and all the author mentions is exam or work anxiety or anxiety around perfectionism I might finally snap 🤪

While these are all very valid reasons to feel anxiety , I fear mine is more in the realm of “everyone I love has or will die and I can’t stop ruminating on how I won’t be able to cope with it and I might actually drop dead from the stress of how emotionally exhausting life is ” kind of anxiety and I’m having a hard time finding anyone talking about that in a book. 

So I come to you, as you’ve all helped me many times before.. have you come across anything helpful that’s more targeted towards heavier things? Learning acceptance and not obsessing over things that haven’t happened yet etc. I appreciate it so much!

"Chances of cat rabies? I've been taking care of a kitten that was born under my house for about 6 months. His name is Barney, he's very talkative and loves to be picked up and held. He's not my cat (we can't have cats in my house) but he stays around my house. I live in a city where there is a lot of stray kitties. 

Anyways, I have pretty bad health anixety. And barney was kneading my skin and accidently put the tip of his nail in my skin through my pants. It scared me. I am worried about rabies. I talked to my counselor, she said she used to work in the ER and she has never seen a case of rabies with cats. Or even heard of it. She said it's extremely rare, especially for cities. 

He is still eating, playing, and is still very loving but I'm afraid to hold him now and give him love because of my paranoia. I feel so bad but idk what to do. When he sees me, he runs up to me with his tail up and he meows non-stop until I pick him up, then he just purrs and kneads me. 

I came outside to say hi and he was sleeping, when he woke up he was talking a little and he hissed. He didn't seem aggressive though. No body language that indicated he was mad. Right after he hissed, he came up to me with his tail up and started meowing. It just scared me. I know he's a stray cat. So maybe he was just communicating? Or he was mad I woke him up. 
He's not aggressive or anything. He loves to be held and babied. I just scared myself when he hissed.

Again he is still eating and everything.  I don't see any changes in his behavior. 

I didn't even consider rabies until last night, I was on tiktok and I saw a video of a 6yr old who got rabies from a cat licking her wounds? I went to the profile of the page and it seemed fake, but it REALLY got to me. 

Someone please knock some sense into me. I love cats so much but this paranoia is making me scared to even pet him. ",anxiety
"I Feel Like I Can't Do Things For Myself Not sure if this is the right place for this. When I was young I had pretty bad behavioral/emotional control problems (bad ADHD) that left me pretty isolated from my peers.  I also had complicated issues with accomplishment and self worth stemming from family issues.  My family was great they just are all very smart and successful and I'm pretty average.  I'm now almost 30 and I still have this built in obsessive thing where my whole personallity is shaped around wanting people to like/be impressed by me and being terrified that if I'm not everything everyone wants me to be they'll leave and I'll be alone.  I'm so jealous of people who just are THEMSELVES, when I can't seem to form any sort of identity or personal integrity.  Everywhere I go I over analyze every single thing that I do and constantly feel like I look or act strange to other people.  Anyone have experience with this and maybe advice on how to move past it?

"Ever have a flare-up out of nowhere? Hey guys,

Long-term anxiety haver here (10+ years. Diagnosed with GAD, MDD, and OCD). I just got back into therapy because I noticed that my health anxiety had recently crawled back up. I had been body checking like crazy and experiencing all of my hallmark anxiety symptoms (chest pain, muscle soreness, stomach issues, etc), so I decided to schedule an appointment.

The session went great but last night I had a really bad anxiety attack out of nowhere. Maybe it came from mentioning trauma and triggers to my therapist? Anyway, I struggled to sleep but eventually made it to bed around 3am.

Today I just feel… anxious and exhausted. I had coffee with a friend and I felt like I could barely get it down without being nauseous. Have you guys ever experienced a flare-up?

Any advice, stories, or just supportive replies are much appreciated. 🤍",anxiety

"Scared bc therapist wants to put me on anxiety meds pls help :( I don’t have a lot of knowledge on psych meds and how they work. 

I’m only 18 and recently diagnosed with complex ptsd and anxiety, I started having physical symptoms and panic attacks a little after my dad moved back into my house (which I live at half the week to take care of him when my mother has work because he’s mentally and physically disabled) 

Long story short my dad is one of my stressors for sure but I love him and forgive him for the previous years that he put our family through. 

Since I have these physical symptoms my therapist wants to put me on medication but I have two opposing views on this at home from both of my parents and it’s only further worsening my anxiety over the thought of getting on medication.

My Dad has been taking lexapro and Wellbutrin because he has the same disorders as I do. He says that they’re safe and worth it.

My mom whilst sitting right beside him will say that they can make my mental illnesses worse and that basically I’m fine without it.

Normally my mom is the biggest person I trust for advice but I don’t know about this one.

I can’t keep having panic attacks, especially because i don’t want to bring down the people around me/exhaust them. I can’t keep having episodes where I keep telling myself I’m going to die even though I know what’s going on.

Can someone please tell me what it’s like to take anxiety meds, if it’s worth it and if you feel safe/what do you think the safest option would be?",anxiety
False Brain Tumor I know a lot of people must have already posted about this but in my case i have been to the neuro and done my MRI. Immediately after my MRI i went to doctors office and he checked my MRI infront of me. During scrolling the images he found something and told me there is something which we need to find out and then he said let me wait for the final report from radiologist. He then called the radiologist infront of me and asked him to check my MRI and the radiologist told him that nope it's nothing as it's just appearing on one side and not the other (something like that) and then in final report the radiologist cleared me from everything. Now somehwere inside me i am not fully convinced my headache and neck pain is still there especially i feel the headache exactly at the point where doctor saw something. I don't know what to do in this situation. Getting another MRI is not possible insurance not going to approve it. I did went back to the same doctor and asked him are you sure there is nothing and he said yes if there was anything we would have done your another MRI. Please tell me what shall i do in this situation.,anxiety
"Comorbidities Survey [Moderator Approved] I have been looking into common comorbidities and think I have a bunch of things but feeling a bit gaslit as I try to get assessed/treated for any of it. It seems pretty common for doctors to say someone can't have Y and Z since they are both so rare and not connected, or it's probably X not Y since Y is so rare, or just random misinformation like people with EDS are skinny, etc.  And of course everything is blamed on Anxiety.

So out of curiosity I created a survey of things that seem to be common in the neurodivergent population (and/or ancillary populations like MCAS/POTS/EDS or mental health) and I would like to do some data analysis to find connections, dispel myths, etc.

I'm just rolling this out, so please let me know if you have any trouble or if you see anything that's problematic. Thanks!

"How to use CBT to deal with current changes in the USA. A politically neutral post. 1. Write down what you fear is going to happen. Be as specific as possible. E.g. I believe that X will do Y, to Z, in W specific way, and B specific thing will cause C, and it will happen on S date, etc. Just this step in itself can help, as writing something out, getting it out of your head, can sometimes show us that we're catastrophising.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gl9gbu/if_youre_super_anxious_about_the_events_yesterday/


2. Rate how confident you are, that what you believe will happen, will happen. E.g. from 0-100, select a number, with 0 = I don't think this will happen at all, to 100 = this is definitely going to happen. 


3. Write down what emotions are coming up. 


4. Rate the level of severity of emotion, from 0-100. 


5. Send it to yourself through an email to yourself so as you have a copy of it that's easy to find, with a record of the time, date, etc. 


6. When an anxious thought about your prediction comes up, just use mindfulness, defusion, breathwork techniques, etc. and refocus your attention on building a world and life you value. 


7. If a new concern comes up, go through the same steps as here for it. 


This way, if you were right to be worried, you can enjoy the satisfaction of knowing you were right, and sharing this information with a friend who is of a different belief to you could provide a learning experience for them. However, if you end up being wrong, this can provide a great learning experience to reflect on how you were so confident about something that never ended up happening. Either way this facilitates objective insight and learning, provided through CBT.",anxiety

"Does anyone else feel like talk therapy has gone way downhill over the last 10+ years? Or is it just me? I feel like when I was in my early 20’s, therapy was a much different experience. Therapists seemed way better at their jobs than they do now. 

I would have sessions that seemed to be “threaded” together better.. we picked up where we left off.. therapists seemed better at digging deeper. Idk.

I’ve been noticing lately that those things are harder to come by. I have cycled through so many therapists over the last six years because I’ve noticed that we were just shooting the shit.

I’d open up about some pretty big things in previous sessions and in the following session, it’s like I never said it. 

I feel like I’m doing A LOT of work to start and steer the conversations and give them something to talk about. I get that in the beginning, I have to do that but after 3-4 sessions, meet me halfway!

Also.. I do WEEKLY sessions.

And yes, I am very upfront with therapists in the first session.. I explain what I’d like to work on specifically and what my pain points have been with therapy lately. 

Idk, it’s just really discouraging when I really want to do the work and build on my sessions but oftentimes I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall. 

I’m about five sessions in with my new therapist and she’s a hoot but she’s very unprofessional.. late, too chatty about her business and other peoples business, minding her phone during our sessions, and I’m prettyyyyy sure she’s a little high lol (not funny but wtf).

I’m gonna keep the faith and keep searching (I’ve tried different platforms, private practices, services through my employer, etc). 

Anyone else notice this lately??? Do you feel like therapy was a little more helpful and effective in the past?

TLDR: therapy has been shit lately. Can you relate?

"Rediscovered a huge trigger and idk what to do  I just need some help because idk how to begin working on this. 
I cuddle with my friends a lot, generally I’m the one that likes this the most so I’m always the one the asks them. Ik for some people it’s hard to reject someone directly like that and I’m terrible at picking up subtext and social cues so if someone says maybe in a bit, I can never tell if they’re being genuine or are using it as a way of gently saying no. Because if this I’ll often ask twice and if we are cuddling I’ll routinely ask if they’re ok or they want to move or something. 
Recently, I was cuddling with a friend and I was quite clingy. 
They later told me that they felt uncomfortable and just weren’t as up to it at the time. They also told me that it’s never been an issue before and not to worry about it. 

I have a huge fear or abandonment and the idea that I broke a boundary sent me spiralling and thinking they hated me. I feel like I did everything right, this is really common for us and i asked if they were comfortable several times. Ik both things can be true but im scared I didn’t do enough. I began ruminating on every other time we’d cuddled to try and figure out if they were lying about it never being an issue to make me feel better. 
This all gave me the worst panic attack I’ve ever had, I was vomiting, I couldn’t feel anything and I genuinely  thought my heart was going to pop. 
I talked to another friend about this and they also confirmed it wasn’t that big a deal and that I need to get some help for this. 

I’m scared to talk to the person properly now. I haven’t talked to them about this as I don’t want them to think my reaction is because they set a boundary and I don’t want to scare them off of setting boundaries when they need to. 
I’ve been kind of avoiding them out of fear that they think of me differently now, as if what I did was unforgivable. Im scared to bring it up again I’m case I’m dragging it or something. I just don’t know what to do. This has always been a major trigger for me, a few years ago I was scared to hug people out of fear of making them uncomfortable and I’ve come a long way through exposure therapy snd trying techniques I found on the internet. Now I feel like I’ve kinda been reset, I’m scared to go near them in case I accidentally brush up against them or something.

"PVCs worst, when i try to challenge them  Background: I have been dealing with health anxiety and cardiophobia for the past 6 months

Started with chest pains which sent my anxiety into overdrive, i went to the ER thinking I am having heart attack, they did ECG, troponin, chest CT with contrast, and chest xray and cleared me.

After that I followed up with my primary doctor and they cleared me as well after redoing ECG and blood test.

Then i struggled for months and the pain didnt become any better, I got worst pain in chest and shoulder and the got an MRI too for chest, nothing was found, I started getting dizziness, breathlessness, numbness in left hand and leg and Drs kept reassuring me that nothing was wrong and it’s probably anxiety.  I also got stress echo done for my heart and that was fine too 

I started reading anxiety books and doing meditation, I read the DARE book and started applying the principles.


Now the main story, from the past 4-5 days i have been not having any pain or breathlessness or dizziness or any other symptoms but i started getting PVCs, it started with 1 and then it continued during the whole day, I even caught one on my ECG app on apple watch, showed to my dr friend and he said they are mostly harmless

But today, I got it again, and i followed the DARE principle and said ok show me your worst PVCs that you can and it went downhill after it, i started getting more and more of them, it went crazy. i had to standup and go for walk and they calmed down. 
Now my anxiety is back at its peak that something is wrong with my heart.

"Is this normal? I feel helpless, don't know what to do  I'm 23f and have been on and off chronically sleep deprived for almost 5 years now. I went through a traumatic experience from the age of 19-21 and it really affected me mentally and pushed me knee deep into the world of anxiety and insomnia. From the ages of 19-21 I have spent almost every waking hour in anxiety, fear and suicidal ideation. Even in my sleep I used to be anxious and would be violently woken up from the overthinking and fears. 
When the external factors of trauma were over around the age of mid 21, I started really struggling with lightheadedness and overall fatigue, lightheadedness, abrupt heart rates, like it goes up whenever, like my body is in a constant state of stress or anxiety. There will be moments my head is so darn sleepy and IN THE MIDDLE OF SLEEP even my body is in a sleep state but my heart rate would just suddenly go up and every other part of body then has to follow abruptly. Even when I have a physically active day or I'm working out, it doesn't really help my sleep. 
I'm so desperate and feel so sick. 
It's affecting my daily life. My heart beat would go way up randomly, I feel a rush of blood to my head when I get up when I sit down sometimes when I'm just sitting, after heavy work outs or cardio I go mad lightheaded.

"Unable to stop anxiety, and unable to detect why it's happening. (to an extent) I have a few suspicions as to why I have such random anxiety every few days, ranging from ruminating about my past toxic relationship, family, and all that stuff. I can identify and recognize that I am anxious because of these things.

However, from time to time, let's say every few other days or so, I just have completely random moments where I get INTENSE waves of anxiety lasting anywhere from a couple of minutes to the entire day, not dissipating until the next morning at all, and I have absolutely no explanation for them. During such moments I am not thinking about anything anxiety-inducing. I could even be fully relaxed, having fun, or whatever, and STILL experience these debilitating random waves of anxiety.

What has worked in such situations have been benzodiazepines and weed but I don't want to rely on them for any longer than I should to calm down my anxiety.

I have tried multiple other things, such as changing my lifestyle, taking daily walks, and doing everything I can in my free time to relax and while it DOES work, there are just some days that I get a random wave of anxiety (light to absolutely devastating) and I cannot pinpoint why. Usually, I can deal with it, but sometimes it's so bad it leads me to take high doses of anxiety medication to calm me down.

I talked to the landlord about it he’s just like well it could possible be on you to fix it. I don’t have money for a plumber and I need to wash clothes but that’s where the issue is. Now I’m obsessing over this situation and it’s almost debilitating. Idk what to do about this feeling,anxiety
Propranolol I’ve seen a lot of people who have said it helps with physical symptoms which is a big issue of mine. More specifically I get short spasms/ tremors in my legs and arms which kinda starts my anxiety. Has anyone else taken it for this reason? My only concern is I have a normal bp and a low resting heart rate (60 bpm) so I really don’t wanna mess that up ,anxiety
"So freaking tired of feeling this way. I am at my wits end with myself. I have been extremely high stress for several months now. Back at the end of August, I worked myself up into an ocular migraine for the first time ever. Since then, I have been hyper focused on my vision and stressed about it. I’ve noticed floaters in my vision that I hadn’t paid attention to before. I work in an office for 12 hour days, staring at a computer in fluorescent lighting and I’ve started to see a lot of quick pin pricks/spots of light in my peripheral vision that make me completely spiral. It happens just about every day that I’m at work, but doesn’t happen as much at home. The fact that it’s every day, sometimes a few times a day really scares me. I’ve been to two eye doctors who say my eyes look perfect. The second eye doctor told me that stress and blood pressure could be causing it. But every time it happens it makes me panic and then I can’t stop thinking about what could be wrong with me. My doctor went ahead and referred me to a neurologist just in case, but my appt isn’t until February. I’m 28F btw. 

I’m so overwhelmed. I feel like I’m going crazy. I know I shouldn’t seek out reassurance but I just want to know if I’m normal or okay. Of course Google has the worst things possible that it could be.",anxiety
"what a strange brain  I have a very strange and uncommon mental issue that most people don’t face. It started when I was 12 years old in middle school, when my classmates and my brother’s classmates used to bully him because of his bad smell. I started focusing on personal hygiene, showering, and using deodorants. What happened was, as soon as I thought about going to school, I would find myself trying to stop sweating completely. But over time, the opposite would happen — I’d end up sweating intensely to the point where I would be in a pool of sweat, facing uncomfortable situations. As the days went by, it wasn’t just about sweating anymore; it extended to everything that went through my mind — obsessive, negative thoughts. I would get these thoughts and physical symptoms about everything I loved. For example, I loved playing PlayStation and competing with my brother to win, but I started getting thoughts that the moment I held the controller, my arm would hurt and become heated, which would happen every time. I’d sit down, and the thought that my nose would swell, enlarge, and become inflamed would trigger an immediate reaction, and my nose would inflame and turn red. Sometimes, from the severity of the pain, it would bleed. The thoughts I get are dynamic depending on the action I’m about to perform, whether it’s talking and interacting with someone, studying, playing sports, driving a car, watching a movie, reading a book — anything I do. This situation is extremely limiting and depressing. I’ve been to more than 25 doctors and therapists, practiced all kinds of cognitive behavioral therapy, and taken every psychiatric medication on Earth, but there has been no improvement or satisfactory result. Even up to this moment, I haven’t been able to get a proper diagnosis for my condition.

In short, my mind is capable of executing any intrusive, obsessive, or anxious thought, as long as this action is within my body’s range. For example, if I have the thought that I’m going to sweat right now, in seconds, I find myself trembling, my heart rate increases, and I sweat heavily as if I’m in a pool. If the thought comes about causing pain in my head and neck, in less than a second, my head and neck tense up, and so on in various aspects of life in a dynamic way depending on the activity I’m engaging in, whether I’m talking and interacting with people, working, exercising, or even eating and drinking. My mind is incredibly strange and evil to the utmost degree, and the worst part is that my nervous system cooperates with it constantly and carries out its commands.

"Is anxiety one BIG umbrella, or many small ones? I was thinking earlier how I have so many different types of anxiety. Social, career, driving, etc. 

That got me to thinking: would all of these be thought of as completely different in terms of focusing on and rectifying? Like one at a time slowly picking each apart? Or would it actually be much more effective to just focus on the topic of helping with my ""Anxiety"" as one big problem that needs solved all at once?

Maybe it doesn't make sense. But it just puzzles me how stuff like social anxiety and driving anxiety could be tied into eachother. It makes sense if you think about it long enough I suppose.

"can somebody explain the medical reasoning behind my symptoms during a panic attack? so i developed panic disorder in january, and have been having panic attacks almost every day since. this has caused me to develop agoraphobia and i'm only 20 years old. every few months, i have new symptoms unfortunately. i think its because i anticipate something to happen, so i start to actually feel it. anyways here are some symptoms i get:

1. hyperventilating or feeling like i cannot get a full breath in

2. pins and needles in my hands, feet, and sometimes legs and arms. feelings of numbness in these places as well (theyre not actually numb though if that makes sense. i can still feel pain and feel things when they touch me.) 

3. sharp or dull pain in my head. usually my temples. it only last a split second at a time or a few seconds and then goes away. usually only happenes at the peak of my panic attack

4. severe vertigo, especially if i jolt awake out of my sleep hyperventilating. i'll have vertigo the rest of the day or a few days later. 

5. hot flashes, feeling extremely hot as if i'm in the sun or i just ran a marathon.

6. ringing ears

7. my movements feel very odd. i don't know a good way to describe it, but i feel like i'm not aware that i'm moving? or that my movements are uncoordinated or don't make sense? like i feel out of body

8. severe derealization. i literally feel like i'm going insane 

9. this doesn't happen everytime i have a panic attack, but i'll get palpitations or elevated heart rate or both",anxiety

"Buspirone & Side Effects I’ve been taking Buspirone for almost a week now, starting with 2.5mg x 2 a day and have no upped to 3 x a day.

I didn't think I'd have any side effects on the first day but it's the only thing I can think that's causing it - I've never had this issue or feeling before.

"Panic attacks/PTSD Hey all

I’m a 39f who has been in EMS for 20 years. I have a pretty significant history of personal trauma as well. 
Anyway, I ignored it for years and in the last 2-3 months it’s caught up with me in a big way. 

I had to take a leave from my job. The good news is, I can focus on recovering. 

I’ve tried meds. They haven’t panned out so well for various reasons (SSRI and beta blockers) but I started CBT/EMDR a couple of weeks ago and I am already seeing improvement. 

But, I’m struggling with the whole ‘why can’t I do normal things’ frustration. I have panic attacks in stores, or just thinking about going back to work. Some days my anxiety is bad enough that I cannot even be productive around the house.  

It’s a long and slow process and I am feeling frustrated and defeated.  I feel as though I’m learning to walk again.  So many things I could do easily before are now a challenge. And I feel very broken because of it. 

I could use some pep talks and some success stories.  Especially with people who have chosen to go the no medicine route.

"When I think about getting help I wonder if I'm being dramatic I finished school in 2022 and I'm now 21. Halfway through my last year in school I would make up excuses as to why I couldn't or didn't have to ect. Since leaving I haven't done anything. I haven't gone out to see my friends since 2022 and when one of my friends came to me my hands shook the entire time and I felt a pit in my stomach along with feeling so hot I felt nauseous.

 I haven't been able to go to shop by myself or work and I know that my family thinks I'm lazy and that I ""want to stay at home for life"" as they put it but that's not it. I want to live my life and stop being like this but it feels like it's getting worse. Yes, I dont leave the house unless I'm going shopping with my mum but even that is hard for me. I do go with her to pick my brother up from school which used to be fine but now I have to take public transport starting tomorrow to get him to and from school due to car issues and I'm struggling just thinking about it.

We have enough money issues as it is and I cant afford to be like this anymore. I can't do anything and I feel stuck. It's effecting my life, I cant go shopping bymyself, use public transport, make or take phonecalls or even play games online without feeling horrible. It's gotten to the point where I'll bee fine and then my throat will feel tight at first and then it hurts and breathing is a struggle. I wouldn't call it a panic attack but i assume it's something similar to that?

I have enough symptoms to know it's anxiety or atleast that theres something wrong with me but I'm worried that if I do go to a doctor I'll be told that it's really just me being dramatic and to stop worrying.

I asked my cousin to point it out to my mum after sending her what's happening so I'm waiting for that to happen because I know I wouldn't be able to make an appointment myself but I'm terrified I'm making something bigger than it actually is. I've never been the type of person to cry infront if others or talk about my feelings good or bad and I'm scared of having to have that conversation. Growing up I was incredibly shy (even now) to the point where teachers would tell subs not to call on me and would have a teaching assistant constantly ask if I needed help but I'm not sure if that shyness developed inti anxiety or I'm just blowing me being shy out of proportion. I don't want to be like this

It might sound silly but I'm really just writing this because I want someone to tell me that I'm not being dramatic about it, but no matter how much I think about it it feels like I am.

"Feeling terrible after resigning  I’ve been at my current job for just over a year and work in a tight nit team of 4. I’ve been doing very well and achieving quite alot for myself in the business.

But I’ve recently made the decision to resign. It came as a huge shock to my boss - I’ve been feeling totally burnt out and exhausted. I wasn’t looking for it, but a new opportunity came up with better hours and better pay which I applied for and got. 

Through all of this, I’ve been struggling immensely with stress from some pretty huge life events. My boss was aware of this but didn’t offer me any resolve. She didn’t offer me reduced hours or time off to help with the stress.

With that, I decided to throw myself into work and started picking up and doing well in my job. But I didn’t realise it was just burning me out more. 

So, I met with my boss this morning before work and confessed that i was leaving - due to the stress and exhaustion - and that I’d found another job to suit my needs. 

Initially, she was just upset and felt for me. Then, she said they’d reduce my hours and give me some time off, and that this would have always been an option. I was slowly starting to come round to the idea but then she said something i didn’t agree with, and her attitude changed. 

She started saying “well if that’s going to make you happy then fine” and “if you’ve seen a better option and don’t want to try with us then fine” and it just felt like she was digging at me. 

I started over explaining why I was leaving and brought up an incident I had with another coworker which happened the year before. Which actually has nothing to do with me leaving. 

So, in the end my boss said to just put my notice in writing and then we would start my notice period. I’ve asked for some garden leave but she doesn’t think I’d be allowed. 


I now just feel terrible after the whole thing. I wish I could rewind and do it properly, but my head is all over the place. I have a long notice period to work, under stress anyway, and now with this added awkwardness. Any advice?? ",anxiety

"Actionable ways to survive work/education during a sudden increase in anxiety/panic Hi all, writing on here because I’m desperate. I [28/F] have suffered from panic attacks and anxiety on and off for 10 years, but for the last year or so I’ve been mostly fine. My only big anxiety triggers have been things like presentations, and even then it’s more “surface level” anxiety where it just feels like bad nerves.

I think all of us who experience chronic anxiety and panic attacks know the difference between “normal” anxiety and the hellish experience of a true, deep anxiety disorder. Today, I woke up feeling normal, and then about 2 hrs into my day randomly had a huge panic attack out of nowhere. This triggered a crazy feeling that I was going insane, that I wasn’t inside my body etc. it also triggered me to have severe stomach cramps, diarrhoea and dry heaving while being unable to eat. 

The problem is, I had work today and had to file an article for a deadline. Multiple people are off sick so I really couldn’t call in sick - plus, I already spoke to my boss (pre-panic attack) and agreed on the work to be done today etc so I didn’t feel like I could call her up and suddenly say I felt unwell. 

I am also studying alongside work and have some immovable deadlines which mean I will need to work over the weekend. Perhaps my high workload at the moment has triggered this anxiety episode - usually I thrive on being busy with work and studying, but I am aware that this could have driven my body to give out. I’ve been sleeping well, eating well (until today) and I exercise most days. 

I’m looking for advice on how to tackle the next few days while I wait for a doctor’s appointment to discuss possibly going on medication. I can’t cancel my deadlines or work - and I think that even if I could, it would be a bad idea to just lie on the sofa doing nothing all day. 

Do I get up early and go for a run tomorrow to try and prevent another panic attack in the day? Cold shower? Meditation? Any tips and advice would be much appreciated.

"Penguins helped.  

Hey guys. I’m sure a lot of y’all are feeling like I am this week. 

A lot of my anxiety hits at night and when I wake up. I have awful nightmares that seem to continue even after I wake up for a few mins. 

I always try to be a ‘casual observer’ of my physical symptoms and acknowledge it for what it is - flight or fight misfires - but it does not make them go away all the time. 

This morning I was laying in bed, recovering from a nightmare and I thought about penguins. I did everything I could in that moment to just see the little penguin guy walking in the snow. He stumbled but got back up.  He’s hella cute. 

Something as small as focusing on a penguin for a few mins let me get back to sleep. I still had anxiety but for a few moments it was easier to exist. 

Find your penguin. Also, I truly believe (like from the bottom depths of my heart) that we are gonna make it through this rough time. My husband and sisters aren’t as concerned as me (and they also don’t have severe anxiety) so I don’t really have anyone who gets it like I do.. but, if you do, I hope you find your penguins too, even just for today.

"My anxiety is becoming much worse after huge career switch and I’m scared I’m going to have a nervous breakdown  Hey guys. I’m 30 and have just started working retail for the first time .

I quit my career of over a decade ( Hairstylist) after many years of being treated poorly , labor violations in my salon, and abuse from my clients . I’m currently in school for a history degree and wanna teach when I get my masters. This retail position is temporary / transitional until I finish my degree. 

I basically applied to 1000x of jobs and landed a cashier/seasonal position. The training is non existent and I feel so thrown to the wind . I am a VERY hard worker but the lack of direction in what is wanted from me is making feel violently sick and anxious. The kids who have been training me think I’m a freak because I’m such a nervous energy . 

I go in later this evening and the anxiety is crippling me . I feel like a moron. It takes me longer than the normal  person to catch on with a job that’s so high paced. I see the 18 year old kids breezing through it and here I am, somebody who did customer service work for a decade, about to puke blood. 

My career in the salon was very fast moving and high energy but I also knew what was expected of me and coped. I was a junior manager and was very capable of running the business and managing a huge book of clients . 

I feel like I have NO idea what I’m doing and I’m so scared to make a mistake . 

I’m very blessed to live at home and have my moms support . I am privileged .  

I received a call about a dream job the other day as an instructor - but they only can offer me assistant positions and subbing 10 days a month. 

My mom said if I really can’t handle it I should just focus on the sub teacher position and forget the retail job. It would barely be enough money to live on and pay my bills but she said she wouldn’t care if it meant I could do the subbing and finish my degree in peace . 
 
I am sobbing as I write this because I feel so pathetic and crippled by anxiety.  I thought I had mostly conquered my anxiety issues and was just a nervous person. I never thought I would need to leave my career as a stylist so soon without being fully situated in a school system but things were unsafe at my old job and it was necessary I leave. 

I feel like an immense burden on my mother and I’m ashamed. She’s so amazing and raised me as a widow and I can’t even support her now. I’m 30 and I feel like I failed to thrive . A freaking seasonal retail job is making me sick with anxiety and I hate myself for it. 

I am so scared I will never adjust to being a self sufficient adult. I have always had anxiety issues and prior to this experience I always worked for a mom and pop salon . 

My greatest fear is I am so crippled by my mental state that I am unable to work and need to go through some sort of a disability process . I have a cousin that had a nervous break and went on disability . Her life is awful and I feel like I’m heading that route . She has no real income and lives with her mother in her 50s. I see myself in that. I don’t know how I can be so book smart and poorly equipped for dealing with life? I don’t understand it.  

I need to get back to a psychiatrist but I haven’t been able to find one under my plan . It’s too expensive out of pocket .I formerly did yeats of therapy which helped ease anxiety for me , and was briefly on anti-anxiety medication . I need to resume something to cope.

The month I’ve been out of work I was stressed and unable to relax. I left a really dangerous work situation but am now having to swallow down that choice. I don’t regret it but I don’t have that dependability and stability . The lack of income coming in was a real fire under me and I wasted no time applying . 

I have two jobs now ( the teaching job hasn’t officially started yet) and my retail.  

I just need to be heard so thank you guys . I know I am lucky to have been given my opportunities. I’m not ungrateful- I just can’t cope with the stress and the unknown and feel like a moron / ‘invalid’ of society.   ",anxiety

"Desperate for relief  Sorry this post may be a little long lol. Iv had anxiety for years which wasn’t high anxiety and managed just fine. Times that it was a bit higher I’d get DPDR which I hate that feeling and would take l theanine. But the last 2 days out of nowhere Iv had like severe anxiety and back to back like mini panic attacks. Iv never felt like this before and I just want to feel ok. I had a death in my family last month which triggered my anxiety a bit more and for like a week in the mornings I would wake up nauseous and heart racing but that’s went away and Iv been ok. I went to bed Tuesday night fine but when I started to drift off I woke up in a panic and that kept up the entire night and at one point my heart was racing so bad and my body was shaky. Yesterday I felt ok off and on but also panicky and doom feeling off and on. When it was time to go to bed last night I was already getting anxious because I was worried I wouldn’t be able to sleep which I didn’t sleep much but slightly better then the previous night. My DPDR has been super bad and I hate that and doesn’t help, I just feel like I’m gonna go crazy or something. I know high anxiety can make you feel like that but Iv never experienced this before, and then I scare myself that maybe it’s a heart attack or something wrong. Iv also been very irritable and angry but I know my time of the month is coming so that’s prob why, I also wonder if I could have PMDD because the anger before my period has been like that recently.

"I'm dangerously scared I may be losing myself, and I feel so alone I honestly don't know where to begin with this. I'm struggling badly to get out of bed, I don't feel like eating, talking, or even socialising with other people, including my own family. Even just the thought of doing these things are causing me to have extreme panic attacks to the point where I feel like I'm dying from a heart attack, or extreme blood pressure.

For a while now, I have struggled with anxiety and depression, have been in and out of therapy, on multiple medications, but I feel like I'm falling further down day by day. I haven't been able to sleep properly for at least 4 years now, at least not at night, and every time I wake up, I have a severe panic attack, which has caused me to feel scared about going to sleep, for fear of having to experience these horrible feelings again. Furthermore, this dysfunctional sleep schedule has caused problems between me and my family, who are starting to notice my issues, and getting frustrated over it, which is pressurising me even further to the point where my symptoms become more aggressive, which I feel is worsening my condition. I feel to scared to even come out of my room, let alone outside, and I can't think of a way out. I also feel that my lack of sleep (or rather proper nighttime sleep, as I often sleep during the day due to worrying all night) is gradually causing me to lose my mental stability and could kill me quite soon, from some illness or disease related to sleep deprivation, as if I didn't feel like I was dying enough already from anxiety alone. 

Another serious concern I have is that I won't be able to find, or keep a job in the future due to my debilitating symptoms, and therefore won't be able to afford a place of my own, or even basic needs such as food or heating. I'm really keen to move out, but not sure if it will ever be possible, due to mental health. On top of that, I'm beginning to feel like I'll never be able to do anything at this stage, not even engage in relaxing or fun activities such as going for walks, eating, or going out with friends. I'm afraid I may even end up homeless due to my illness, financial instability, and problems with my family, who understandably are feeling affected by my lack interaction, but I just can't bring myself to speak to others just now, and I feel pretty misunderstood. All of these difficulties are causing me to feel very alone, and even more ill from my physical symptoms, to the point where I become irreversibly psychotic. Is this likely to be the case in the long run? Has anyone else faced a similar experience? How can I cope with this mental hell?

"Anxiety and stomach issues A few months ago I started to have stomach issues (bad stomach pain and diarrhea). It wasn't that bad because I was still able to live my life. With time it got worse, and I started avoiding taking buses and instead taking the train because it has a toilet (even though I needed to walk 30 mins to the train station). But sometimes taking the train is not an option. Then, everytime I needed to leave the house and be somewhere in which there was not a toilet around I was anxious about it. Commuting, work (Sometimes I'm all by myself at the store and I can't leave to go to the toilet. It is also a very busy place and usually the line to go to the toilet is huge), road trips have been horrible. I started to feel my stomach hurting, and then I started to cold sweat and feel like I was going to pass out. I've been so dependent on Imodium, but it is not all the time that I'm prepared enough to take it before my stomach starts to hurt. Today I had an exam and right at the beginning I felt my stomach hurting, and then I had a mini panic attack. I asked one of the supervisors for help and she talked to me outside of the examination room until I calmed down. Then I went back and it started again. I tried to calm down and breath but my stomach was just not working. I go to the toilet and nothing happens. I finish the exam as quick as I can and go home. 

I had all types of tests done in the GP but no diagnosis. I'm trying to get help from a dietitian, and I'll do an IBS assessment. At first it started as stomach pain that gave me anxiety but now I don't even know what causes it anymore.

I had panic attacks another time I got sick years ago (anemia) and it took me 2 years to ""heal"" from it. The trauma from being sick gave me PTSD, which then resulted in depression and anxiety. It was just such a horrible time in my life, but it was during the pandemic. Now I have a life to live and adult responsibilities and I can't let it take over my life, but it has been incredibly hard.

It is incredibly debilitating, I don't go out anymore, I have to go to work, I avoid going places and just stay home. If I'm going somewhere with other people I rather just go by myself because I can leave the bus/train whenever I want. I only feel safe and calm in places which I know there is a toilet available.

"1.5 years of health anxiety, hair loss, fatigue, and throat issues - Am I just anxious or is something underlying? I'm a 26-year-old guy, and I've been dealing with health anxiety for 1.5 years now. Previously, I've been on 5-6 different antidepressants, but now I'm down to just one. However, I'm still constantly anxious and worried, always thinking about repercussions. and this health anxiety makes me believe I have some underlying condition or that someone will harm me.

Additionally, I've noticed some physical symptoms:

- Hair loss (not excessive, but when I pull my hair with my hands, 5-6 hairs come out each time)
- Fatigue and non-productivity throughout the day
- Roughness in my throat, needing to make noise from my gland to clear it

I've been trying to quit my antidepressant on my own. When I don't take it for three straight days, I feel my brain working really slow or pausing. When I look around, I feel something unusual, but when I take the medicine the next day, I feel okay.

Google hasn't helped. Researching my symptoms suggests various conditions, including thyroid issues. Reading more about thyroid problems has only convinced me that I have it, and it's saying some scary things.

I'm lost. Is this solely anxiety-driven or is there an underlying condition? I don't know what to do.

"extremely anxious about climate okay this all started around a week ago, and it made my life definitely worse. 

I've always been an anxious person, but now it feels almost like my mental walls all crumbled down at the same time and I can't do anything else other than worrying. it's November and it's not as cold as it should be, so the whole ""go out get some fresh air and sunlight"" is making things worse rather than better. 

I'm lucky I live in a walkable city with tons of nature and my uni is on the sustainable side, so it helps a bit. I'm attending lectures to distract myself and it kinda works sometimes, but I also have AuDHD and my attention span is not the best. autism is also worsening my anxiety, I'm empathetic by nature and seeing the state of the world right now is dragging me down. 

I'm sleeping in the same bed as my mother these days, and I dread the moment I'll go back home in the evening because there's nothing I can do without feeling helpless. 

also, I haven't showered in a week (but I wash my body parts separately everyday!) and my hair is a mess because spending 15 minutes in the shower without distractions is a big no-no. I look into the mirror and see a destroyed being.

"Doing really bad tonight I decided to go to sleep early tonight because I was up all night last night watching the election. I fell right asleep and it was wonderful. I woke up and thought I'd had a nice long night of sleep and checked the clock to see it said midnight. I drank some water and got comfortable, then it started. I hear loud bare knuckle knocking on my door. For reference, I live alone in a college apartment. But it echos through my whole place. Not overly fast or anything like a panic or someone trying to screw with me, just loud knocking. I immediately pause my sleep sounds and start hyperventilating, hoping they'd left. They knocked again, slower. I finally grab my glasses and creep to my door, open the peephole, and no-one is there. Not at my door, my neighbors, or in the hall I can see. They simply *disappeared*. Usually I can see down the hall a bit or hear movement, neither of those happened tonight. Only two of my friends know where my room is, but they'd always text first and I had no texts. I stood at my door shaking for a half an hour waiting to see ANYTHING through the peephole, nothing. My mind started racing. Was someone trying to scope out my apartment to rob me? Had someone found my vote? (I voted opposite to my very dominated state). Etc. I took apart my smart lock and pulled the batteries so no one can open it and effectively bricked it and barricaded myself in my room, but I still can't get back to sleep. Every noise is making me jump. I don't know what to do but I don't feel safe here.

I used to think it was just me being cutely flustered but it makes me feel restless and sad. 

I was never good looking, atleast until this year I suppose. A lot more people (especially women) compliment my looks, a complete turn around from the rest of my life. I don’t believe compliments, I still accept them and don’t push them away because I like hearing them. Even so I still get that anxious feeling. 

I don’t want to push her away because I love her support and how she cares for my well-being, but I want to be able to do that without crying in disbelief. I was in a relationship before her a few months prior to now with an avoidant person, after a couple months she seemed to distance herself which made me question my self worth.

I has a suspicion that it wasn't actually them and I reverse searched the image , which led me to the actual account of the person. Now, remembering thing has set me spiralling and I cant sleep most days. What is somone is using my face? What if some pedo is using my picture to attract younger people?

"displacement anxiety / health anxiety. I wanted to mention this because a lot of people deal with health anxiety but recently I noticed that my health anxiety is more of a displacement anxiety. There have been major anxiety inducing situations going on in my personal life recently and randomly when I am worked up about it I’ll start noticing symptoms that I have daily and will hyperfixate on them until I relax or ignore what has me anxious. My therapist mentioned that she also feels like it is displacement anxiety but I’m not one to have health anxiety on the regular, only when under pressure. 

Today I noticed the displacement anxiety going from being stressed over major events in my country lol to suddenly noticing that I’m getting chills and that I’m very close to getting a tension headache if I don’t relax.

"is this normal???  hello! im an 18 year old (F) and i think that i suffer from anxiety, which is very weird for me. 

my anxiety/panick attacks started in spring when i was going through an exhausting and stressful period of time (dance competitions, exams, theater, school) i barely had time for myself but that was normal for me. i usually know when these periods of time are about to come and its been this way for many many years now, but only this year i started having panick/anxiety attacks.

they started off at night the second i turned off the lights and went to bed i started feeling like i couldnt get enough air and how my heart starts racing. my mum could feel my heart racing aswell so we went to the doctor and told me that there s nothing wrong w my heart besides the fact that i have systolic murmur (idk if its called this way but its basically one of my valves doesnt close enough) its not a big deal, most people have it and it only causes the heart to beat faster for 2-3 seconds, nothing harmful tho. 
they gave me a natural med that makes me fall asleep faster and calms me down (its with melatonin, valerian and some vitamin) sometimes it works other times it doesnt. 

summer came by and i eventually got over these attacks i could still feel the sensation of not getting enough air but i didnt think much about it so it didnt develop into an attack until i literally forgot i had all these. 

in august i went for 10 days on vacation w my boyfriend and on the first night we ate some chocolate (right before bed) which made my heart GO CRAZY so when we turned  all the lights off i started shaking and twitching i vomited i went to the bathroom several times and i was in a full blown panic attack. it ended up w me doing respiration exercises w my boyfriend and then i js fell asleep. the other nights i was js scared to go to sleep but i took that natural med that made me fall asleep so it was all fine. 

a month ago i slept over my bf s house (it wasnt the first time, i had slept there many times) and it all went well until we turned off the lights and i started shaking and twitching again, i was freezing cold, i vomited again so while he went to make me a hot tea he gave me the task to choose 1 good tiktok out of 10 lmao, so i did that, i got under the blanket (like fully) and started watching tiktok which made me completely forget what ive been through, i wasnt cold anymore and eventually he came to bed and we both fell asleep. 

last week i went to greece and again, i was very tired on the first night so while i was waiting for my bf to get out of the shower i almost fell asleep (i cant sleep with lights on), the moment he came to bed and we turned the lights off i started shaking and twitching, i could feel anxiety and stress in my chest  and then after some time my heart started racing. we eventually called his parents. his dad gave me a med that was supposed to slow down your heart rate but i didnt take it knowing that i dont have real heart problems and then his mum came over the bed and started talking to me in general telling me stories and i eventually fell asleep with my heart racing, bpm didnt go down. 

days going by during the day i was very anxious about going to sleep so then again i could feel anxiety and stress all over my body and i was just very scared. at night i took again that med before going to sleep i was anxious but all i did was watch tiktok which made me forget everything and fell asleep. 

when i came back home sleeping and anxiety wanst a problem anymore. i really need help idk if all of this is normal and i want to solve this issue by myself i cant go to a specialist and if i tell my mum she ll get very scared (also writing all this made me feel a little anxious again) ",anxiety

"I have anxiety quitting my job Please give me the courage to quit my job. I hate my current job but I feel guilty quitting cause I started 3 months ago. 

Overall, the negative of the job is my boss. She scolds us when we make mistakes and can be demeaning, as if she is speaking to someone she thinks is inferior. Over the past month, I have been scolded or called out by her 4 times. I can’t tell you exactly if it’s my fault or her fault I’m making mistakes. What I suspect is that I’m not understanding the instructions she gives me the way she intends them to. So, she gives me instructions and I follow them, just for her to tell me I followed them wrong and didn’t do as she asked. It makes me feel hopeless because I am genuinely trying my best, but every assignment I hand in to her gives me anxiety because I’m afraid that I understood her wrong and she’ll scold me.

It’s gotten to the point where I’m crying almost everyday because of the stress and anxiety. I dread going to sleep and waking up for work. I dread receiving emails from her. I dread seeing her. On days that I work from home, I’ve noticed I cannot will myself to get out of bed because of how much anxiety I feel. So I would just work in bed because I don’t know what else to do.

Seeing today how my boyfriend, while home for his lunch break, had to make lunch and carry it up to me in bed to make sure I’ll eat, was the last straw for me. This is not who I am, nor who I wanted to be. I didn’t used to be like this. I don’t want the people I love to see me like this. So I want to quit before my mental health tanks even deeper.

I knew how important this exam was so finished my first paper with everything I had. I opened my second paper, feeling exhausted and sick already, and noticing that it was harder than my mock exam but deciding to give it a go. Now, at the beginning of the exam the supervisors said that if anyone felt unwell they should let someone know. I also knew that where I live if something happens my mock exam grade could be used if I had to leave or was deemed no longer fit to take the exam. My head felt considerably light, and I knew if I wanted a high grade I was going to have to push so hard to get myself around the questions. Because my mock exam grade is relatively high (20/24) and the vomit feeling was rising in my throat and I just couldn't write anymore. I knew if i stayed there my high grade would become a fail, and I would've pushed myself through for nothing. I am not the type to make split decisions, but I am scared of vomiting. I just couldn't anymore. I was too hot, the room was spinning. I put up my hand and before I knew it I was asking the supervisor what happens if I'm too sick to continue. I was taken outside for water and still felt bad, and decided I couldn't sit the rest of the exam. I've made an appointment with my doctor because in order to apply for my mock exam grade I need to get a medical note. Now that I'm feeling a bit better I have this awful feeling that I did it on purpose, and I'm a terrible person who took the easy route out to get a good grade, because once I was taken home I felt such relief and happiness that the whole ordeal was over and I could just sit and feel bad comfortably. Like maybe the exam was too hard and I was just lazy. But I also know that if I stayed in there I would do incredibly badly because I didn't have the ability to think straight to do the harder questions, and I would have failed and my future would have suffered, and derived grades are for the purpose of incidents such as mine. As you can tell I'm not usually the type to just quit on an exam (unless its algebra) and I'm being very hard on myself for giving in and giving up. Please give me some insight on your opinion so my brain stops fighting. 

TLDR: I felt I couldn't sit an exam due to sickness so chose to go home and stick with my high mock grade rather than failing, and now I feel like I lied and am a cheat. ",anxiety
"Unique Experiences with Paranoia Just out of curiousity, does anyone else struggle with paranoia around nonhuman entities/fictional monsters?

I've struggled with pretty extreme paranoia like this for as long as I can remember. Every so often my brain latches onto a new fictional monster or scary image for me to get paranoid about. I get obsessed with the idea that something is always out of view to the point that it taps into my OCD.

I'm assuming this is linked to my GAD, so I'm wondering if other people here have had similar experiences.",anxiety

"Too anxious to work Has anyone else experienced this? My anxiety has gotten so bad that it’s affected my physical health so much. I’ve been hospitalised, seeing countless specialists running countless tests, but deep down I feel like it’s just stress triggering my existing anxiety that’s made me so physically unwell. Regardless of my physical health, which I’m getting seen to properly by doctors, I’m also just too anxious to work. I’ve had a good job for 6 months, but it’s a very stressful one.

"My depression and anxiety are taking over and it feels hopeless (TW: mentions of drug/ alcohol abuse and miscarriage)  Struggling with depression and anxiety it all seems hopeless 

Massively struggling with depression 

I’m 23 y/o and this feels like it has been the most difficult year of my life. 

- I have been battling with a drug and alcohol addiction, and I am managing to stay off drugs now and I am slowly lessening the drinking. 

-I have suffered two miscarriages both to a man who doesn’t want to be with me but has been there for me through a lot. 

- This man has lived with me for the past year and although it hasn’t been easy, I love his company. He is now moving out to his own place and I feel like he is going to abandon me now.

- I am really struggling with debts but I am communicating with a debt help company who are mitigating this for me and I am paying whatever I can every month to help resolve this but it just seems like a never ending cycle. 

- I work two jobs that have been on my ass due me taking a prolonged/ long period of sickness due to me being chronically ill as well as the miscarriages traumatising me both physically and mentally. 

- I have been in and out of the doctors for the past 6 months and I am currently getting psychological help for my poor mental state 

- I am very distant from my family as they are dysfunctional and contribute massively to my mental illness from when I am around them and I have distanced myself from a lot of friends this year for not respecting my boundaries.

- I live with a roommate who used to be my best friend but we are just tense with each other all the time now because she also did not respect my boundaries and has flirted/ tried it on with every guy I have been with and found out she has taken advantage of people when intoxicated as well. 

I am 23 years old and I already feel like I have massively fucked up my life, I live in an apartment I can just about afford but the debts, jobs, illnesses and everything else is all weighing on my mind and I feel like I’m dealing with it all on my own.

I’m considering a change in career path (I currently work an office job and bartend on evenings/ weekends) working in either event organisation online or becoming a tattoo artist as my current jobs make me miserable and contribute to my illnesses whereas a career change into those two would really help me mentally as they have both always been a hyper-fixation of mine.

I just feel stuck. I don’t know where to go from here.",anxiety

"Is this a safe space? I’m so effing depressed and I keep making decisions to make me more depressed. I’m a serial job quitter and no I’m not proud of it. But at my big age I’m just now realizing that 9to5 s just aren’t for me. My mental is not stable. I’ve quit like 5 jobs this year and the last few decent jobs I had were really good to me. Idk why I allow my own thoughts to keep me from succeeding. Instead of taking it in the chin and telling myself im overthinking things I just quit and fall deeper into depression. 

I literally can think back and say I’ve had some decent jobs… (although they were minimum wage). I’ve never had that good government/state job that my parents always wanted me to get. Because everything is about setting up for your future/retirement. All my jobs have been temp jobs/ and retail/restaurant/customer service jobs. I love to cook and I’ve just always been good with restaurant jobs and retail. But the people stress me out then I quit without notice. I feel like my life is going in circles. 

I just want to be proud of myself. I have so many ideas that I start and never finish. My parents both have been blessed with decent situations so they were able to do whatever but had skills. My pops was a sheetmetal construction worker making 40 something an hour and had a Union. He did that for years and got bored with it. He now works in a mental asylum and loves it but hates the hours. They were married but separated before I was born. They both got remarried My mom is more on the artsy side, and had a rough life. She was a bartender for years then married a narcissistic abusive husband and we lived through that for 20 years. I watched my mom go from superwoman to needing me to hold her down. She struggled behind that and I struggled watching her and lost myself because I felt like I didn’t need my own life because my mom needed me. I mean I did stuff but I never went away for school, or moved out on my own. I always lived with someone. 

Anyway my mom and I got a place together and we split the bills. We have both been suffering from depression and we get into it sometimes but we need each other. For now. But me and my serial job quitting ways is getting frustrating my mom is tired of my shit. I always find a way to help out with the bills but eventually that money runs out and I need another solution. We are both talented but have been procrastinating and living in our heads for the past three years. I’m just tired. Mentally and physically. I just quit another job but it was seasonal but I quit it because idek I don’t have a legit reason 😔 and I’m doing doordash to supplement income but my car’s transmission is going bad. I’m so fed up with myself and my life I want more for myself. 

I want to be able to take care of my mom so she doesn’t have to worry about anything. She’s been holding me down while I’ve been stuck in this rut. I watched my little sisters graduate college and the youngest one will be graduating next year. Here I am no degree hella debt and mentally unstable. My one little sister became a nurse and has started a family and everything. My other little sister went to an arts school and the last one will be getting her degree in psychology. My oldest brother can literally build anything and has trades but he’s like me. He quits jobs after he makes a quick $1k then asks everyone for money. But he lives in nyc and is able to find better opportunities out there. We are originally from NYC, but have been living in Jersey for the past 20 years. I love Jersey it has become my safe place. But the opportunities out here are far and few. Which would be a reason for me to stick with something right? I know…. Can someone give me advice please. Oh let me add I also have another job lined up at a warehouse 🙄 I start it on Monday. I took it because it was close by and I’m off on weekends. I just pray I stick with it long enough. 

I’m sorry for the emotional dump but I needed to vent. I’m open to constructive feedback but please be kind. I come on here and find people with similar stories to mine to feel at ease but today I decided to write my own. ",anxiety

"I Had an Episode During a Drug Test, and My Supervisor Surprised Me Hi everyone,

I wanted to share an experience I had recently that really opened my eyes. I’ve dealt with paruresis (shy bladder syndrome) for a long time. It’s one of those invisible struggles that I don’t talk about, even though it’s a big source of anxiety in my life. Most of the time, I can avoid situations where it’s a problem, but recently I had to do a mandatory drug test at work, and it hit me hard.

As soon as I walked into the testing room, the familiar feeling kicked in: my heart racing, my mind spiraling, and that crushing feeling of, ""What if I can't go? What will they think of me?"" I tried, but nothing happened. I was frozen and mortified, feeling like I’d been exposed in the worst way.

But then, something I never expected happened. My supervisor noticed I was struggling, and instead of making it awkward or pressuring me, she came over and gently asked if I was okay. She didn’t make a big deal about it or ask intrusive questions. She simply said, ""It’s okay. If you need a moment, take all the time you need.""

We stepped outside for some fresh air, and she shared that her own friend struggles with anxiety around similar situations. She even mentioned that our company offers mental health resources, including some support for anxiety-related conditions. She told me I could try again whenever I felt ready, with no rush or judgment.

I used to think that revealing something like this would make me seem weak or unprofessional, but her understanding changed my perspective. If you’re dealing with something similar, whether it’s paruresis, social anxiety, or any other hidden struggle, please know there are people who genuinely understand and want to help. There’s no shame in needing a little extra support.

Stay strong, everyone",anxiety

Ever since there every day I feel like something’s wrong with my heart I can’t explain exactly what I feel but I’ve had many panic attacks because of it.(I’ve never had any mental or physical problems before this) the only way I can get it to semi go away is to get piss drunk. I just went to the ER 2 days ago because it got so bad but they said I was perfectly healthy… and as soon as I got to the hospital and got hooked up to the ekg I felt fine again. So I feel like it’s a mental thing. They told me I might have heart anxiety and that I should get checked for it. I have appointments now but it still gets so bad during the day until I drink to get my mind off it until I go to sleep. Then it repeats again the next day. What should I do?

"I just want to go to bed Dude it's like 10:40 pm right now, later than what I would perfer to go to bed at. But I'm currently sitting in bed, awake with a really stuffed up nose from crying because when I try to lay down I have a hard time breathing, no matter what position I lay down in. I've had this for a little while now, but a few minutes ago I was a having a mini anxiety episode because couldn't breathe normally without thinking about it too much and I kept getting these stupid freaking heart palpitations (which I've been getting more frequently now and it's pure bullcrap) Anyways, every time I get that darn flutter or sudden thump in my chest, I panic a little because of course I think it's serious when it's apparently normal but of course I still worry about it because I have horrible death anxiety. Let me put a little more context in here, this all started when I layed down on my side while watching TV and started to feel a little antsy for some reason. Then I kept accidently breathing irregularly which made my blood pressure rise a little since I wasn't taking full breaths. So that caused me to start feeling light headed and shaky which resulted in my derealization being triggered by the stress of not being able to stop this. I tried to calm myself down but it wasn't going away, so then I got myself irritated and worked up because I couldn't calm down enough to go to sleep. Then that's when I started crying and my heart palpitations kicked in for about a minute and it started to worry me so that made me cry even more. I tried to ground myself and take deep breaths through my mouth because my nose was too clogged up. Right now I feel better but I still have derealization.
 (Sorry, this was a very messy rant. I suck at neatly explaining things. I just don't want to feel alone right now)
[Side note: I looked up trouble breathing when laying down and it mentioned heart disease which, my fault, I looked it up on Google which was a stupid idea, but of course that wasn't a pleasant thing to see. Another source said it was because of my anxiety which calmed me a little, but i still even have slight trouble breathing laying down even if I don't have anxiety so I don't really know]",anxiety
"Looking for advice Hi there! I’m looking for advice or to know your experiences with procrastinating because of being so overwhelmed with having a noisy head while trying to work on anything. People often say: don’t think just do it/ 5 seconds rule/ start and you’ll build momentum/ eat the frog/ quit the illusion of perfectionism/ use the pomodoro  technique. While all these are great suggestions, they still don’t work for me because my problem is the inability to focus on the task from the non-stop fearful thoughts. It feels like multitasking between working on the task and trying to quiet my brain or respond to the persistent anxious thoughts (which a lot of the time sound rational and worthy of attention so, I always fall for it). My fear response slows me down so much, I don’t know what to do about it!! All of this creates quite a stressful, resulting in a feedback loop that makes me chronically procrastinate and conclude that I’m incompetent. I’ve been like this for many years and it’s starting to get worse. Nothing has worked. Body doubling helps only a little and not all the time. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and CPTSD and have been doing therapy and taking meds for many years yet. I haven’t gotten any better with procrastination and I’ve been so frustrated about it all, to the point that I’ve gotten depressed because I continue to resent myself for being incompetent. 

I’m open for feedback and would really appreciate receiving advice on the matter. Thx!!",anxiety
"Is clumsiness a part of anxiety? Hey yall, so I’ve had terrible crippling anxiety pretty much my entire life, and I’m also literally the clumsiest person on the planet. I’m just wondering if anyone else is like this and how closely related clumsiness is to anxiety? Like it’s actually so so bad and it honestly just makes my anxiety a hundred times worse because I embarrass myself so often and I can’t help it. For context, my anxiety is mostly social-related and I recently moved away to college about a month ago. Ever since then, my clumsiness has gotten much worse. I frequently knock over drinks, trip over things, move too fast without thinking which causes things to fall apart. I break things without meaning to. My boyfriend is an absolute gem of a person but I feel so so bad because he’s constantly cleaning up my messes due to my clumsy behavior. I can tell that he’s getting a bit annoyed as well which is totally understandable, I would be annoyed too. At first my clumsiness was kind of cute and funny like those quirky girls in the movies that have clumsy behavior, but now I just feel like an idiot and a total embarrassment. I think it’s largely related to my anxiety because I notice that when I’m by myself, I’m actually a very efficient and coordinated person, but once I get into a social situation, it’s game over. The brain is so weird, I don’t even totally get it because I play violin which requires extreme coordination and attention, and I’m pretty amazing at it, I’ve been playing since I was six, so like why is my coordination so good when I do that but so terrible when I’m doing much simpler things?",anxiety

Rationally i know that the pain in my stomach is probably constipation and stomach issues, the pains in my body is from sitting like a crescent moon for hours on the floor crocheting. My neck hurts because i sleep like im dead, i feel dizzy and faint  probably for all of these reasons. Rationally I KNOW THAT IM OKAY. 

Now, anxiety brain cant take rationality seriously. I havent slept so im having paranoia insomnia and im gonna go crazy and rip my eyes out! Dehydrated?? Youre so dehydrated your body will shut down and your kidneys are failing!! The pains in your body?? A disease! Als at the age of 19! Your neck hurts because you actually broke it:/ You feel dizzy and youre gonna pass out and die, you will pass out and no one will help you, you probably have an autoimmune disease. 

Anxiety brain sounds stupid. Who let anxiety have room to think? Anxiety sucks. I have a hard time thinking rationally but when i sit back and realize how crazy my anxiety sounds i have to laugh. Maybe this will help me get over it ",anxiety
"I need other people's opinions. Requesting a reality check I feel like my anxiety might just be shifting to a different form instead of getting ""cured"". This will be a bit of a long post, so believe me, I'll be thankful for anybody that reads and comments.

For background information, I've been a typical failure-to-launch sort. Major depression and anxiety since late high school. Graduated college in late 2019 without a clue what kind of career I wanted. I couldn't even get job interviews after hundreds of applications. Put on tons of weight. I would try a med and find it only smoothed the lows of my depression but never gave me a kick. I did get some work as a public employee for 8 months in 2023 but I didn't like the job, and felt guilty for doing so. 

I got so sick of where I was heading in life that at the end of March I committed to weight loss, and am glad to say I'm down 70lbs. I got a mood high in September and knew that if I wanted it to last, I needed to grab on and not let go. I went and saw a psychiatrist in person for once (instead of online general practioners thru plushcare). 

I'm now 6 weeks in on fluoxetine and 3 weeks on trazodone and after some soul searching, I could fucking cry about how much my mood has changed for the better. I actually know, *really* know what I want out of life now, career wise and dating wise. I've been energetic and happy before in early high school, but I've never felt such a radiant clarity in my entire life. I want to get out of my parent's house ASAP and have been applying for the bottom level jobs in a field I like and plan to work my way up. I don't care if it takes a year or two of low paying grunt work. I want my own life, damn it!

I think my depression is entirely gone at this point, but I still have anxiety, though I think its from a healthier place. I used to play video games a lot as it was the only way I could feel things in the depression malaise. Before my mood high in September, the anhedonia from my depression was hitting hard and I couldn't even get that release anymore. I'd just feel guilty and worthless and stare a screen, listlessly clicking around. 

This is going to sound insane, but I'm legitimately concerned there's something wrong with the fact that, by myself, I can't play video games or watch TV for more than an hour or two without getting an ""ick"". I'll get up and go clean something, or do chores, or work on some plan for my future like a budget, look at apartments around town on zillow, etc. This morning I drove my folks to the airport, came home and went on my morning walk, went to the pharmacy, made a spreadsheet for workouts, then went grocery shopping. Have had very little desire to touch the TV or video games all day. It's not the same miserable, zombified stewing from the past, but still.

I can't help but feel I'm ""broken"" with regard to that and it's kind of concerning. I still enjoy some game time with friends after dinner for a few hours after dinner, but all the single player games I used to play and love have very little allure anymore. 

**My big question is this: Is this how ""normal"" people feel, or is my anxiety killing my hobbies and now I need to feel ""productive"" to soothe it?**",anxiety
"My own mind might destroy my future I'm a first gen student in STEM. I'm graduating soon, and applying to med school, but I feel like every decision I've made in the last two months is slowly killing me.

I tried nonstop to get in involved in undergraduate research to make myself more competitive and after trying hard, I joined a lab that has nothing to do with what I actually want to do. I try my hardest but I feel like nothing I do is enough in research - not even enough for a letter of recommendation. 

I don't sleep well, I went from being well exercised to gaining a ton of weight. I can't even have a day off because when I don't have something due or an exam, I have an obligation at the lab. I'm so burnt out that I can't even function properly. My grades are starting to slip, my research advisors are losing their patience with me, and since I don't have that letter all I can do is sit and watch as the timer for the applications deadlines comes ever closer. 

To make it worse? I feel like I have no support. My own mother scolds me whenever I tell her how anxious I am. My girlfriend couldn't give less of a shit about what I feel.  

Does anyone have any tips for how cope with this? I honestly don't know if this is just my own mind fearmongering me or what. ",anxiety

"Should I stay on buspirone? I'm on my third full day of buspirone and am feeling pretty bad. I feel sort of foggy, distant, and dull, and somehow even more anxious (and depressed). I don't know how to explain it but it kind of feels like my brain is encased in glass. It's messing with my sleep also. Right now I'm taking 7.5 mg 2x a day. Should I stay on it?

"SSRI's made me angry, and manic. Is there another good option?  I do have a doctors apt coming up, but figured id hear from you all as well.

I have tried around 5 or 6 different SSRI medications, and they all worked somewhat. They would reduce my anxiety, but I would have so many explosive moments of anger. I also would become really manic, when I never have a history of being manic.

After 7 years of being on them, I decided to taper off. My anger almost disappeared entirely. I still have some moments of getting cranky, but nothing like when I was on SSRI's.

I no longer have daily panic attacks, multiple times per day. So something positive came out of it, but I still can be a bit grumpy when anxious about stuff. I would like to not feel so stressed at work as well.

I am very likely neurodiverse as well. So i wonder if thats just part of the tism or adhd.

"Social Anxiety Frustration I’ve had generalized anxiety for as long as I can remember and I’ve recently been trying hard to recognize my triggers and push through things and get out of my comfort zone. And I’ve been doing pretty well! I’ve joined running clubs, and taken a couple classes here and there, but tonight I had a ballet class booked at a location I hadn’t been to before. 

Went all the way there, figured out how to get in the building (it was a weird side entrance with a doorbell to unlock the door), talked to the woman at the desk who explained where to go too quickly and didn’t elaborate when I tried to clarify, and lo and behold— I couldn’t figure out where my class was. And nobody else was around to ask! Soooo I just went home. 

Feeling embarrassed and defeated I’ll be honest. I’ll keep at it but I hate being a grown adult afraid of asking people questions. I’m glad I at least figured how to get in the building, because I was tempted to leave just at that lmao

"Weaning off Zoloft  I talked to my doctor today about starting to wean off Zoloft. I am starting Monday and I’m currently on 100MG’s.

"Feeling like the election turned out the way it did because I experienced happiness yetserday There's this pattern where every time I feel happy something horrific happens. Things are resolved at my nightmare apartment? My mom dies, and I may have been able to prevent it. I think I'm succeeding at work? I do something stupid that makes everyone resent me. I feel good about accomplishing an errand and filling the fridge and remember my car payment? My dog eats a sock under my watch and I have to spend a fortune to have it removed (which is when I became *really* obsessive checking to make sure everyone is put away. Walking to/from my car ten times some days to make sure all the doors are closed and dog crates are secure. I take videos showing everything is locked up but i still experience unbelievable dread the whole time im away from the house). It's basically always my fault the bad thing happens

"Does this sound like anxiety to you? I don't know if I have it, and I always feel bad categorizing myself as someone with anxiety because it trivializes those that do have it. Hope this does not fall under ""do not ask for medical diagnoses"", rather just asking if you have felt similar symptoms and what your experience with them has been.  


I think to some degree I've had some level of anxiousness for most of my adult life, circulating around life responsibilities, things passing me by too fast (window for having kids, starting a real career, funding retirement, trying to buy a house, etc.). A little over a year ago I got a job with way more responsibility, and without going in to too much details about my boss and work life, it causes a lot of stress. 



Within the last 4 months, I've had serious health issues including debilitating brain fog, inability to focus, fatigue and lack of motivation. This seems to be worse when I'm in situations I'm uncomfortable, or on days with high stress. 



I've done bloodwork panels chasing a dozen rabbit trails thinking I'm on to a physiological explanation to what's wrong with me, but everything says I'm as healthy as an ox. I did notice caffeine made it worse, so I cut out caffeine entirely. However, somedays are worse than others and it's still severe enough for me to question what's going on.

  
I have gone through bouts of thinking I have brain cancer, thinking I'm just ""bound to die"" at this point, which as a 30M I know is not a normal thought process but I can't help shaking it because these last 4 months have been grueling. 

  
All this to say, it makes me wonder if I've lived with anxiety to some extent for a long time, and now with this added responsibility it's adding up and overtaking my mental health. 

  
Any help is appreciated, thank you.",anxiety
"Adrenaline rushes over the littlest things I've (F28) been suffering from panic attacks for a decade. Since I started having panic attacks, I noticed that when I slightly exert myself, move around slightly fast, or turn my head a lot, I get a bit dizzy and experience a weird adrenaline rush like I just finished a marathon. Tingling in legs, weird head buzzing, sensitivity to light, shortness of breath, tightness in chest that sometimes feels like pressure or a weird bubble, rapid heartrate, and depersonalization lasts up to an hour or two. My brain feels like someone shook it up.

Usually this gets triggered by little things like mopping the floor at work or vacuuming the house. It's somehow very mentally overstimulating for my brain, and I don't understand how or why. Then when I get in the car, I'm over the edge and so overstimulated at that point that I often start having a panic attack and struggle to catch my breath.

I don't workout, but I'm not sedentary. My job requires me to be on my feet and walk around a lot, and at home, I'm normally chasing after my toddler or cleaning. Not overweight.

Does anyone else experience this or have any explanation? Like, I just don't get it. I don't feel like I should walk and work like a sloth just because my brain is so hypersensitive",anxiety

"Shame is a form of stress and can cause Anxiety! Back around 9 months ago I used vapes on and off over a 6 month period. Since then, despite me being a very mild asthmatic, every time I get even an ounce of chest pain, I constantly think I have some form of lung disease or cancer. I have had a chest x-ray and had two doctors listen to my chest and confirm that I’m all okay! They did find some nodules but they are apparently extremely common, regardless they ordered a CT, which I have been waiting about 4 months for and I still haven’t had even a letter about it.

My anxiety over the last say 5 months has been extrem, ending in 2 A&E/ER visits, one for my heart and one for my lungs, both of which came back fine! Despite this I still at time feel like something is really wrong, and I think a lot of it is to do with the fact I can’t forgive myself for even touching a vape to begin with!

"Hot lines vs warm lines  Hi. I am wondering about hotlines vs warm lines. I recently saw a post on social media talking about them. I’ve never heard of the term warm line before. So what is the difference? Does someone have to be super severely anxious and spiraling to call a hotline and if you’re only slightly anxious you call a warm line? Or am I misunderstanding? I ask because lately I’ve been really anxious but I can’t tell if I’m spiraling enough to need to call a hotline (ie not harming myself).

"I feel like a Hypochondriac Part of this I can thank my mother for, because as a kid my issues got ignored or just weren't a huge problem so they must not be that bad.

I (m) have always had a weird fascination yet fear of missing people, murder, crimes, lost media. I don't know why it can scare me and intrigue me.

I don't know when this started but it must have started by the latest 4 years ago when I found out about people who had been missing in my area, as well as Steve Irwin's passing. Another one of my fears is finding someone behind my shower curtain who is out to kill me. Combine these two things together and I was once afraid of showering. I would only shower if someone was the on the second floor of my house where my shower was. I think I out grew this fear by playing music while showering. I believe this gave me a false believe that someone was in the bathroom protecting me.

I don't know when the fear stopped but it at least stopped 2 years ago. But know, I have slowly stopped playing music in the shower because I had blocked out the fear.

But with recent events in my life. And once again finding out about missing people like Amy Lynn Bradley & Brandon Swanson. I'm slowly starting to get the fear again and I don't know what to do about it. With stuff like B.O. I can't not shower. I honestly don't know what to do.",anxiety
"On vacation not trying to ruin it, need help. I’m on vacation with my grandpa, his son (i don’t like him therefore he doesn’t get an honorific), and my cousins (his kids). from the moment i landed here he’s been calling me names, saying i was “on fucking pluto” and “a fucking freak” for saying i wanted to wake up early to beat lines and get shit done. he also rubbed it in my face about how much he hates mexican food and i love mexican food. we had mexican tonight and all he said was “this is fucking horrible” and kept asking “how fucking horrible is it”. btw every time it says “fucking” is not there for emphasis, he actually talks like that. he also treats his children like dirt (4 year old and two 2 year olds) and puts his wife on a pedestal because he knows if she leaves he’ll have nothing. here’s where my overthinking comes in; i told my grandpa about this and he said “he just has a warped sense of humor” and “i’ll talk to him anyway don’t worry”. oh but i’m scared shitless. what if he makes me leave early? what if it makes the downtalk worse? am i too soft? is he actually just joking or being an asshole? can i not take jokes? 

context: my dad talked to me this way. he would say “fuck you” and “you’re a little pussy that needs to be kicked out onto the streets” before he left my life for good. i endured so much verbal abuse from him i can’t take any more of it. maybe these are all triggers and i’m too offended and i’m gross and weird and i’m going to ruin the whole vacation for everyone. maybe it’s just my anxiety. i am so extremely lost.",anxiety
"Dealing with frequent anxiety attacks I've never been diagnosed with GAD, but have always been an anxious individual, after deciding to work on my mental health I was diagnosed with ADHD earlier this year, and heavily suspect that I may be Autistic 

I've been on medication for about 5 months now, and alot of my anxiety around work, performance, self-image etc. etc. have kind of been nipped in the bud, I rarely ever get anxious waiting for things like packages, appointments, meetings etc.. 

Anyways, whilst it has fixed that medium grade anxiety that just used to linger in my chest and throat all day long, I end up turning into an anxious ball of mess as the medication wears off - This doesn't happen every day, and it has been happening less and less but I've given up on trying to figure out what exactly triggers it. 

Sometimes, if I don't eat I don't get any anxiety, sometimes I do - I have never, ever had this type of anxiety until I started medication, its a very ""manageable"" anxiety, i.e if I pay attention to my heart rate, I can see it go down a little at times, or if I keep myself occupied, but more often than not I will start looking at my heart rate and as a result cause my anxiety to sky rocket even more. 

There's no clear 1 thing that triggers it, life over the past few months has been pretty stressful, and its natural to have some type of anxiety surrounding current life events, but this is completely different - I could be having a great day, and out of nowhere I will end up crashing because of my medication and then need to figure out ways to remedy the crash. 

I know this is largely related to my medication wearing off, but I find it odd that I get the exact same kind of anxiety when I eat sometimes 

My doctor suggested I either take Xanax or Propanolol, I'm hesitant on taking either in the interim as I'm wondering if there are larger lifestyle changes I can make that will help with this. 

Any tips/suggestions would be helpful, thank you!",anxiety

"How do I stop obsessing over romantic relationship Hi everyone,

Was originally going to post this in r/relationshipadvice but I think after some thinking and speaking with close friends I’ve realized this is much more of an anxiety problem than a relationship one. 

I’ve been seeing this woman for about 4 months. It’s definitely a situationship. I want things to move forward but she is cautious. LOGICALLY I understand her motivations. However EMOTIONALLY I am running through a million possibilities in my mind. I have been historically jealous and possessive in previous relationships. I think sometimes this drove past partners away. I have also been cheated on and my most recent partner was physically and emotionally abusive. 

The long and the short of it is this. I cannot stop thinking about her going behind my back and sleeping with someone else. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve been waking up from nightmares and having a hard time eating.

I started spiraling, going to everyone I know for advice and getting a million different answers. It led me to nearly texting her to cut things off today. Thankfully I did some reflecting and I realized regardless of what I do, she has become a fixation. Even if I cut things off I would still be anxious imagining her sleeping with someone else. This is a me problem that I need to address. So that being said, does anyone have any tips for combatting anxious attachment? ",anxiety

"Does your anxiety ever give you pins and needles that lasts for hours? I had a bit of an anxiety attack today and last night. (and I used some marijuana both times before it happened.) but what was concerning is that I also felt basically complete numbness in my hand, forearm, and my foot (all on one side) and my lips and face felt that way too.

I have heard that anxiety causes tingling/numbness/pinsa and needles in your extremities, but how long does it last? If that ever happens to you? 

  
It lasted all night i think until i got up today. I didn't notice it for about 6+ hours when I got up and then this afternoon it came super suddenly again after i vaped and had a small panic attack.

"How do I cope with my anxiety until my psychiatrist appointment? Hey all,

Back in June I've set up an appointment with a psychiatrist which will take place in March 2025.

I thought I could just hold it out until then, I mean it's been in March this year that I first started realizing something might be wrong and I could trace these symptoms back multiple years, so what's a few more months? Right?

The last five weeks have been absolute hell for me. I have to spend so much time in public and it's causing me a crazy amount of anxiety and stress. During lectures I constantly try to keep my composure and at times to get my heart rate down, because it just decides to spike sometimes. Wednesdays are especially bad, since my schedule is really long, which left me just relieved today when the last lecture ended, like I just got away from a life or death situation.

I'd like to think that ever since finding out I could be mentally ill I've done a good job of slowly working through my mental problems in my head, expressing said problems through art and keeping an optimistic outlook on things, however as of late I can feel the tides start to turn.

I am slowly starting to feel myself become numb, more cold and withdrawn. I know that this isn't a healthy coping mechanism, but it's difficult to just go on allowing myself to feel every emotion. The last few months I tried to become more social and even managed to make a friend, yet right now I feel like I should distance myself from them and fade into obscurity, ruining all of my progress. Today I delibrately didn't approach them because I felt too 'unstable' to do so.

"If you're super anxious about the events yesterday in the USA, I highly recommend checking yourself to make sure you aren't catastrophizing. *Linked an informational video in the comments*

Catastrophizing is when we automatically jump to the absolute worst, most disastrous conclusions about a situation, without being able to fully back it up with facts or trying to see other more helpful and *realistic* perspectives.

It can be very hard to open ourselves up to the idea that not everything is awful, because awful can feel more comforting then uncertainty.

An example could be assuming that just because he is back in office means that everything is going to go totally wrong or we'll all lose our democracy or have a civil war, or people comparing Trump to Hitler (which btw is super disrespectful to those who endured the holocaust)... without looking into stuff like the ways the supreme court and the constitution has levels of control over him, how the state governments set boundaries and protections, past things that we did to get through and prevent future issues. Our countries political system is specifically built in a way that can allow someone to have authoritarian *influence*, but makes it virtually impossible for the president to become a *true* dictator (remember, he's only allowed 8 total years in office so after this term, hes out. That is in the constitution).

 And you know how hes said stuff about overturning amendments in the constitution? That has only happened once in US history, for prohibition, and requires cooperation from the supreme court, the senate, congress and 2/3 of all US states. 

What things have we bounced back from or have improved even despite him being around? Well for one, in 2021 we got the first female vice pres in all of American history, which alone, is monumental and *you* are here for that. *Texas* just got its first openly lgbtqia+ member of congress, and the first transgender woman to ever get elected into congress just got elected. These are already incredible steps that were totally overshadowed by Trump being elected. 

I'm *not* saying this isn't a bad situation for many of us, and I'm not saying it's wrong to feel upset or worried or that you should just ""look on the bright side"", but I'm saying that the future implications most likely will not amount to being the *absolute worst things possible* that the news, our anxiety or our family/friends would lead us to believe.

I definitely recommend just trying to open yourself up to the idea that *maybe, just possibly*... everything won't go absolutely wrong, and looking into the video linked. And being open to challenging your thinking.",anxiety

"I can’t even drive my car anymore 

Uk based:

I’ve had anxiety since I was about 14 years old (now 30F). But ever since 2020 it has completely spiralled. I now have bruxisim (teeth grinding) that’s come from my anxiety and that’s a whole other issue and a very expensive one. 

I have never felt very supported with my MH. My parents don’t believe in what they can’t see, I’m sick of people telling me to ‘just get out the house and go for a walk you’ll feel better’ ‘do this you’ll feel better’ nothing makes me feel better. 

Years of therapy, cbt different antidepressants. Taking vitamins, b12 shots.

Last month I rang my doctors surgery in a crisis.
They rang me back same day and I just cried to this doctor on the phone. I told her I don’t want any ssris as they make my bruxism x10 worse. So she said try propanol? 3x a day. But this is for the physical symptoms. Which in a panic I do get. But I just want to not have to build up to the panic mode.

I haven’t driven my car in over a year. I’m now petrified to drive. (No idea why brain just told me one day I can’t drive so now I physically cannot force myself into the car)

Socially, awful. Hate it.
If there’s a big event, wedding/christmas/birthday/celebration anything out of routine. I go into overwhelmed melt down. My brain fog is off the chart. I have two little boys and I just feel like I absolutely suck and I’m failing them so badly.

I always put them first no matter how bad I feel I get up, be a mum. Drop them to school pretend to be the happy smiley ‘got it all together’ mum. 

I had a business 4 years ago. I was so independent. Although I’ve always struggled with anxiety it’s never been so triggering and irrational as it is now. It makes me so sad and so lonely.

"Pregnancy Scare / Anxiety 
Hi all, could use some advice!

First time poster, long-time lurker. Also have dealt with a slew of different types of anxiety in my life…now it’s just focused on a fear of becoming pregnant.

My (32F) husband and I had protected sex on 10/14ish (day 14) of my cycle, and according to my app (which I know isn’t positively reliable) I was set to ovulate on day 17. We used a condom and there didn’t seem to be any tears or anything like that. 

Today 11/06 I’m about 3 days late on a generally predictable cycle (usually 31-33 days, I’m on day 37) with horrible panic attacks and anxiety. We had a negative pregnancy test yesterday (11/05) morning and I think I’m going to take another this evening just to ease my mind.

It’s  important to note that I already experience pregnancy anxiety almost monthly, since having our first child early 2023 and having a heartbreaking slip that resulted in a termination shortly after our first was born. That was my only abortion. I do talk to my therapist about it and my partner is super supportive.

Also, it was a heavy month with stress (horrible coworker issues and the death of a close family friend, including interacting with family members I am low contact with as a result). And I also started using nicotine products again as of this month.

Honestly, I’m really scared right now. We are a stable happy couple, but I don’t want to have another child for a couple years…I want to give my boy all the attention I have, for deep reasons I won’t get into here. 

Looking for some reassurance! Thanks in advanced for the insight.",anxiety
"How do I win the battle against catastrophizing?  I’ve been struggling with this for a long time now. In every situation, my mind concludes that the worst possible outcome happened, convinces me, and I start to full on panic because of it even though I have absolutely no evidence that this outcome is even real. 
For example, if my friend hasn’t been online for a while: my brain concludes something horrible happened and I panic until I’m able to reach them again. 
Someone left me on read: they hate me now for some reason and never want to talk to me again. 
My mother is late when coming home from work: something bad happened on the way.
What is worse is that my mind actually manages to convince me that these thoughts are reality and I start to suffer because of them. I even consider situations that I start to believe will happen years from now and I feel anxious when in reality those will probably not even happen. This gives me, aside from the panic, physical symptoms. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I vomit, I struggle to breathe…all because of scenarios from my mind that aren’t even true. 
Deep down, my brain knows that the assumptions are not true. But my panic speaks louder and I can’t really focus on anything else. My mind is like this 24/7. I feel like I’m going crazy. I’m exhausted. I’ve tried everything. I can’t get rid of this. What do I do? I need help. ",anxiety

"Can anxiety mess with your vision this much At the beginning of September I got covid and my health anxiety skyrocketed. I was having panic attacks daily struggling to get through work and I finally went to the doctor at the beginning of October to talk about anxiety medicine. I've been on a few before with different levels of success and this time we tried buspirone. After 4-5 days of taking it I was finally feeling like I was myself again, I went almost the whole weekend without any anxiety but that Sunday I was sitting around and a big wave of anxiety hit me and I started seeing a flashing in the center of my vision almost like a LED was sitting turning on and off non-stop. I went in the next day to the optometrist which said my eyes were perfectly healthy.  Over the next couple days the flashing calmed down a bit not being there 100% of the time but other things started including: 
-positive after images 
-visual trails behind anything moving
-small flashes in my vision as well as pinhole sized black spots that come and go but never last long
-bfep and floaters way more than normal
-eye pain like they were really dry. I would use eye drops and they would help a bit but not for long
 -I also noticed when I would close my eyes I would see these hazy blobs moving almost like a lava lamp. Not super bright but noticable even though I was in complete darkness
-having hypnogogic hallucinations that I've never had before. Like I would be almost asleep and start seeing things like i was watching a movie. I could almost control them. 

Since then a lot of it has seemed to calm down. The flashing in the center of my vision has turned more into a kind of static instead of a very sharp circle and it's not as bright and I only really notice it when I have my eyes closed or an looking at a blank wall or something. The floaters and bfep aren't as bothering and the white flashes and black pinholes have gone for the most part. My eye pain is mostly gone since I got new glasses and I don't think I'm straining my eyes as much. The sleep stuff is better but still there. But the positive afterimages and trails haven't seemed to get any better. I think I'm getting used to them more than anything but it's made things like watching tv hard because it seems like it's super low frame rate or something. 

The doctor said it could be the buspirone so when I stopped that he said it could be a couple weeks before it went away. After going back last week and telling him I'm still having problems we are getting an MRI scheduled to make sure nothing is wrong in the brain. He also switched me to Lexapro which has helped calm my anxiety and keep me able to function.

"Well.. is it hyper awareness?  I’ve been dealing with panic disorder being back for about a month and a week. Constant anxiety. Dizziness etc., but I’ve noticed over the last few days my dizziness gets worse after eating. Takes 15 or so minutes to start, and then lasts anywhere from 1-2 hours.

I do have pre hypertension. But I’m not sure that’s what’s causing it. My anxiety is so bad I’ve needed blood work for 3 weeks. And haven’t been able to get it. Everytime I go I have a panic attack and they won’t take my blood due to an increased risk of fainting. White coat syndrome 101. ",anxiety

"My anxiety is gonna make me lose a friendship Hi, I really need your help in this, like probably today is the last day of this friendship if I don't do something

I have a friend that I met 7 months ago, but still is that kind of friendship that feels like you've known the other person for a long time even if you haven't

The problem comes 2 weeks ago, she was always the one who started conversations, and then, suddenly stopped. I know why, she wanted to prove if I was gonna talk to her, and I really wanted to, but my anxiety didn't let me, and while time passed, my thoughts grew, things like ""How do I start this conversation?"" ""How am I gonna just go talk to her when we haven't talked in 2 weeks?"" ""Even if I start the conversation, what will we talk about? It's been two weeks"" ""What if nothing's like it was?""

And it's been two weeks, I've said sorry 2 times now (explaining her my social anxiety but still promising to try and start the conversation, also this means she even gave me a third opportunity). Yesterday I tried starting a conversation with her via chat 'cause I'm still way too nervous to start a conversation in person, and it went shitty, she was awkward, and I didn't know what to say

And today, at lunch time, one of my friends basically forced me to sit with her (thank God my friend also sat with me), but I just couldn't, my anxiety overcame me, I was too nervous, I didn't know how to start the conversation, and she just changed to another table with her friends

And then, I overhear a conversation of her and her friends talking abt me, and she's like ""I'm thinking if giving her a third opportunity was the right thing, if this doesn't improve, maybe it's time to say goodbye"" and her friends agreed, so if I don't do something soon, she will leave, and I don't want her to

So I need ideas, ideas to overcame my thoughts (the main one is thinking that it will be weird or uncomfortable, or that maybe she won't wanna talk to me, and also being super nervous when talking to her on person) and also ideas to start the conversation again after all of this, after we haven't talked in two weeks and after the mistake of today, because I just don't know how to start so the conversation will follow",anxiety

Ive had a LOT of things happen in the last year, a lot. Is that something that can bring on this kind of reaction? I was nauseous, unable to be around anyone, wanted to crawl out of my skin etc. I was sitting on the bathroom floor in a state of fight or flight. Ended up in the ER, twice. Second time was after 3 days on Prozac 20mgs, literally sent me spiraling, crying and wondering what is happening to me. Ended up going to the ER the second time for a psych evaluation because I was desperate. They gave me ativan IV, and also a dose of hydroxyzine 25 mgs. My psychiatrist that i JUST started seeing last Wednesday (not the one at the ER) now has me on Lamotrigine 25mgs once a day to start because after my reaction to Prozac we are under the assumption I am extremely sensitive to SSRIs.

Im praying this medicine helps me. Im also on a low dose of Buspar. I hate this recent onset. I DO NOT feel myself, ands its so scary. ",anxiety
"Therapist Distracted During Session. What Do I Do? At the beginning of our session today, I heard the sound of my therapists text notification go off multiple times. This is not uncommon, and he will typically say “Whoops. Let me put that on Do Not Disturb” or something. I think the phone is connected to his laptop in some way. I was in the middle of answering a question he asked me and it is SO HARD to be vulnerable. I heard the sound of an iPhone message being sent. There were several incoming and outgoing text messages over the next few minutes, and his eyes frequently shifted back and forth between me and his screen and he was typing. I eventually had his undivided attention for the rest of the session, but I completely shut down. 

I feel so unimportant. So embarrassed for being vulnerable today, and all the times in prior sessions. I feel so stupid for any thought I’ve ever had that lead me to believe we are a team and is attuned. 

I’m a big fawner. I’d have a hard time addressing this. Part of me wants to just move on like nothing ever happened, and just ghost if it ever happens again. Another part of me wants to confront him maybe in an email and say “this is what you did and this is how I feel” but I’m a big fawner and don’t think I would. 

I also can’t imagine any other scenario besides showing up next week with all this hurt and shame and being completely unable to engage in therapy. 

I’m in therapy for trauma. A lot of relational trauma. IYKYK. 

Please help. This hurts so bad. ",anxiety

Getting out of bed has become a chore Almost every day I dread getting out of bed. I wake up sick to my stomach worrying about having to go to work. I just started not too long ago at my first job as a cashier. The place is ok. The people are nice enough. But I’m not ok. I worry every single day about going in. Then when I get home I’m exhausted and worry about having to go back. Even on my days off I worry about going in. I disassociate to the point of where I don’t remember things. I am autistic and anxiety ridden. My brain is constantly thinking about negative things even when I try not to. I just feel mentally and physically drained. I don’t know what to do at this point because it feels like I have tried just about everything. From over the counter meds to counseling. And while they help in the moment they don’t help in the long run. I feel like I am just dragging by without much of anything to look forward to. The only reason I even try is my family.

Genuinely how do you find a therapist  I can never do it. I look on all the websites and read all the reviews but I can never decide.

She was great but I have to find someone new now. I just don't know how to decide and I really need help,anxiety

"Spiraling is horrible today. Sorry for grammar I don't type right when I'm anxious like this Yesterday, I had a massive appointment with my gynecologist to figure out some strange symptoms in my body (ended up diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis) and I was given a bunch of meds. I am extremely anxious with meds as someone who also has POTS & Dysautonomia.

Once, I was put on Lamictal & Risperidone, which made my heart so out of rhythm and whatnot that I was hospitalized. Found out that women my age, with the conditions I have, should not be given those meds because people have died taking them or ended up seriously hurt. It took WEEKS for my body to feel slightly normal again, and I still have problems with my heart to this day from it. Recently, I was given Macrobid and I also had a very terrifying reaction to it.

Because of these experiences, I am deathly terrified of any med I'm given, even antibiotics or simple medicines, like cough medicines, laxatives, Benadryl, or even antacids. The only med I can take without having a panic attack is my Atenolol, because it regulates my heartbeat and helps me sleep. I also don't drink anything but water and only eat plain white rice these days because most foods will trigger my body to feel like I'm dying. My body flushes, my heartrate goes up, and my anxiety spikes. My guts will hurt, my bladder will hurt, and everything just feels awful.

On top of this, I'm anxious about the election results, and deathly afraid as the senator in my state who was elected wants to get rid of Medicare and Social Security, things I rely on to get medical help, feed me and my 2 cats, etc. I feel like my safety net is completely gone even with the money I do have saved up, and I feel like I am not going to survive the next 4 years. I am guaranteed going to die if these people's laws become reality. I worry about my mom, too. She has Parkinson's and is also on Medicare, and without her meds she wouldn't be able to survive longer than 3 days. I keep trying to tell myself that everything will be okay, and that I'm overthinking, but I can't help to think that my fear is very real and not just because I'm going crazy.

My family, mostly very conservative, were having a group-text party thing celebrating the election today, and I just couldn't take it anymore. I had a split (I have BPD) and I went off on every one of them, saying that if I die from the laws made by the people they elected, that their blood is in my hands and my death will be their fault. I was of course, met with resistance and the whole ""God will heal you, just pray to him"" speech I usually get. My sister tried to reason with me, but I was too far gone in my BPD spiral to accept anything she was saying, and she angrily left the group chat telling me to get out of my irrational thinking.

So now I'm ashamed at the bridges I've burnt, and feel like a failure as once again, I've had a split. I will always feel like until the day I never have an outburst or split again, that I will be unlovable, unworthy, and a horrible, toxic person. My anxiety is filled with the words I've seen people write about people with BPD. How they're less than human, not normal, and that even if they're in therapy, they'll never truly be changed and will always at some point become an issue again, never deserving of love or even a chance at redemption. This is how I feel about myself.

I've had people tell me ""you've changed a lot since you left your ex, you're handling things better"", but all I hear in my mind is the people who say that BPD people will never be good enough because they're always going to be a problem. I can never accept the good things about me that people tell me. And each time I slip up and let my emotions out, I am convinced once again that they are absolutely correct and that there is no hope for me, as I know it's impossible for me to live the rest of my life without having an emotional outburst. I drive people away because of my paranoia during an outburst. My anxiety goes into overdrive, and I question every little word someone says to me in an attempt to comfort me. I can't help it, it's almost like it's hardwired in me to do so because I just know deep down, what I've been conditioned to believe by what I've seen is true, as I'm doing the exact things that I'm told are not acceptable, like cry, scream, throw things or break things, etc etc.

3 years of therapy, and actively practicing the skills I've been taught, writing things down and studying new strategies to help me better, and I've only maybe gotten better in my opinion about 20%. My parents will say I'm much better than before, but I know they're biased because they're my parents. The rest of my family doesn't know the full extent of my outbursts, and even with how awful I was today, they haven't even fully seen me at my worst so I can't speak for them. I'm scared of making my therapist exhausted with me because I keep coming to her with the same issues and she has to repeat ""Well let's go back to this strategy again"". If I was truly getting better, I'd have mastered that strategy by now, wouldn't I have? I wouldn't be tiring out professionals by coming back to them with the same complaints if I actually was getting better.

Hence why I think I'm not better. That I'm just lying to myself and that because of how damaged I am, I won't ever reach perfection. I know I'm not making excuses to not take what my therapist has said to heart and practice the skills I've learned in therapy, because I really do. I have hundreds of pages written down of things I've actively practiced, and I have seen results, even some outbursts were avoided entirely from the skills I've utilized. But I feel like until the day I never have an outburst again, or a BPD spiral, or any slip ups, that I'll never be able to say ""I'm better"" or ""I'm healed"", and that I can't accept the title or compliments from others saying I am better at managing my emotions. Because deep down I feel like I'm not. Is that a weird form of imposter syndrome? I don't know anymore.

I want to live because I don't want to abandon the ability to experience good things, like my cats, nature, music, etc etc by being dead, but sometimes I wonder if it would be better if I was dead because I wouldn't have anything to worry about. Then when I'm on that line of thought, I get scared because of the whole ""Be careful what you wish for"" thing and I try to think ""No I want to live, please don't let me die I take it back"" and I cry thinking I'm gonna die. Holy hell this is exhausting",anxiety

If we let him keep the prescription himself he rushes through it in 2 weeks and then eventually when it leaves his system he goes batshit crazy and we have to baker act him.  He has been baker acted probably 4 times now.  Has tens of thousands of dollars of Medical Debt because of that.  Now I control his medication so that doesn't happen again.  This month he got a new generic which I can tell is Aurobindo made in India.  Has a 2 on the front and a split on the back.  These pills are obviously not working.  Being around him I can tell immediately when he is off.  He has about 2 weeks left until his next refill.  My question is can I perhaps return the current pills to the pharmacy and maybe they can switch them.  Because in a few more days here we are gonna have to baker act him again.  He usually stays up nonstop and starts saying really crazy shit.  It is not fun to deal with this.  Can his therapist make a script for teva brand only?  Can we go to different pharmacies until we get teva brand.  I mean other brands have worked but these Aurobindo are the worst so far.,anxiety

"Sleep anxiety, need advice need advice

Hello guys, i need some medication advice from you:)

First, im sorry for my english, im germanspeaking.

My situation: im studying and i have the problem, that before every exam-day, i cant sleep because of anxiety. in this moment i tell myself, that i need to be wellrested to sucseed in my exam. im working on that problem with my therapist, so pleace dont tell me now to just do some breathing exercieces etc.

i found a year ago a perfect solution: ambien. it worked like a charm, took all my anxiety away, and i could finally sleep well before my exams. the only problem is, that i do fu***** weird stuff on ambien. i sleepwalk and calling random people via phone while on it, so i cant take that anymore...:(

My solution: finding a ""good"" benzo. 
My question: which benzo can you recommend for sleeping? for me its important, that the medicine is able to ""knock me out"" besides my anxiety, but doesnt mess whith my sleep all to bad (i want to be well rested the next day for my exam). Please note: i only take this kind of pills one night in three moths, not one pill more, so please dont tell me the ""dont take benzos, theyre super dangerous and addictive etc"". -( i know that very well)) story, im just asking for some experiences! :)

my choice know would be diazepam or temazepam, both because of the longer half life (dont want to wake up in the middle of the night), and because i already know people who use these two for sleeping.

Thank you, and much love!!!

"Severe anxiety & depression over toxic workplace & boss Hi Guys, I had joined my current company in Feb of this year, and since past 2.5 months, my boss has been severely toxic to me(pointing out my non existent mistakes & making me feel bad publicly and speaking rudely) and also made the management share me a warning letter for my work performance (my performance has been nothing but exemplary out of all of my coworkers), she is pin pointing me in every task of mine which is making me to be on the edge & anxious all the time. Recently, few new coworkers have been added to our team as I think they are a substitute as I feel my boss is trying to make the management fire me & trying to stage all of the shortcomings of the team on me which is ridiculous because I've been performing consistently good. Also, every week , a new person will be joining team & I've been given the task to orient them. 

I'm trying my best to cover everything in orientation but even after office hours or during office , I'm having really bad anxiety that my boss will put the blame on me entirely if the new joiners will fail to perform.

My personal life has been hell since 3 months. It's either crying, or having ruminating thoughts or just having crippling anxiety in weekdays, weekends or after office. 

Even though I'm trying to better myself by being emotionally strong by practicing gratitude & mindfulness, I'm just constantly scared of what my boss will do or say if any of the new joiners will do something bad. At this stage, she's just trying to find & create new reasons to blame me.

"I am not sure about it Hello everyone, three days ago, I started working as a Jr. Sales Representative, specializing in advertising, at an SME in the media sector. Previously, I worked for 1.5 years as a Sales Support, but I didn’t gain direct sales experience there. My main role was bringing in leads via cold calling or mailing where I was successful and handing them over to the managers.

However, I have a deep-seated fear of  physical presenting and speaking. During presentation practice, I tend to freeze, forget what I know, and struggle to improvise. This makes me appear unnatural or awkward, almost robotic at times. Despite this, I believe I can improve if I confront these fears because this career has been my dream since childhood.

"Sick of these weird physical sensations My anxiety causes a slew of very odd physical sensations. I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced/experiences these sensations and what you did or what you do when you get them.

My skin feels like clay, like malleable clay, but not to the touch. When I move my muscles in my face the skin on it feels like it’s not moving for a few seconds and then I feel the sensation of it moving for like a few seconds after. I’d say crawling sensation but not quite. It’s almost like the delay in touch and motor function sensation you get from an anxiety attack caused by greening out, which I’ve had before and have trauma from, but I don’t understand why this sensation tends to happen even when I don’t smell weed or carts, since I do sometimes have that olfactory based trauma response.

This sensation is also accompanied by paresthesia in the mouth and usually follows getting agitated/irritated or anxious about something, or can randomly crop up because my subconscious anxiety just got triggered for no apparent reason. (Why I take .25 Xanax everyday on top of my 150 Wellbutrin I take at night, just so I can focus on my day and not worry about having to curb a panic attack on my own.)

I write this post because I had just recently had another bout of this… clay sensation and it drove me nuts, but not in a panicky way like it used to the last.. I wanna say five or six times I’ve had it come up. This time was different. It made me mad, I was frustrated at my subconscious and my body for bringing up this feeling again and convincing me it was real. Because it now’s know disgusting I think it is and how uncomfortable it makes me feel in my own body.

With that being said, can anyone tell me if you’ve had this sensation before, what this is from, what you call it, and what you do to get rid of it or prevent it even without medication?",anxiety

"Conflict anxiety I have recently become aware of my pretty severe confrontational anxiety. I always knew I didn't like conflict but recent events have made me realize that it's way deeper than that. 

I have been doing really well recently and all my other symptoms of depression and anxiety have decreased while my social anxiety has increased. Conflict is a HUGE trigger. I feel like I am back to square one. 

So my question is, how do you deal? Obviously conflict is important! It's an essential skill to healthy relationships and I get that. I am lucky to have a spouse who is considerate and kind so when we do disagree it is with extra awareness and sensitivty. I just can't expect everyone to be like that though (I used to and I would get so offended when they weren't as sensitive as me)

It is my personality that I am an impulsive talker. I just say what comes to my mind and don't always think it through. Being a stay at home mom for the last 6 years hasn't helped my social skills (but I love it!)

As a kid, I had learned it was better to keep my mouth shut in my own feelings (so much so that I convinced myself I was indifferent). I don't think I was ever real with people except for my husband/boyfriend at the time because he is such a nurturer.
I am an extreme people-pleaser and it is so exhausting that I don't like people anymore even though I have always thought of myself as an extrovert. 

I think the realization has been a little disheartening. I know this is going to take a lot of time to work through and it's hard to know what I'm ready for and what I'm not. I still have a family to care for and lots of responsibilities and dreams I can't just put on hold while I figure this out. 

I think sometimes exposure can work against me when things end up rotten and messy because I said something stupid that I didn't really mean or I didn't stop and think so I wasn't fully understanding. It's easy to feel confident when I am flawless but that is rarely really never the case.

I am aboriginal tribal racially. In india we are outcast. People hate us. We are discriminated. In grade 8, my studyios friends stopped talking to me once they talked about my caste. This continues even now while I am at uni.

I want to have more information as due to lack of right information I missed getting into a prestigious uni just some 30kms from my house. Ended up trying one year more for entrance exam and miserabley got ruined. I started to have a depressive period. I did not know what the depression is 🤣. I thought I m going through philosophical maturity and awakening 🤣.

My father also always compared to his colleagues and friends kids. He ridiculed me for being a bad son and I was burden and he is wasting money on me. Daily on dinner.

I also wasted the money over my coaching but couldn't clear the exam with flying marks. Now I am full of guilt and stingy.

Now I am into web dev and I got a few 5k offer for the internship. But I thought I should start at least 10k per month. But now I am in confusion.

I am afraid of people and making friends because of the bad treatment I had from my own father. Also the fact, people hate me merely for me being aboriginal. So I feel like people are against me.

"How to help/handle a partner that can't deal with the anxiety. I've dealt with generalized anxiety my entire life but about two months ago, everything got so much worse. 

I didn't even really know what was happening at first. I was having rolling panic attack after panic attack. Got to the point where I thought I had the flu for a week because I was so nauseous and weak all the time. I've come to realize that this is my anxiety and for many members of my family it just gets this bad when they hit their thirties. 

Dealing with my anxiety has been hard enough, but honestly my boyfriends reaction to it has made it so much harder and I dont know how to help him or if at this point I give a fuck to. 

The other day he informed that it has become hard to love me. That he doesn't think I'm doing enough to fix it. That I am being selfish. That he can't engage or talk to me unless I'm in a ""good moment."" 

Part of me wants to tell him to fuck off. I'm doing my best. I'm going to doctors, I'm going to therapy, I'm playing the medication game of trial and error. All while not being able to stop my self from going into shaking fits, and dizzy spells. 

Then there's the part of me that's sympathetic that understands that while yes it is hard for me to deal with this that it is strain on him as well. We've been together for 2 years and he didn't sign up to be with someone who at this point is a mostly house bound mess.  

I honestly just don't know how to help him navigate this as I am trying to figure it out myself. Do I just keep everything from him? Do I just accept that he's not the supportive type? 
Do I suggest support groups for people with loved ones with anxiety? Do I send articles about how one can help a loved one with anxiety?

Or do I accept that he's a fucking asshole and I shouldn't be responsible for taking care of him while I am in the middle of a major mental health crisis?",anxiety

How do I eat well while having anxiety ?? Don’t wanna loose weight 😭 Hey ! So I have been having anxiety for a long time and it keeps coming back once in a while when something triggers me . So during that time I don’t feel like eating at all . This makes me loose weight :/ since I’m already under weight I don’t wanna loose more weight. It’s been a week since I’m not eating properly because of the constant feeling of anxiety and uneasiness. I wanna eat well regardless!

"I study excessively as away to have control TL;DR: I think studying has become a compulsive behavior for me whenever I feel like I have no control over something. Just want to know other anxious people's experiences with this.

I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) since forever, and it affects my studies and general productivity very strongly. Studying is like my way of seeking control over my life. I'm currently in undergrad. When I feel sad, worried, overwhelmed, angry, for any reason outside of college, I sit down and study. Very often, I recognize studying so much is the exact reason why I feel tired and burned out, but I still do it. It's like a reflex. I take notes, read the book, solve and re-solve problems, work on assignments 10 days early, anything. I bury myself in it as deep as possible in order to forget the world, and cling to it as something I can control.

My grades are quite high because of this, but to me, they can never be high enough. I'm hypercritical of myself, and every little misstep feels huge. I'm at a constant state of worry and alertness, always asking myself what I have to do next.

I do have hobbies outside of it. I dance, draw, fold origamis, learn yarn work, etc. But even then, some of this drive to learn quickly and be better always spills over, even for the most innocent of activities like making amigurumi figures. I find myself practicing my dance routines tirelessly and never being satisfied with myself, for example. Or comparing my drawings and paintings to other people's and feeling sad. And, when I feel sad, I once again turn to burying myself in my studies.

I think my attitude towards it genuinely qualifies as a compulsion. I've been in therapy for a while, but never really used this term to refer to it until now. 

It's odd, because, to many people, being a workaholic is a good thing. I'm not harming myself, I'm just ""being productive"". It's good to always be working, to be so driven and focused; there are even a lot of tutorials of ""how to trick your brain and become addicted to studying!"". But it really is not cool. It's very tiring and I can never be happy with myself, because I'm constantly chasing my next goal and forfeiting things that would bring me joy in the name of it.

This is just me airing out my thoughts. I think this might be way too common and normalized, since the world is constantly asking more of us. Me being in academia definitely does not help, since the culture is so toxic. Share your experiences if you can relate to it, I'd like to hear from other people who might be struggling to get their minds out of ""productive mode"".",anxiety
"Scared of lymphoma and other cancers. Bloodwork is fine buy xray says "" increased airspace density over the right midlung"". Help 

Age 26

Sex female 

I have a fear of having a lymphoma or other cancers. Last couple of months I've been having night sweats. Not drenching but I feel my legs and lower back damp under the comforter. That's been happening last couple of months. Not every night but most nights. I also started to feel lower back pain especially when I bend over, it's not bad but I feel it. Last week I got some itchy throat followed by fever and chills which went down after taking ibuprofen. After this I got wheezing in my right lung and wheezing in throat. I went to the dr yesterday and she did my labs. Bloodwork came back in normal range. She ordered xray because she heard something on my lung and xray says: 

There is a subtle small area of increased airspace density over the right midlung with differential diagnosis of infection/inflammation. Recommend short-term radiograph follow-up.
 
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
No acute osseous abnormality within the visible skeleton.

She prescribed me prednisone and antibiotic for that. I didn't feel any wheezing today after I took prednisone yesterday. I still feel some weird tightness in my chest. I've been coughing more with mucus today too. My problem is that no one around me was sick. Not my son, not my husband. Well my husband got some infection like 3 weeks ago but that's a long time ago. I'm scared there is something developing in my lungs. I'm petrified and I can't even eat.

I haven't seen my xray but I was googling some lymphoma xray images and I'm scared there is something growing in my lung.

*Possible TW*: if you are trying to avoid election related posts, please skip this!💓

AND: I have seen some rude comments under other people’s posts. please refrain from insensitive or invalidating comments. do the right thing and be kind to others :) thanks!

Hi! I posted this under the election megathread, but I wanted to see if I could get any responses with a new post! 
Please help if you can, I haven’t been able to sleep since yesterday :/ (not for a lack of trying). To preface also, I am 22F and am diagnosed with CPTSD, panic disorder, GAD, depression, OCD, and ADHD. Sorry for the long post!

I feel like I have a pit/hole of emptiness in my chest. Once I realized what the results were going to be, every inch of me felt so crushed. Someone said they were in constant fight or flight mode, which I was in a few hours ago too. My mind and heart were, and are, like a ping pong machine. The emptiness/anxiety I feel inside of my chest is what I am left with now that the fight or flight has worn off (somewhat). As a woman in her 20s, my heart feels shattered. Tonights results led to one of the worst flare ups of my CPTSD that I’ve ever experienced. It took me back to when I woke up to my dad telling me who had won in 2016. I was just a young teenage girl at the time, and I could tell my dad was heart broken telling me that he had won the election. Looking back on this day, I see myself as just a little girl that I want to protect so badly. And I see my dad who I want to protect so badly, so he didn’t have to tell his daughter such news. While I didn’t particularly favor the candidate in 2016, the little girl in me was ecstatic at the thought of having the first female president. The same young girl that was crushed that day, feels even more shattered from the results today. I really thought we could do it. Tonight, that same young girl is screaming within my adult body, petrified of what is to come.

I completely broke down in tears and had a panic attack tonight in front of my parents. I never thought my dad would have to help me process the same 2016 election result but in 2024. It breaks my heart that he has to look at me crying out of fear, the fear of being a woman in this country. I have such a love for this world, but now I don’t want to have to sleep because then I’ll have to wake up and face tomorrow. I have always had trouble falling asleep since childhood. I just don’t know how to destress, I just want to feel okay and neutral tonight.

I don’t know what to do, I wish I could shut my brain off and disassociate. I either go in between crying due to getting overwhelmed thinking about how scared and lonely I feel; or I doom scroll election results and tiktok hoping to feel some sense of comfort. I deleted google and anything else related to election results as I just can’t handle it. All of my diagnoses tend to feed off each other, as you can see lol. I have laid down in bed for a few hours now trying to sleep, and I just can’t. 

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions to help? I don’t know much about my CPTSD as im new to learning about my diagnosis and coping mechanisms. Im also starting with a new therapist this week (thank goodness). Has anything helped anyone calm down or get rid of the hopelessness/dread feeling? I know I need to sleep and I have tried, but I just cry.

I hope you are all holding up okay despite what has happened tonight. I am sending all my love. And to all the women, BIPOC, and LGBTQIA+ communities, I send my whole soul with love as I know how scary and lonely it might feel tonight.",anxiety
"i took magnesium and it gave me anxiety  i appreciate all of the advice that people give on here, but this is a reminder to take things with a grain of salt and that everyone is different. i did some reading on taking the supplement after seeing so many people saying that they took magnesium and it ""saved their life"" and ""im a completely different person""

bought some magnesium bisglycinate because i've been exercising more frequently and thought it'd be a better option for me. took it at around 7pm with dinner, and 2 hours later it felt like my anxiety was ramping up, but it passed within 1 minute, so i brushed it off because i thought it was because ive been more tired than usual. i got ready for bed and tried to go to sleep, but jesus christ did it do a number on me lol

i lay there for an hour trying to sleep but i had the worst clamminess and hotness ive had in years. i couldn't get comfortable... i fell asleep for an hour and woke up to the same thing. i was about ready to call 911 for the first time in my life. i didn't feel like it was a full blown panic attack, my heart wasn't racing, and my mind wasn't racing with terrible thoughts, i was just cold/sweating/scared. i'm in canada, so i messaged 811 instead, who told me to visit a doctor within 24 hours, drink lots of clear fluids and juice, and lay with my legs elevated for an hour. i didn't get any good sleep at all lol i think i was waking up every hour because of how uncomfortable i felt.

i felt a little h better waking up the next day, but i was anxious about what happened the night before, i hesitantly booked an appointment at a walk-in clinic where i got to talk to a doctor and get my blood drawn. the doctor themselves said ""that's weird, magnesium usually does the opposite"". i came home and did some more reading, and found that if magnesium imbalances calcium levels, it can cause anxiety! anyways, i came home and repeated the same routine i did the night before minus the magnesium, and knocked out for 8 hours straight. maybe it was me being exhausted, maybe not 

my anxiety levels to begin with were manageable, and i do take other supplements with no problem. this was just a good reminder not to jump the gun at a hopeful ""this saved my life"" story. everyone's different, and i know a good number of people on here are apprehensive about going to the doctor to check their deficiencies before taking something you can buy from anywhere, but please do!

"Empathy, people pleasing & boundaries Hello y‘all. 

So I just want to share my story and how I am slowly recovering from having social anxiety, erytrophobia and a crippling insomnia. Leading me to a point where I couldn‘t go on anymore. I needed change but I couldn‘t change until I realized something about myself. 

The thing is this: I am way too empathetic. I can relate to people extremely well, positive and negative. Empathy is something great, but for me it was a trained survival strategy. Let me explain:

I grew up in an unstable household, to say the least: My father was an alcoholic and always went violent when he drank. He never hit me (luckily) but my mother once and almost broke my brothers arm. My parents would fight a lot. Shouting, screaming, slamming doors. My mom cried a lot and really loud. My dad would spend his evenings in our basement, drinking one bottle after another. One day I went to the basement and I saw some torn rope hanging from a pipe on the ceiling. It was way too thin but 9 year old me could only imagine he tried to hang himself. But I cant be certain today. My father moved out at some point. Fast forward a couple of months and actually I felt like my parents relationship getting better. My father visited more often and the mood was okay. Then one fateful day, when I thought everything would be okay again, my father died. 

I didnt go to school for sometime afterwards. But when I eventually went back, I was really happy to see my friends and classmates again. To just have some normal time for once. But of course the school knew and of course the teachers talked to the other kids about why I wasnt there for some weeks. So everybody knew. There was no more normality for me. I didn‘t feel safe at home and I felt like the odd one out at school. But I just wanted to fit in and feel safe. So to navigate this mess I learned the amazing skill of empathy. I learned how others felt in certain situations so I could adjust myself to that. I acted in ways to not offend anybody, to not risk exclusion or that someone might be upset with me and I would feel in danger again like when I did with my alcoholic father.

Reading others and adjusting my behavior to that became my survival strategy. And it worked. I always got along with everyone but only because I became a people pleaser. This behavior deepened and I developed social anxiety. I even was anxious around people I loved. I could not upset them, or else they might leave me. So I thought. But in this process I lost myself. I always felt like a social chameleon. Always adjusting to others and their needs, never being myself. 

I struggled for almost 20 years. Only currently I discovered that I am „using“ my empathy wrong. I stopped second guessing my actions and thinking about how others reacted or might react to future actions. I started to set boundaries, especially for myself. I always felt connected to others, but it got too much. I need more separation. 

Empathy is amazing, don‘t get me wrong. Its enabling us to build deep and lasting relationships and to help people in need. But taken too far it just backfires. Too much of a good thing is still too much. Especially if you lack the ability to set healthy boundaries. I needed to learn to look out for myself. Since realizing this I feel way calmer, especially in social settings, my insomnia is slowly improving and even my digestion. I overall feel like myself again. It wasn‘t just an epiphany and I was cured. It took me a long time to get me where I am. But I learned that I get to decide how I behave, what I say and what I do. I don‘t need everybodies approval and I don‘t need everybody to like me. 

Thank you for reading.

"Health anxiety  Hi, i’m trying not to panic rn but i am having some health related anxiety. 
I had a breast aug a week ago. I went in for my checkup Monday and they were obviously concerned and ended up telling me i had a hematoma. my right one underneath and on my side just looks brutal and gets a lot worse everyday. i mean it is huge and so dark purple. its scaring me watching it get so much worse every time i look at it. it’s currently 3am for me and i go back into surgery to get it drained at 2pm. i’ve never had one of these and just a little bit ago i started to feel it throbbing and then started having other weird feelings around my chest, my head started to hurt, then my whole body felt like how it usually does during a panic attack so im just all over the place now. i want to sleep so bad but it hurts and i’m so uncomfortable and now that im nearly having a panic attack i wouldn’t be able to so now i am here. 🥲 
Have any of you had bad hematomas before? can you tell me i’m not gonna die? Thanks in advance 🫶🏻 i’d post a pic of it but i don’t think anyone would want to see that lol. I just gotta make it however many more hours till they can drain this thing. ",anxiety

"Anxiety about having breast cancer  
i was diagnosed with anxiety about 3 years ago. i have never been medicated and my therapy was cut short. i have only recently joined this reddit because i find my anxiety fluctuates between controllable and spiraling. 

im searching for comfort because, like many of you, one of my main things with anxiety is being a hypochondriac. i get super worried about having breast cancer. there's a variety of cancers at least coming from my mom's side. she has one aunt that was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent surgery to remove the tumor. 

months ago, i found a lump in my armpit. it was painful and pretty noticeable. i scheduled an appointment right away and went to get it looked at and the doctor could not find it. because of this, they canceled my ultrasound. i felt awful and like i had wasted their time. but sure enough, the lump was gone. today, i have a rash on my breast. it's somewhat itchy, it's red/pink, it's bumpy. however, it is spotting a tiny bit on my other breast and it seems to also be a small spot on my stomach. i made the mistake of using the internet and it seems like one of the first symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer is a rash. i don't know what to do. im petrified. if anybody knows anything, i appreciate your insight. there's no pain, no swelling or pitting or inversion. it's all the same but with a rash.

"Terrible anaphylaxis and MCAS fear taking over my life - I never head food allergy in my life Recently, after reading about MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome), I developed severe OCD and health anxiety about having anaphylactic shock and potentially dying. Since Covid I have developed POTS, I read that MCAS is often associated with it. I realized that since I was younger I couldn't tolerate car air fresheners, stopped tolerating alcohol well and I went DEEP DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE. 
Every time I eat, I become terrified, I look for signs of allergy and think I'm dying. I am even scared to eat foods I've been eating my whole life. I’ve never had a food allergy, but I do have GERD and LPR, and my voice goes hoarse often or I get mucus after eating. I also experience a tight throat snd palpitations,  which the doctor said it is due to acid reflux.
 I wanted to ask, what are the odds of someone like me - 30 years old that never had a good allergy to develop anaphylaxis and die from it? Has anyone had this terrible fear?

"Is there something the doctor could do about this? So normally, I don't really have anxiety much at all. But when I do, It's REALLY bad!

To understand why it's so bad. You need to understand, I've been really depressed. Very apathetic towards life. Not sad. Just extremely indifferent. Ive gone back and forth and back and forth on why I'm like this. I'm really strongly starting to believe that Trazodone is playing a huge part in it.

My depression is at it's worse in the morning with me being emotionally blunted and feeling like I can't walk straight. The grogginess goes away after an hour or two, but the emotional bluntness stays.

It's not until like 12 hours after I wake up. I start to behave differently. I'm way more interested in what im doing and even put off going to bed because I actually feel happy!
Looking up grogginess and trazodone on reddit, You'll see alot of other people complain about the same thing im dealing with in the morning. I tried an experiment a few months back with trazodone where I only took 12.5mg's for 20 days to see if i start feeling better. While I didn't notice anything. I swear it has to be trazodone! I can't find any other plausible reason as to why this is happening to me. And so... I want to make a real effort to be off trazodone for at least 2 months to really make sure if it's responsible for my severe morning depression.

There's just one problem...
Whenever I have a really bad night of sleep. There's a chance I'll get this really really bad anxiety attack during the afternoon. It's so bad that I can't think straight. Worse is because I have so little interest in things outside of youtube and daydreaming, I have a really hard time destracting myself.

Is there something the doctor could give me that I could take whenever something like this happens? If you go through my reddit history. Ive made sooooooooooooo many posts about having anxiety attacks over the past 3 years. All relating to sleep. This is so uncomfortable I hate it!!!",anxiety
"Health Anxiety About Hauntavirus About a week ago, my family found out we had a mouse infestation in our house, and we decided to go clean. It took us a while, but we are done now, and seem to have gotten the infestation under better control. The biggest problem is though, we are all feeling sick, so that led to me searching about Hauntavirus. While I’ve heard of it before, I thought it was kind of one of those things you could only get if you literally ate mouse excrements, but BOY WAS I WRONG. That’s when I realized my family has made a grave mistake. You aren’t supposed to sweep/vacuum mice nests and droppings because Hauntavirus is AIRBORNE, and doing so stirs up the Hauntavirus into the air. We are all sick in a similar way. I have always had bad health anxiety, but this is next level. I was even planning out what to do if I end up dying because the mortality rate is so high. I’m terrified I’m going to lose my parents. The other thing is, the incubation time for this virus is up to 2 months, so I have to wait over 2 months to feel safe again. I’ve never felt this scared in my life. I live in a state where it is not common at all, with a total of 6 documented cases ever, but I can’t stop telling myself my family is about to add 4 more to it. I have a therapy appointment tomorrow where I’ll be talking about this, but I just don’t know how I’m supposed to get through this, especially since we are all sick. I’m also on antibiotics right now for a UTI and I can’t tell how much symptoms are from that and the side effects of antibiotics, and what is sickness/possible hauntavirus. I’m terrified. ",anxiety

"Heart palpitations  Ever since high school my brain became hyper stimulated. I think it was due to long nights of studying and eventually I had a panic attack. For the next few months I couldn’t sleep and I had a few more panic attacks like waking up in the middle of the night with anxiety that caused my heart to race really fast and then calm down. I called 911 a couple of times thinking I was going to die. 

Fast forward I was on anti depressants to ease my anxiety and I can say that all my symptoms went away for the entire time I took them but I eventually got off of them because I no longer wanted to be dependent on medication .

Recently I woke up in the middle of the night and thought that something was stuck in my chest (not really pain) and my anxiety took over and I started panicking. Then all was well for the next few weeks but before I have panic attacks there’s always a trigger e.g I stayed up studying the night before . Which is what I did like 2 week backs and due to my brain always being hyper stimulated I can’t sleep for the next few nights (I close my eyes but I’m aware of everything) now I’ve become more aware of my heart palpitations my cardio phobia is at an all time high . I don’t think it’s anything major because I played like 3 hours of basketball and my palpitations literally went away that night and I felt great but my palpitations came back the next few days. 

I’m no doctor but I feel like my lack of quality sleep has contributed to this. My brain doesn’t fall asleep for a while until each panic attack is over idk I’m just really afraid and scared for my life. I’m most likely going to visit a doctor but I feel like bawling my eyes out I hate this shit so much. I have moments where I feel amazing and I also have moments where I feel scared for my life. I really hope there’s nothing wrong with my heart I don’t like being hyper aware of my palpitations at all.",anxiety

"school anxiety I’ve had anxiety for a while now. I’ve never gotten diagnosed with it, but once you’ve had it for so long, you know. I’m really thinking about switching to homeschool; but I’m not sure if I should. I stress over almost anything, but one thing I’ve been really stressing about lately is school. For some reason school makes me so anxious. Everyday I have to mentally prepare myself before I go to school, or else I will have a mental breakdown and cry. I try to go into it with a positive mindset but sometimes it doesn’t work. Some days, my anxiety is mild (which is very rare) and most days I feel physically sick to my stomach, or sometimes I will feel dizzy. I really don’t know what causes this anxiety, I really think it’s a social thing. I’m scared of embarrassing myself in public. The thing is, I never feel this way in any other places other than school. Sure, sometimes I get anxious talking to strangers but my anxiety has never been this bad anywhere outside of school. Sometimes I wish I didn’t have to be in such a big classroom, and i wish I could work alone, like one on one with a teacher and that’s how I got my education. Being around so many people everyday just makes me so overwhelmed. I’ve talked about this with my mom and she just told me I’ll grow out of it. I’m not sure I will. I’ve had it for 5 years and I still haven’t gotten rid of it. I know I will never get rid of general anxiety, but when is it gonna stop being so excruciating? I don’t really know what to do. My mom said she wants to take me to the doctor and maybe that will make me feel better. Honestly I think the best option for me is doing homeschooling or something.

"Question: full breath only when on Xanax Background: I’m 30m. I grew up in the culty-er side of Christianity. One of the many things I internalized was that anxiety and worry were sinful - so I have only recently (past 2-3 years) been able to start noticing, acknowledging, and processing the anxiety that has plagued me my whole life rather than calling it stress. 

I’m learning a lot as I try to be more in touch with my body and aware of how this all is affecting me

I’ve recently noticed that when I take a Xanax, I get to breathe deeply. Not just take deep breaths, but fill my lungs. 

When I am not taking it, I can take a deep breath, do box breathing, etc. But it feels like I can fill 20% more in a breath when I take my meds

I don’t even know if this makes sense, but if it does, I would love to hear folks’ thoughts, feedback, or just similar experiences. Is this just a signal that I am anxious all the time? Are there other physical signals I should be paying attention to?

"Any advice for ppl with health anixety? I'm 19f, I never had health anixety growing up. When I turned 18 I got a job as a secuity guard. My shift was at a homeless shelter and this lady had a cute puppy. The puppy was very excited to see me and she ended up scraping her teeth against my hand, which caused swelling and redness. 

I didn't have any type of medical insurance at the time so I couldn't exactly afford to get it checked out. I starred completely overthinking it, thinking I was gonna get rabies. I told my dad how I felt and he completely brushed me off. I generally thought I was gonna die and I ended up writing ""goodbye"" letters to my family just in case. (Bit dramatic) 

After I finally convinced myself that I didn't have rabies, I thought it was finally over. Until i moved out of my dad's house, and moved in with my biological mother. (She's helped so much and understands me) I used to smoke weed everyday, until one day I smoked and I ended up getting an ice pick headache right after. I thought it was a thunderclap headache, and convinced myself I was gonna die. I went to the er and got a CT scan, and blood work. They said everything is perfectly fine. I still don't understand why I got an ice pick headache. Maybe stress? During that time I wasn't sleeping good at all. I'm not sure.


I've been to the ER at least 5-6 times in the last two months because I'm always convincing myself that I am dying from some horrible disease. They run blood tests and they said I'm fine. And that it's my anxiety. I know deep down I'm perfectly healthy, but It's like my anixety is constantly saying ""You're gonna die, something is wrong."" And if i have ANY symptoms I google them and come across things that I convince myself I have. 


My uncle passed away from esophageal cancer last year, he didn't have a healthy lifestyle, he did hard drugs and drank alcohol. They believe that's what caused it, but I am TERRIFIED that it's genetic. No one else is my family has had it except him, my mom has told me there is no history of genetic medical conditions of any sort in our family, and she tries to remind me that it's just my anixety. 


I have IBS, and anytime I get a stomach pain, or acid reflux, I always assume it's esophageal cancer now. The last few days I've been obsessing over this. My anixety wants me to get an endoscopy, but I'm trying to be reasonable with myself. I have literally no symptoms. 


I just feel like I'm going crazy. Once I go to the doctor and get tests done for the thing im worried about, I just start obsessing over something else on my body. I'm so tired of it. I don't know how to convince myself that nothing is wrong with me.

I was diagnosed with stress related Asthma once but haven't shown any symptoms for way over 5 years. And then it started with very very slight trouble ""getting enough air"" and it got worse and worse.  
It got so bad, I sometimes experience panic attacks that are very extreme. They last for up to 5 hours and once I fell unconcious. Aside from those relatively rare extreme ones, I have panic attacks almost every single day. I mostly manage to survive them with some deep breaths and focussing on something I usually enjoy.  It still remains a pretty exhausting endeavor and sometimes I just feel like giving up because it just is too much at times. I'm almost afraid of going to sleep.  This shit is like an Ouroboros.  Lack of sleep makes it worse =higher chance of extreme or more frequent panic attacks= less sleep.. anyways..   thanks for listening, I guess.  

I am currently still waiting on therapy spots, so that stuff is in progress.  Just wanted to share my struggle because apparently it helps a little bit knowing you are not alone and transforming what you feel into words. I just hope this doesn't trigger anyone.  ",anxiety

"Dental Pain Hey Reddit, 

  
Was having dental pain for a little while on my right side of my teeth - went away. I decided to do a CT scan at the ER as well as an x-ray at the dentist. No issues whatsoever. A week later, pain came back. Currently pain is gone right now. But do have a little bit of a stiff neck, very small fever (37.5 Celsius) but no pain in my mouth. 

Any cause for concern? This has been going on for a little while and when I read on it - sometimes can get crazy. ",anxiety
"Buspirone  Hello! I’m just wondering how long buspirone took to work for everyone, and any experiences on it. For context I’m on 5mg twice daily for now, for anxiety and panic attacks. ",anxiety
"Anxiety gotten somewhat worse  I’ve always been a nervous person. But a couple years ago I had a serious of anxiety attacks that led to one big panic attack. It was new to me and I had never experienced something so intense and scary. It definitely has changed me. I was doing really well until I had the flu in April of this year. Weirdly, it’s made me feel more panicky about my health. 

I had the full nine yards. Lately coming out both ends. I haven’t puked since I was a kid and when I got sick that night it was so unexpected. And not to be dramatic but the feeling is like non forgettable. lol. Like puking. I’d rather have diarrhea x10 than puke lmao. Imo puking is like the worst feeling ever. Obviously nobody enjoys it!

Anyways! So then I’m more nervous of like having my stomach hurt. Like wondering if I’m going to be sick. Especially at work it can be bad. Like working myself up to the point where I feel like I could puke. Or thinking what if I can’t breath. And that gives my the sensation of thinking I’m on the brink of puking.  I never do, all because I’m paranoid. I was doing much better until a couple nights ago I had really bad diarrhea and again, thought I was going to puke. Next day at work I felt anxious and barely ate. No appetite. All because I’m worried. When in reality I’m totally healthy. Then in the night I wake up feeling really sick to my stomach and thought I was going to puke. Like I’m always working up into these scenarios. Then it makes me exhausted the next day because I’m just emotionally drained. So last few days have been getting back to managing it again. 

So many people just would not understand what it’s like to go through this. Like there’s such a difference between being someone who can be nervous than someone who’s got anxiety. Because I feel like my day to day life is just ran by it and I have very little control. 

I always know when I have an attack because it’s such an indescribable feeling. I’m sure it’s different for everyone. But it’s like this tingly sensation crawling up my neck and up through my head. 

I know people have it worse than me. But dealt like sharing. ",anxiety

"3 month long health anxiety flare-up: going insane. I'm tired and I need advice/reassurance/whatever. i'm driving myself and my parents insane over this and i feel so stupid and dumb and crazy. i've cried like 3 times this week alone.

For some background, what started out as a visit to a traumatologist in late august to finally determine what was causing my chronic headaches + neck and shoulder pain has turned into a three month-long health anxiety spiral for me with tons of weird symptoms that come and go and wax and wane as they please and i honestly don't know why or how to stop it. To recap:

1. First it was my usual combo of headaches + neck/shoulder pain that didn't seen to get any better with the treatment plan the doctor gave me, alongside weird zapping/wet sensations in my scalp (like water running down your scalp). This lasted until around mid-september probably. I still get the pain everyday but the weird sensations in my head have mostly stopped.
2. Starting early october i got a weird case of nausea where every morning i would get nauseous and puke only in the morning before and after eating breakfast, mostly water and my breakfast alongisde some diarrhea, bloating and most persistently, a strange feeling of being lightheaded. Not dizzy, more like, having my head literally in the clouds, feeling faint and hazy. We went to our family doctor and got some medicine that alleviated the nausea and vomiting, i told him about the weird head feeling but he said it was most likely fatigue from vomiting. Despite this, to this day the weird head feeling still remains and sometimes it turns into a weird pressure that envolves my whole scalp + neck/traps or a regular headache. i've noticed it gets much better at night. The nausea also comes and goes.

Now, the head feeling isn't particularly distruptive or anything, at least compared to how it was at the start. I can still think, go outside and get stuff done and pretend i'm fine and dandy. But it's been almost a month since the initial flare-up and the fact it hasn't gone away nor significantly worsened nor eased and consistently gets better at night makes me feel very uneasy.  I'm trying to tell myself it's most likely my anxiety playing tricks on me because i can't stop thinking about it (and i do have a history of somatizing symptoms) but no matter how hard i try to stop myself from overthinking and thkning its something more serious. my mind keeps alternating between thinking i have a brain tumor or iih, even though realistically it's impossible, if i had these i'd literally be bedridden and unable to form a coherent thought, let alone talk or think or write this reddit post, but it's so hard. i don't remember how i used to feel before. It's like my body forgot how i used to feel before my health anxiety flare-up started. I feel so scared and lonely.

What's not helping my anxiety in the slightest is the fact i feel like a burden to my parents. They try to be supportive but they can't hide the fact they're getting kinda tired of hearing me complaing everyday ab out a new ailment. And i understand that, i really do, but i'm just desperate. i'm used to always bottling up how i feel. I just want them to listen and comfort me without me feeling guilty about it and withotu them complaining ab out it later. Complicating things further is that we live in a third world country where the healthcare system is an absolute joke and medicine is, if not super expensive, non-existent. A week ago my aunt when to a government funded doctor's office because she had a headache from hypertension and the doctor told her, verbatim ""just take some water with salt and you'll feel better"".

At least not all news are bad. Earlier today i went to uni with some nausea and had a free eye exam just to assuage my fears of having iih. the exam only found out i had myopia in my right eye, but i'm still nervous and anxious. i  finally told my mom about the weird head pressure and my fears about having iih. she laughed at me and said i was too young to worry about such things, but at least she was supportive and said i should get an mri sometime and another more comprehensive eye exam. we've also scheduled a therapy appointment to see if i can finally get diagnosed. fingers crossed i can go back to normal again...

"October is cursed for me. I have a story and would love advice.  I am diagnosed with G.A.D, Schizophrenia, and some physical stuff that causes seizures. I have been seeing a psych for 5 years and am medicated for everything. The most pressing medication is my Benz as is so often the case. For 4 years I took Ativ at 7mg a day with about 4 other medications. 

The treatment is great. From the ashes of mania and pain I rebuilt my life. I have a happy marriage, a stable job, and a decent life. While you can never defeat anxiety you can get the upper hand in the life long fight. Ok story time

Earlier this month my wife's tire blew up on the highway while I was at work. She was near to the town we grew up in where her parents live and I was 1.5 hours away. I offered to head her way but her dad had volunteered and was much closer. An hour later she is still on the side of a VERY busy highway at night. So I rush out to help and as I arrive her dad arrives. The spare tire had been put on but her dad wanted to back her car down an off ramp to get to a gas station so he could check the other tires. The man is a control freak and extremely abusive.  I wanted to get us off the highway so I told her dad to shove it and tried to snag the keys. He responded by throwing a punch and trying to fight me which I refused to do given we were literally 6 inches from an active highway. In this process, he shoved my wife, his daughter, into traffic and I ran in to yank her out. He left without a word and we went home. The next day, my wife lost her job. She is a surgical technician in training and this was a huge loss. Then after a hurried emergency at my work I got a week's worth of my Benz and Seroquel stolen from my car. Who steals Seroquel? 

Given the stress I was struggling to sleep, being paranoid, and all that jazz. So I took an extra 2mg of my Benz as I have done on very rare occasions in the past (last done in August 2023). I figured the doc would understand and also given my stolen medication, all would be well. The doctor DID NOT understand. 

My doctor has wanted to taper to a lower dose for some time and I have taper down by about 30% over a year. That is slow granted but also I do need this medical mentally and physically. I ran totally out of medication on Tuesday and had to go to the ER and get treated like trash which was great. My doctor vanished and then I guess came in on a day off to talk to me. His response was ""this isn't working for me"" and ""I am done with you"" and he told me to seek detox. His final words were that I love complication so I'd like an overly strict detox program after hanging up. 

I looked into detox and it won't work. 

1. I need this medication. I understand that Benz is not a great long-term medication but I have seizures, paranoia, and anxiety that is so bad most doctors won't treat me. 
2. Going cold turkey, even in a detox program, has a success rate of about 1%. The rate of you know what is like 32% in one study. 
3. The program cost around 10k with insurance and I do not have 10k. My wife is still in school and I cannot just sell my car, quit my job, empty our savings, rob a bank (kidding but you get the point), and abandon her for a month. I'd rather her cash in on life insurance 

I am trying to find a doctor and cannot. 

Now here is what's funny. So when my Doctor called out of the blue he sent over Klonopen for me as an alternative, a medication I have had bad experiences with. While I dislike it still it actually works. I am sleeping, my anxiety is way lower. I think this has completed my treatment finally, right as my doctor decided I am evil. 

What the heck do I do? Keep in mind I have no criminal record, I don't drink, I have no history of medication abuse, and so on. I cannot seem to find a new doctor either though I am really trying. 

Anyone have bad experiences with doctors like this? How did you handle it? What would you do if you were me? Sorry for the long post. I am a writer and a long winded one at that. ",anxiety
"Tips to get rid of chest/body anxiety after mental anxiety has already passed  I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life and have managed it through therapy and meditation. One thing I can’t seem to get a handle on is getting my body to calm down after an intense emotional experience.

For example, yesterday I ran into a man who ghosted me. I felt anxious and talked it out with friends, which helped mentally, but today my chest is still tight and tense. Even though I’m not thinking about it anymore, my body feels stuck in “danger” mode.  Small moments (like literally maybe 2 minutes) of high anxiety in one day can throw my body off, and therefore me, for an entire week.

"Severe anxiety I’ve been a wreck for these past 3 weeks and I think I have severe undiagnosed anxiety. Before I talk about what’s been going on recently, I want to clarify that I’ve had symptoms of anxiety from the ages of 8 years old (I’m now 16). 

My first experience with anxiety was when I had to get a brain scan, I remember them putting the cap on my head and me shitting myself as I thought they were going to literally fry my brain and kill me. I then started experiencing severe derealisation episodes at the age of 9, they often started at very specific times, 6PM to be exact, along with paranoia, and panic attacks from my own delusions, I was petrified of sleeping at night as I thought someone would break in, or I would just simply die in my sleep. Eventually around the ages of 10 or 11, my derealisation became constant and never stopped, I still have it to this day BUT it varies in severity, meaning sometimes it’s very light, or severe. 

That being said, around 3 weeks ago I was laying in bed at around 9PM when all of a sudden I got a wave of severe derealisation and just felt like my brain was “not right”, everything suddenly felt very unfamiliar and alien, this feeling of discomfort then quickly spiralled into a panic attack which lasted the entire night. During the panic attack I was shaking (literally looked like I was seizing), had diarrhoea 3 times, was urinating constantly, had throat congestion, jelly legs, manual breathing, a sudden extreme fear of dying and most of the physical symptoms associated with a panic attack. 

I literally lost my mind, I mean, I was pacing around the room repeating to myself that I was going to die, and was rocking back and forth in bed desperately trying to soothe myself. I eventually fell asleep at around 6AM, but when I woke up the next day, the derealisation did not go away at all, and I was extremely fatigued. Later on, I had another 2 panic attacks which caused the most horrendous physical symptoms, I urinated atleast 10 times and had diarrhoea 5 times. 

On day 3, I was riddled with fear and depression. The moment I woke up, I vomited 4 times, and was extremely fatigued. I went to my local healthcare clinic and had a huge panic attack, and requested an urgent GP appointment. Whilst I was freaking out in the waiting room, I was picking and biting at my lips to the point there was blood dripping off my chin, on top of that I had dirty, unbrushed hair, pale skin, dark under eyes, and pjs on. I looked and felt like a mess. The first urgent GP appointment didn’t do anything, I was just given a self referral service for talking therapy, which I couldn’t access anyways because I was under the age of 17. By then I lost count of days I was experiencing this constant agony, all I remember is 2+ panic attacks a day, until I got another urgent GP appointment, this time I got lucky and was given propranolol, which helped but still gave me anxiety as they lower your blood pressure, it also did not help my derealisation. 

I experienced 2 weeks of debilitating panic attacks, on my last day of having them, I actually hallucinated. I remember suddenly falling to the floor and shaking uncontrollably, I felt my throat inflating, my chest compressing, my entire body going numb, and the impending doom washing over me. A few minutes into my panic attack, I look at my smoke detector which was in the middle of 4 kitchen lights, and I thought it was an angel coming to collect my soul. I took my propranolol and fell asleep at around 7AM, and from there had no panic attacks. 
However, I was instead hit with extreme fatigue, I was literally bed bound from the moment I woke up, I was extremely depressed and mentally drained, it also felt like (and still feels like) I was braindead, I had such bad brain fog, I was literally forgetting thoughts I had moments ago, I also had trouble reading and processing things, and creating logical arguments in my head/scenarios. I was absolutely miserable. 
My anxiety didn’t fully disappear either, it was just the panic attacks, so I still felt the impending doom, fear of dying, and tension. 

I also forgot to mention that I completely lost sense of time, so things that I did a day ago felt like a week ago. 
Anyways, I’m still in a depressed and anxious state, I cant get out of bed until 12PM, I’m also unable to go to college or just outside in general, but I’m able to dress myself and maintain good hygiene. I never thought how bad my mental state could get, I was in college 3 weeks ago and I was absolutely fine, and now I’m a zombie, can anyone else relate?? I hope I can survive this.",anxiety

"How to stop compulsive overthinking?  I don’t even know if this is a thing. I am an over thinker and always have been but usually when I need to focus on something like when studying for an exam I could stop and concentrate when I want to even though sometimes an idea would pop in my head and distract me for a few minutes until I “resolve” that idea and quickly get back to studying. This doesn’t waste too much time (7-10 minutes at best and doesn’t happen that frequently so it is like a small break). Now, the issue I am facing currently started recently when I had a misunderstanding with a couple of close friends, which kinda cause us to distance ourselves from each other temporarily (we all believe that it is just a misunderstanding and no one is at fault and temporary distancing we think should be healthy). This is where my problems began. I was the one that suggested we distance a bit so I felt like I destroyed the friend group (I had to distance long story short I fell in love with someone in the group that I could never be with the pain was too much so I had to do this). Anyways, whenever I see them all without me, I fall to pieces and I can’t stop thinking about it to the point that it takes me half an hour and SO MUCH BRAIN ENERGY (I feel very tired afterwards, it is like squeezing your brain so that it doesn’t space out) just to read a single sentence and I wouldn’t even be satisfied with it as I would have multiple thoughts in between this half an hour (so I read two hours, the thought comes back, I take a few minutes suppressing it, then two words, repeat). When this happens I stop studying and take a break that spans a few days (I think I only need 3-4 hours but when you take break unexpectedly and your plan is ruined, especially as a perfectionist straight A college student, the disappointment kills you and you sink deeper and grow apathetic until a few days have gone and now you don’t wanna fail). This only ever happens to me rarely, when there is an external trigger (weird dynamics with my friends now). It makes me seriously wanna die :). Any idea if this is anxiety or if not what else it could be? The kind of thoughts I would get are along the lines of “could I have done this differently”, “was I in the wrong”, “could I do more to fix this”, “maybe I should send more messages”, “no no I don’t wanna come off as annoying” and with this overthinking comes a suffocating chest tightness (I think only for the first couple hours from the trigger).",anxiety

"Huge mistake, lessons learned, but still spiraling in my head I got diagnosed with chronic anxiety and depression just few days ago. And I’m still in a little denial/and or confused.

This morning though… I had the worst episode and my mind was spiraling in negative thoughts. I knew I wasn’t ok and I was overthinking unusually…But I couldn’t stop myself.

My instinct was to call my childhood acquaintance who I haven’t spoken for many many years. For some reason, I dumped all my everything I had in mind. I cut off our catchups and conversations and asked if I could be honest…I just couldn’t stop myself.

I knew I fucked up. I even dumped my marriage concerns and I regret it awfully right now. They were kind to me…but I knew I messed up. 

I decided to find a therapy/counselor/psychiatrist. I’ve already emailed my doctor for a confirmation to get help. 

NOW…I just spent good 5hours not being able to move. Regretting the call. I wish I had a therapist sooner so it was the therapist I called not someone I knew years and years ago. Idk.

"High heart rate *causing* anxiety, can’t take beta blockers? So for like ten years now I’ve suffered with random tachycardia episodes. PVCs and PAC’s started at the same time, too. Ten years ago. 

Anyway. When I try taking the lowest dose of beta blocker (bisoprolol) it lowers my heart rate too much when I sleep and also, it lowers my blood pressure too. I didn’t need my blood pressure lowered. 

My tachycardia has been ruled out for many years as just being ‘random’ and maybe IST? And for a very long time I just ignored it and got on with my life. Had another baby even (that’s how un-anxious I am as a person haha).

However…. Fast forward to now, the random tachycardia episodes have increased and are just getting on my nerves. It worsens when I’m just relaxing in the couch in the evenings, and then ramps up even more when I lay down in bed and try to sleep. It’ll increase from 75 to 90-110 just laying there. THEN I start getting anxious about it.

So now. I’m not sure what I’m meant to do? I am currently trying to conceive again and so don’t see the point in NOW starting meds (I’m currently on NONE) if I know I’d need to stop them due to pregnancy and breastfeeding…

"Chest and Left Arm Discomfort Hi everyone. To preface, I am a 25 year old male.

I have always struggled with anxiety throughout my life, but it has been a much more prominent part of my life over the last year or so.

This past January, I had two separate stints in the ER because of chest pain and other symptoms that resembled a heart attack. I had several EKGs, and even an Echocardiogram and everything came back perfectly normal. One instance included extreme chest pain and numbness/tingling in my left arm.

Over the past year, I have started to take Buspar for my anxiety. Things have been fairly normal lately, until last night. I did not get a single second of sleep last night because of this extreme “burning” sensation I had in my chest. And, my left arm felt very numb once again.

I never once considered that left arm discomfort could be tied to anxiety, but after reviewing this page I see that several people have experienced this.

If I had not gone to the ER and had the Echocardiogram done earlier this year, I would already be at the ER getting re-checked out. One of the most notable elements of my anxiety has been an increased element of health anxiety. I have been to the urgent care and received blood work around 5 times this year already. My heart rate has not been below 100 bpm all day.

Has anyone experienced these chest pains and left arm discomfort before and how did you resolve it? Since these symptoms mirror a possible heart attack, I am extremely frightened. Thank you!

"Ongoing health issues for 6 months  (32M) Starting about 6 months ago I was having strange pain around my xiphoid process and my lower ribs.. pain was not severe but consistent for months. I took omeprazole for a month since my doctor thought I might have a stomach ulcer, but when the pain didn’t get better I was referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. I had an endoscopy performed on August 6th (everything came out clear) but the following day I had a very strange dizziness/unsteady feeling, my body felt heavy/weak, and I had moments of body tingling, fatigue and nausea. I figured it was from the anesthesia since I had never had it before, but I am 3 months out from my procedure and it’s continued to happen everyday. Since then I’ve had multiple blood panels, a brain MRI, and abdominal/pelvic and chest CT, a heart sologram, wore a heart monitor for 3 days and have yet to find any answer to my problems. My doctors believes that it’s anxiety/depression related since I’ve had history of panic attacks and worry very frequently, but this just feels so much different than what I’ve felt in the past. I just want to feel like myself again and my doctor is pushing towards antidepressants, but I don’t feel that depressed.. just very worried that I have something wrong with me because what I’m feeling is very real. If I didn’t feel these physical symptoms, I really don’t think I would have any issues. I had a very good friend of mine pass away 4 days before my procedure, so I believe my doctor is basing all my issues off that, but I really believe there is something going on with me. Life has been hell and i’m hoping to find someone who has also dealt with issues like this, and if antidepressants helped with recovery. ",anxiety

"My life feels like hell since I have anxiety... I (19F) barely experienced intense or chronic anxiety my whole childhood or teenagehood (even tho I had one panic attack in high school it was really something punctual).

But after an intense summer of working and spending the last two weeks in a horrible heartbreak (he cheated on me) and then brutally changing environment from the fresh air of mountains to the grey and depressive Paris, I felt so exhausted and overwhelmed by everything I wanted to stop my theatre classes after the second class I took. I felt like an incapable trash and each day going by I just kept telling myself that life is too hard for me to handle. And for the first time in life, I had suicidal thoughts that weren't just intrusive... And since I felt like they were tangible, I panicked and had a huge panic attack. 

Since that exact moment, I've started feeling anxiety. Strong anxiety. And it was even more scary because I felt like everything I ever knew changed.

Before, I used to escape in my head, focusing on what was coming next to survive the moment I was leaving. But now looking forward to the future really makes me uncomfortable and it felt like I lost my only way to cope.

Since I have anxiety, everything seems bleak, hard and my self-esteem is buried in the ground. It's so hard dealing with panic attack so often, intense one at that. Especially since I didn't have them before.

I have medication for anxiety but that doesn't really help at all. 

What helps me is someone being there and supporting me, but because of that, I feel like a huge burden, especially because my ""best friend"" is super mean to me in the moments I need her most.

I mean, last time I called the samu (a french helping line that can get you an ambulance as well as just put you in touch with a doctor) because I had such a huge headache I couldn't handle it, but they were so mean to me because I wasn't able to find the address so they ironically made fun of my ""stupidity"" and put me on the longest waiting list he could have put me on. That made me panic I had a huge panic attack I was trying to hide but couldn't. She came to me and asked me what was wrong I told her briefly about the samu thing and the only thing she found to tell me was ""That's normal they got angry we don't call the samu for that"" I was like ??? And then she tried to tell me it was ridiculous wanting to go to class while calling the samu when I just couldn't think right at that moment so I didn't know what to do I couldn't think of anything. I talked to her about it later and she apologized and I told her what's best if she wants to help is just to stay here with me and don't talk.

Yesterday was also pretty traumatic; I had a huge panic attack coming. I asked her if she could step out with me for a sec because I was feeling really bad and she got angry at me by saying me in a very rude tone : ""I know you don't like how I'm reacting but I just don't wanna miss my class. Me too I have panic attack everyday but like right now you're just bringing me down so now I'm gonna go back because I don't want to miss my chance to show my work because if you."" (It was just for a few minutes on a 3-hour class...) Given the fact that I didn't go to school for the past 2 weeks before that, I just felt like a fucking burden like she was just telling me she was better off with me. And that was so violent I mean that's my best friend I trusted her, I needed her and that hurt me and my self-esteem deeply. 

Especially since she never told me she was not going well and she knew she could have told me if she felt overwhelmed by what I'm going through and the fact that I talk to her about it... But she didn't tell me anything I just got her frustration in my face in a middle of an important panic attack.

And I just hate that situation I keep going back and forth to anger and guilt... I couldn't even go to class today...

Also I keep having weird interactions with people since I have anxiety I feel like I always do the wrong thing or what I do gets interpreted really badly and I just feel like a burden even to stranger.

All of that to say : everything got complicated since I have anxiety. My relationships, my way of living. And gosh therapy takes so long to fix things I want them fixed quickly...

I'm feeling desperate and depressed. When I feel better things brags me even deeper into a depressive state...",anxiety
"Not sure what changed  Hi guys i’m 17M, i’ve been diagnosed with anxiety for a few years now, along with depression, ocd, and autism (fun..) anyway I’ve had my share of anxiety as a kid, and during the pandemic but for the most part it was controlled in a sense i could feel it happening and most of the time was able to understand why i was anxious and how to cope.

I've had my blood pressure monitored and have had soooo many blood tests. I see my doctor regularly and apart from needing to lose some weight he has not been concerned about my current health status. Despite all this I still get anxious when I exercise and get my heart rate up, when I eat something that feels less than heart healthy, or when I have any kind of pain in my chest or back area.   
I am very observative about my health, most people would say too much so. As I said I have put myself through the emergency room like 3-4 times this year and have been to my doctor's office 3-4 times this year.

Heart palpitations, major dizziness, muscle tension, tmj pain, headaches, can't relax, can't catch my breath etc.

I can't get a drs appointment, not that they can do anything. I don't want to change my meds and I'm already seeing a therapist.

"My thoughts on the DARE program I just wanted to share my thoughts on the popular DARE program because I see nothing but glowing reviews online and I haven't had a very positive experience. This is only my experience and my opinion so it may work for other people. I read the book and used the app, and then I did DARE academy. I really didn't like how it made a lot of promises like ""you will see results in a short period of time if you do this simple thing"" and made claims like ""all you need is DARE"" (this was literally one of the daily DARE audios). But when I went through the DARE academy, there were a lot of people who didn't seem to be feeling better, myself included, but the response to it is always ""you're just not accepting your anxiety fully"" or ""you're just not fully committing yourself to DARE."" This gives me an icky faith healing vibe, not to mention when some people continued to express their frustration, they were told they just needed to get a therapist or get on medication. I didn't like this either because it was so contradictory to the promises that were made in the beginning and the claims that all you need to do is DARE. I just generally find the program to be scammy and culty, and didn't gain much from it except for the core concept that anxiety disorders get worse when you become fixated on fighting the anxiety. This is not something I had to spend hundreds of dollars to learn, and I felt more relief from watching Anxiety Guy videos on YouTube (his surrender session videos are similar in concept). I just felt like I spent a lot of money thinking I was going to get extra guidance and support, but all I really felt was criticism by the DARE coaches for not ""getting it."" I also felt the approach was very one size fits all and didn't recognize that anxiety stemming from trauma can look really different and need more somatic approaches than more cognitive, generalized anxiety. Anyway, telling myself that I accept my anxious feelings over and over again did not really help my anxiety. I don't want to discourage anyone from trying DARE or argue with anyone who found success with it, but I wanted to offer a different perspective from what I usually see on here about DARE.

So almost immediately i had to drop most of my hobbies (choir, sports, camping) and over time im losing friends and rejecting potentional romantic partners due to sheer inability to show up. So even tho my pain is mostly physical and i usually dont have anxious thoughts, i am inevitably spiralling into depression, not because i feel subjectively terrible, but my life is objectively terrible. Distancing myself from all friendly interactions works contraproductively, so the best i can do right now is forcing myself to attend at least something, even if i am in pain, otherwise i would socially degenerate.

Does anyone have some experience with anything similar?

Edit: when its bad i have trouble eating (meaning like 1 meal a day tops)",anxiety
"Middle life crisis? I don’t know if it’s anxiety, depression, or just my obsession with trying to keep everything under control, but lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about my own death. What terrifies me isn’t the idea of dying itself, but rather the thought of being alone in the end, without someone dear to handle my burial or cremation. I know it might sound strange, but these thoughts have been driving me crazy. I don’t have siblings, and most of my family members are older than me, while the few younger ones live abroad. I chose to be child-free, but recently I’ve found myself wondering if I should have a child just to ensure there’s someone there at the end (which, of course, I realize isn’t a good reason to have a child…). But why have these thoughts suddenly taken over my mind? I have real problems to deal with, and the last thing I need right now is to lose my sanity over this. Is this a midlife crisis? Has someone experience something similar in your 40s?",anxiety
"i get anxious when someone’s a little cold to me (25F) I’ve kinda fallen in love with someone lately and each time he’s a little bit cold to me(or is simply busy), i get anxious 🤡. It makes me feel so stupid that one person can even have that much impact on my mood, but i think there’s a good reason for it. I’m really lonely. Like, i don’t have many people in my life, no family anymore, no friends, only roommates And they don’t even like me and kinda bully me. So yeah, when the one person i like, who is so sweet to me, is a little less sweet, or gives me less attention than normal, i’m scared he‘s not into me anymore. I talked to my therapist about it too, he said: “Your world is so small, because you don’t have many people in it. If something like this would happen to someone with a bigger social life, it would impact them less, than it does for you.” Which makes sense, but it doesn’t help. I’m not good at making friends. I have social anxiety and feel like everyone hates me :). Would appreciate some help or words of wisdom, or even words of comfort. Thanks <3",anxiety
"Will I lose weight on fluoxetine? My doctor put me on 10 mg of fluoxetine for my anxiety and OCD.

"Please, quit vaping. I've been vaping for probably 7-8 years now. I've been having crazy issues. All sorts of anxiety, chest pain, extremely high resting hr, jumps when I drink, etc... for the last two years.

Been to cardiology, they said I was fine. Many ER, primary doc, I feel like I've done everything. 

I quit vaping yesterday. It's been a full 24 hours. My resting hr has gone from 80-100 to 55-65. It doesn't increase nearly as fast. I feel better than I've felt in years. I've always known the harmful causes of nicotine. I didn't realize how big of a difference it would make me feel. All within 24 hours. Maybe it's a placebo, maybe I became extremely sensitive to nicotine. Who knows. 

I'll never touch one again. The withdrawals are nothing compared to the peace I feel having my hr this low. I can't remember the last time I felt safe in my own body and not afraid of my heart. Please, if you vape, try quitting. I know it's difficult, but, it's so worth the time.

"I’m so exhausted of feeling horrifically anxious and nauseous every morning I’m just at the end of my rope here.  Every single morning I wake up and have to deal with 3-4 hours of pretty intense nausea/anxiety/hot flashes.  I’m a 39-year old guy who has been a methadone patient for about 9 years now, and I smoke pot every day and have been smoking pot every day since I was about 15, barring a few years I took off here and there.  I was on Klonopin for anxiety (3mg every day) for about 7 years as well, but it’s now been 4 years since I stopped taking it after a year or so of tapering.  This morning misery started at the time when I stopped taking Klonopin and I’ve been ascribing it to benzo withdrawal, but 4 years?  It’s not as bad or as constant as it was, but it’s more than bad enough still.

I mean, I get up and just feel AWFUL.  After 3 or 4 hours of exhausting pacing, often while pinching myself because focusing on a point of pain is the only way I can keep from vomiting.  Hot showers used to help a little, but not so much anymore.  I sometimes think it may have to do with altitude, because these symptoms also started when I moved from sea level to living at 9000 feet above sea level in Colorado.  But then I was back on the east coast this summer and I was still dealing with this bullshit, though it wasn’t so bad.  

I know I could get probably go back on a daily benzodiazepine regimen and it would probably go away, but that would be tantamount to admitting that I’m going to spend the rest of my life on benzodiazepines, and I really don’t want to do that.  The two drugs I currently use on a daily basis don’t affect my ability to function, but I can’t say the same about benzodiazepines.

"I feel anxiety because of my accent  I'm Spanish speaker and living in the States for some years, I have learned English enough to communicate and understand, but also A LOT of times they do not understand my accent at work (especially) until I have to repeat like twice or four times at least.

I got the point having some accent it's okay and some people might like it and enjoy it (that's fine) but when that barrier blocks the understanding spoken words is where everything it's a problem. I can read and write like this but when talking I feel so dumb with my awful accent and my voice normally soft start getting lower due the lack of confidence and shame (in public) that I don't understand sometimes and neither they could understand me and finish giving up and staying quiet or pretending I get the meaning (a lot of times I don't even have the slightest clue of what was said) it's also too stressful and makes me feel stupid.

"I'm think that there are cameras in my room. Im 14 and I'm convinced my parents have secret cameras in the house and it really makes me uncomfortable, in my own home.

Firstly, A while ago, while trying to connect my Bluetooth headphones to my phone , they kept connecting to something different.I then heard talking through them , and realised it was a conversation I had the day before. I told my mum about it and she listened to it , but seemed weirdly calm about it which is weird because shes always paranoid about that stuff.I started searching for a camera because I remember my dad had a camera which also recorded audio and would set it up whenever we went on holiday, but I didn't find anything. 

Now recently , I glanced at my dad's phone unintentionally while we were sitting in the living room together,  and he had the app that the recordings for the camera were stored in and I swear I saw an image of our living room. Then a couple of days later , We were sitting in the car  outside of my house , waiting for my sister , and he opened the app again and I am convinced that it was a recording of our living room. I understand if the camera was there for security,  but we were litreally outside the house and left 5 minutes ago , and my mum was home. 

I obviously checked the room again, and in the TV box or whatever it's called, when you shine a light on it there's something that looks like a camera and has that type of blue shine on it , like phone camera has. It also had hot glue or something around it so it looks like it's been stuck in. I'm not sure if this is just a Sensor or something for the TV remote ,but it looks like a camera.

"I need help I don't know if I'm ok ok. that's a first for me on reddit but this platform kinda helped me in the past but I don't see anyone with my situation so id like to make my own post.

I'm a 21yo woman, I recently graduated and got an apprenticeship in a tattoo studio. that's a lot of change considering I don't always know how to deal with change. in July I also moved in a new appartement so that's a big change too. it's a good appartement but I still dont know if I truly feel home here. that's the same for my job, it's quite stressful considering it's a day to day job, not knowing when you'll have clients or be able to tattoo and stuff. 

but here is the thing. everything is going good. like, that's stupid but the new appartement is bigger in a quieter city, I get to leave my stressful studies to do what I like with my life, and it's been a month and I'm already able to tattoo people so I guess I'm even good at what I'm doing.

still, I had health anxiety my whole life but it really flares when I'm stressed. it flared realllly bad the last few months, going worst and worst. I had nausea (I have emetophobia), I had vertigos and dizziness and that freaked me out so I became hypervigilant about that so I always felt weak and stuff. I also got hypervigilant with my vision because a few years ago I had several aura migraines that terrified me (because of the pain + my eyes going kinda blind for an hour and my body getting numb on one side). Im always scared that the worse is gonna happen and my biggest fear is losing control. control of my thoughts, my body etc. that's the reason I don't drink for example and the reason Why vertigos freak me out so so badly. so I had health anxiety for a few weeks, getting worse and worse. 

and here I am, a few days ago, I had a panic attack/anxiety attack that led to suicidal thoughts. like I get so desperate at that moment my brain only sees that option to cope. but, other than that, I sleep well, eat properly, and when Im not anxious so about 50-60% of my day, Im really really good. like I laugh, I smile and stuff like everything is fine.

but, sometimes during my day, I get randomly really anxious for about 30min to an hour or 2, it depends. during those moments, I truly really really feel like my life is a mess, like I'm convinced I need to commit. that doesn't make sense and I'm scared. during those moments I feel like all the good moments never existed and my life is falling apart, I feel like I'm losing my mind. and when it's over I feel ok I guess?

I truly don't understand what is happening to me and why I'm ok and the next second I'm panicking and feel like I'm seeing my life as a whole mess. I don't know if I try to sabotage myself because everything is quite good in my life and it never happened so my brain needs a problem to focus on? maybe it's my brain not adjusting to the changes in my life? because in those bad moments I also feel like I don't have a ""comfort zone"", like I'm ALWAYS on edge, about to lose it, and I don't have nowhere to rest and feel comfortable. and that's quite true I guess?

I live with my boyfriend of 3 years and were happy so that doesn't make sense that I feel so desperate. everything is good and the only thing that is making me crazy is that I always always always think of the next moment I'll be feeling suicidal again, the next problem in my life, the next bad thing that will happen.

and the funny thing is that it's been 3 days I obsess over those suicidal and very very desperate thoughts, and today for like the first time, I got so busy with these thoughts I didn't have vertigo at all, nor dizziness. that juste proves how that was all in my head. but my brain always needs a bad thing to hyper focus on. I don't want to kill myself, at least I don't think, because these thoughts scare me and I don't understand them at all.

also I have a psy appointment at the end of the month (in 20 days) and I just feel like I'm going mad. why can't my brain just accept that I'm doing ok with my life? I have severe mother trauma that interferes with this I think, thinking that I don't deserve to be happy or that I never do anything good enough so maybe there's that too. 

please help. am I going mad? I need to know if the moments I'm happy during my day and don't think about anything bad are genuine or if I'm just in denial of my life falling apart. I can't tell what version of me is legit. if it's the depressed one wanting to commit or if it's the happy one not thinking about it when busy.

"Kids should be taught about how anxiety/stress arises in the brain and how to overcome it. I keep reading about record numbers of anxiety/stress in kids and adults but I don't see many solutions that actually get the issue of how it anxiety/stress forms int he first place and how to overcome it. I have no idea why the current understanding of how anxiety/stress arises in the brain is not taught in school to kids so they can learn how to recognise it and be taught the tools to overcome it. Here is what I would do,

# Why Teaching About the Amygdala and Thoughts in Schools Would Be Transformative

1. **Reducing Anxiety and Fear Responses**: If kids understood that fear and anxiety often stem from the amygdala’s response to perceived threats (not actual threats), they’d be more equipped to handle anxiety-provoking situations. They’d know they have the power to retrain their brain through exposure and reframing, rather than avoiding situations and unintentionally reinforcing their fears.
2. **Developing Resilience**: Teaching kids how to confront their fears in a healthy way could help them build resilience. Instead of fearing failure or embarrassment, they could view these as normal parts of growth. They would learn that exposure and a bit of humor about the situation can help them overcome their fears, making life’s challenges more approachable.
3. **Normalizing Random, Unwanted Thoughts**: Explaining that most of our thoughts are just random, fleeting, and don’t define us would free kids from taking every thought seriously. They would realize that intrusive or strange thoughts don’t reflect who they are or what they truly want; they’re simply the brain’s “noise.” This could reduce self-judgment and help them develop a healthier relationship with their inner thoughts.
4. **Empowering Self-Regulation Skills**: By understanding how intentional thought differs from random thought, kids could start to discern what to focus on and what to let go. They’d learn to channel their attention towards intentional thoughts that serve them, while acknowledging and dismissing the random “junk” thoughts.
5. **Improving Mental Health Literacy**: Providing this knowledge would help demystify mental health. Kids would see that anxiety, stress, and intrusive thoughts are part of being human, not signs of weakness. It would also open up space for discussing emotions openly, helping to reduce the stigma around mental health from a young age.

# Practical Ways Schools Could Implement This Learning

1. **Basic Neuroscience in Health Education**: Simple lessons about the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and how thoughts work could give students insight into how their brains process emotions and reactions. Age-appropriate discussions on how thoughts aren’t always meaningful would help normalize experiences like intrusive thoughts.
2. **Mindfulness and Cognitive Skills Classes**: Mindfulness practices, along with teaching kids to identify and challenge negative thoughts, would give them direct experience in regulating emotions and letting go of unhelpful thoughts. They could learn that they don’t have to believe every thought or feel defined by every feeling.
3. **Emotional Resilience Programs**: Programs focused on emotional resilience and self-compassion would teach kids how to approach fears with curiosity and humor, to see challenges as opportunities for growth, and to view ""failure"" as just a step in learning.
4. **Journaling and Reflection**: Journaling could help students reflect on their thoughts and experiences without over-attaching to them. Writing out fears or intrusive thoughts could even allow them to see how absurd some thoughts are, reinforcing that not every thought holds value.
5. **Classroom Discussions on Growth Mindset**: Conversations around growth mindset, fear, and resilience could reinforce the idea that challenges, setbacks, and anxiety are part of growth, not indicators of their self-worth.

This basic level of teaching to kids and adults could help them to become more resilient to anxiety and stress and know how to deal with it if they do experience it. So why on earth is it not implemented in schools?",anxiety

I’ve been to a couple of parties with her recently and before, when I’m about to leave, I just get hit with waves of nausea and have actually thrown up a few times. And if there’s a social thing coming up (which there is for me this weekend), I get very anxious about it throughout the week which has a knock on effect on everything else I do (schoolwork, eating dinner, going to the gym, etc.). Can someone please share anything that helped them? I really want to enjoy these things as they should be fun most of the time, but I’m really struggling to get into it when previously I could party and things and be fine about it (before my anxiety started) Thanks!!!",anxiety

"I can’t relax at school because I keep thinking of something that happened (TW: Suicide) TW: Suicide

Awhile ago I was at school when something really bad happened. I got a text from my sibling saying they were going to off themselves. My sibling is okay now and getting medical support, they seem to be doing better but now every time I am in the building where I got the text I feel so on edge.

It was on a Tuesday when it happened, and I just feel a sense of doom every time I have to be in this building now. I know I probably shouldn’t avoid it but I do. I feel so dumb for this, but it’s made me want to not go to school.

Like last Tuesday I had another breakdown while at school, but it wasn’t because I was thinking about what happened with my sibling. I have OCD and I couldn’t stop ruminating over something totally unrelated. Is it possible the environment can make my OCD worse?

"Anxiety is going to ruin my life  Hi all, (27,F)

Over the past few months my anxiety has spiralled and I have missed lots of days off work due to this. My boss is aware of the situation with my father because I have told him. 

I also don’t get paid for my sick days, so I’m loosing lots of money putting pressure on my wife which is stressing her out as we have a mortgage and fur babies to feed.

So around a month ago my dad got diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer. He is doing fine and the doctors have said that everything will be fine in the end which is the best news. (Fingers crossed). 

I’m starting to think maybe it’s work causing me to feel anxious as I really only feel super anxious the night before or the morning of my work day. I have a doctors appointment booked but concerned about getting hooked onto tablets. 

Should I quit my job and see if things change? I need to change something before anxiety ruins my life. ",anxiety

"Was this a panic attack? So I'm almost positive I just had a panic attack (I've had a couple in the past also), but my health anxiety is saying it was definitely not, and that I'm gonna die. So for the past couple of days, I've had a persistent headache. It had been better this morning. It wasn't gone, but the pain was less intense than it had been. The headaches (and some other recent events in my life) have had me really stressed, making me think I have a brain tumor or something, which is already a huge fear of mine. Anyways, I was doing some really routine things this morning, and I bent over to pick something up, and my headache really flared and the pain spiked. My first thought was that that DEFINITELY meant I DO have a brain tumor. I straightened up, still thinking about brain tumor shit, and I starting shaking, getting really dizzy, my heart started racing, I was feeling lightheaded, getting chills while sweating, and my muscles got all weak and ""jelly"" like. I went inside (this happened outside) and layed down for a couple of minutes. I tried to take some deep breaths because my breathing was kinda fast, and I listened to something that helps distract and calm me down. I still couldn't stop shaking, and I got a lot of horrible intrusive/racing thoughts. I eventually started to feel better, but I was still a bit shaky and a little nauseous. Sorry if this is long, I just wanna have all the details laid out. Do you guys think this was a panic attack, or was it something physical like health anxiety is trying to say? It's so hard for me to even know what are real, physical symptoms, and what are just anxiety symptoms anymore. 


By the way, I typically am pretty dizzy, tend to sweat a lot, have intrusive and racing thoughts, some mild compulsive behavior, irritability, and just overall have typical anxiety symptoms. I'm diagnosed with GAD, and have been on Zoloft for years. I did therapy for 2.5 years and didn't really see results. I'm currently meditating 15-25 minutes a day, I'm active, I eat healthy, try to get 7.5-8 hours sleep most nights, and drink a ton of water.

"Seeking advice on overcoming health-related anxiety affecting my sleep

 About ten days ago, I used to sleep peacefully for a solid 7 hours. However, last Tuesday, I received some upsetting news about my health, and since then, anxiety has been keeping me up.

I keep waking up early in the morning (around 4-5 AM) with intense anxiety and negative thoughts flooding back.

I've been trying various natural techniques to combat anxiety, and while they help during the day, nights are still difficult. Has anyone else gone through something similar?

"I'm tired of feeling pain in my body and freaking out so badly over it.  Yes I'm seeing a pcp. Yes I voice my concerns and am receiving healthcare. No I am not seeking medical advice. Just, we'll, kinda wanna cry on reddit shoulder. 

My neck, shoulder, and back hurt ALL the time. The kind of hurt that you just wish you could make go away with a simple Crack or pop of your back ya know? It's only gotten worse as the weeks go on. And the pain has spread. No amount of ibuprofen or aspirin makes it actually go away. It's always here and always hurts. 

I think it's a pinched nerve.
Yes I let my doc know. Yes I plan to monitor and report. Yes I will request a ct scan. Yes I've had blood tests that show I'm fine. 

I'm just tired of feeling this and assuming the worst. ""it's cancer and it's spreading"". or ""it's a heart attack"". or ""you're developing a kidney infection. you're gonna die"". 

Yes I got blood tests. Yes I'm receiving care. I just want to get my brain to realize I'm genuinely probably not actually sick with a deadly rare illness. I'm so exhausted of how scared I am of... probably nothing. 

God. I'm thankful for tik tok but it has SEVERELY increased my medical fear. I'm constantly seeing ""at first it was (insert mild symptom), turns out it was (very rare or uncommon disease/illness). And then you see hundreds and hundreds of comments of ""that was me too!"" and I'm just like... is it that common? Could I very well be becoming ill and just not know it? 


Why am I like this!?! Is it because I had a random kidney infection years ago? I thought it was just a tummy ache, so I ignored it until I developed a fever and severe pain. I guess it just feels like I'm about to experience sudden onset pain, discomfort, and illness. Now when I experience severe pain, I become pretty scared. 


Anyone else deal with this? What helps to cope? I promise I'm not reassurance seeking. I just want to know what techniques others have used that really help break this fear down. I'll ask my therapist also, but we only meet up every 2 weeks and he never answers my emails :(.

"Any of ya all feel HORNY while being depressed with OCD but regret it later  I’m hoping to find some understanding and perhaps some advice. I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for a while, and I’ve noticed a strange pattern: during my low moments, I often feel an intense surge of sexual energy. It’s really confusing because, at the same time, I feel so down and hopeless. Recently, I watched some porn, and while it gave me a temporary distraction, it ultimately left me feeling even more depressed and horrible afterward.

To complicate matters further, I also struggle with OCD, which makes it really hard for me to engage in masturbation or even enjoy any kind of sexual release. I feel like my sexual life is getting suppressed, yet there’s this constant, conflicting push and pull between feeling horny and feeling utterly depressed. It’s frustrating and isolating.

Has anyone experienced something similar? How do you navigate these feelings and this complicated relationship with sexuality when dealing with mental health issues? Any tips or shared experiences would be really appreciated.

"Things I'm learning from anxiety - can anyone else relate?

I've spent a lot of my life with anxiety growing untreated in the background. I think because I didn't know I had anxiety, any anxious/intrusive thought was met with real gut-wrenching fear and I immediately pushed it away (but the fear and thought would come back or basically remain...).

The thing about it all was, that I thought these hazy but scary thoughts or fears MEANT something. So I attributed a strange importance to them ""There's something wrong with that place I'd better avoid it"" but learning recently that that might not actually be true, is a bit of a relief....it might just be that my brain is slightly mixed up regarding how it processes anxiety and has mislead me my whole life.

"Update 11/5/24 I am realizing that going to the psychologist is no longer worth anything, he only repeats to me what I already know, and yes, I feel good in the session because he manages to question my fatalistic thoughts.

But even so, when I return to everyday life it is clear that I have a very sensitive nervous system because at the slightest symptom I am not able to not feel rejection and fear that the symptoms will get worse, especially with the PVCs, I have not felt any for a few days, but as soon as I feel something stomach-related or related to the stomach, diaphragm, lungs, ribs area, unconsciously my fear levels increase causing poor breathing and tension that aggravates the symptoms, whatever I do during the day I try to do it from total calm, but even so I have a certain degree of body self-monitoring and some avoidance (because I know that if I don't realize it, I could be breathing wrong)

I know that you can be completely free of this and the symptoms disappear and I gain a strength and confidence that even surprises me, but that is the problem ""I know"" but another thing is to feel it because this is ultimately an emotional problem not rational.

Distraction is a key ally, but you can subconsciously link certain daily tasks to this whole picture of worry. I think that is the most difficult thing: ""disconnecting anxious thoughts from tasks that have been tainted by a crisis or an anxious habit.""

As some videos suggest, the dog that is scared while playing the sound links the sound to the scare, then when you play the sound alone the dog gets scared, but the more you play the sound without scaring it, the dog loses sensitivity to the stimulus.

"Illness Anxiety I've been dealing with what I think is illness anxiety for about two years now. Last year, I was away from home for my job. One night after my shift (working from home), I went to sleep around 3 a.m. I had been drinking quite a bit over the previous two days, but I didn’t think that was an issue. However, after just 15 minutes of sleep, I woke up with a racing heart and a locked jaw, thinking I was having a heart attack. I rushed to the ER, convinced I was about to die during that 10-minute ride. By morning, they discharged me, and I felt fine, but then it happened again that evening, and it kept happening for the next three or four days. I decided to return home, as I was already working remotely.

Even during the train journey back, I had another episode, and I had to get off to visit the ER. But just like before, as soon as I arrived, everything felt normal again. Once home, I saw my GP, who prescribed me Klonopin (0.5 mg), propranolol (20 mg), and some multivitamins. The episodes stopped, and I eventually realized I was experiencing panic attacks after learning more about Klonopin’s purpose. However, my doctor never mentioned when to stop taking Klonopin and advised I continue it for at least a year—which I now see was a mistake.

Throughout that year, I experienced other symptoms like crying for no apparent reason, a racing heartbeat, and an inability to exercise because of it. After a year, I stopped all the medications cold turkey, without realizing that withdrawal symptoms could be severe. That’s when I truly experienced the consequences of stopping Klonopin after a year of use.

I had to see a psychiatrist (it’s quite taboo here, so I didn’t tell anyone and consulted one online). They prescribed me Paroxetine, which was honestly terrible, so I stopped. I saw another doctor who prescribed Lexapro (5 mg). After a week, I felt like myself again. All the horrors—depersonalization, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), suicidal thoughts, and impulsive thoughts—faded. After a year, my doctor increased the dose to 20 mg, and I felt better than ever.

But still, the fear of illness hasn’t gone away. I’m anxious about going places alone because of thoughts like, what if I feel the urge to jump off the train or do something impulsive. Recently, I learned about illness anxiety and OCD, and I think I might have OCD centered around suicidal thoughts.

How do I move past this illness anxiety?",anxiety
"My experience with health anxiety, and why I can promise that you are almost certainly okay. !Trigger warning: discussion of health anxiety, medical tests, detailed description of symptoms, and mentions of specific illnesses!

Tl;dr at the bottom for those short on time/patience.

Hello everyone,

Unfortunately, if you are reading this, you are probably familiar with the cost that stress and anxiety can exact on your body- you might even be experiencing the effects right now. This post is not the first of its kind, and it certainly won't be the last, but I'm hoping that my words can soothe someone out there.

I F18, began experiencing a swath of disturbing neurological symptoms around 3 years ago. I still remember the day when I first felt ""off."" I had been through a particularly stressful day, when all of the sudden, I had the mental feeling of being struck by lightning, and the next minute my hands and calves were very finely shaking. It was worrying, but I ignored it and figured that I would wake up tomorrow and it would be gone.

Predictably, I woke up the next day, and it was not gone- nope, it had instead spread to seemingly every limb in my body except for my head. Over the next months and years, I would slowly gain a new symptom, and lose another. This would continue in cycles that I (blindly) couldn't associate with the (now obvious) rises in stress I experienced at times. Looking back, I'm surprised that I was able to keep my shit together while feeling like I was literally falling apart at the seams, but amazingly, I didn't visit a doctor about my symptoms until just this April when I ended up in the ER. 

The event that sent me there was a terrifying one. I had woken up around 3am to stabbing pain and glanced down to see my right hand uncontrollably and painfully curling itself into my arm. I tried to pry open my fingers and straighten my wrist, but all I could feel was the resistance of the muscles in my palm and tendons. Of course, that sent me into a full-blown panic attack. My only thought was ""Oh god, I waited too long, and now I've just lost use of my arm forever."" After about 40 minutes, my hand relaxed into a slightly more normal position and I managed to fall back asleep, but the first thing I did the next morning was take myself to the hospital because I was still fully convinced I was dying...or at least in the process of losing control of my limbs. The ER doctors were surprisingly accommodating. I think the sheer timespan of my symptoms caused them to take me seriously. By the end of the day, I had gotten an ekg, extensive labs, an ultrasound of my adrenal glands and thyroid, a basic neurological workover, an IV, and most importantly: a CT scan of my brain- which, shockingly, showed absolutely no abnormalities. I left the hospital slightly relieved and with a referral to a proper neurologist, but I still felt my anxiety screaming at me that they had simply missed the real and probably chronic cause of all of my problems.

A month later I made it to my neurology appointment, and told the doctor everything. At that time, my daily symptoms consisted of, but were not limited to: whole body tremors during \*any\* movement, aphantasia (phantom pressure, tingles, etc) in my chest and back, loss of balance, altered gait, perceived weakness in my right arm, flashes of color and sensitivity to light in both of my eyes, hours-long episodes of shortness of breath, restless legs, hypnic jerks, and severe & painful cramping attacks. My visit ended in an order for a contrast MRI of my brain and spine. I was 100% sure at this point that I had MS and that one of the MRIs would reveal the lesion that had been eating away at my body, proving that my anxiety had been right all along. I anxiously waited through the weekend for my results, and when they came I was blown away, I had......

...nothing. In fact, in a follow-up exam, my neurologist scrolled through the model of my brain just to point out how standard it was.

Fast forward to the present, and practically all of my symptoms are gone. I still experience a slight tremble in my fingers every now and then, and if I'm going through a heavy period of stress, I notice that some of my symptoms reappear. But, therapy has revealed to me that my anxiety and extensive traumas affect me in more ways than I realize. And that, through no fault of my own, my brain had decided to express overwhelming emotions in a physical manner. The most I can do is show up for annual doctor's visits, eat a healthy diet, exercise, and take medication if I need to. 

I just wanted to share my story with you guys' because this sub is one of the many that I scrolled through for hours when I was at my worst. I know how haunting anxiety can be, and how hopeless physical symptoms can make daily life feel. If you are going through something similar to what I described, I encourage you discuss it with a doctor, so that you can have a concrete answer. If, for some reason, you can't do that or already have to no avail, just know that YES, anxiety, stress, & trauma can cause absolutely insane symptoms. You can 100% make it through this, guys.

Wishing everyone here peace and strength,

DM me or drop me a comment if you have any questions or need a little more comfort.

Tl;dr: Had a sudden onset of constant, horrendous, unexplained neurological symptoms. They got worse for years, until I got a ton of tests which showed that I was, in fact, physically fine. Anxiety, stress, trauma, mental health in general can cause \*real\* symptoms in an otherwise perfectly healthy person. Love yourself, and know that your symptoms are 99.9999999% likely not a sign of some rare or fatal disease.

"Panic attack meltdown relief help I have been extremely stressed, depressed, and having panic attacks for the last six months. I am not going to go into details but it’s to the point where the smallest disruptions cause me into a meltdown. I have hit my breaking point and went to see a doctor today after waiting a couple weeks. They prescribed me two medications, Abilify and Cymbalta. Abilify is $500+ without insurance at my pharmacy. I am currently unemployed due to my mental health. I now have to wait for them to transfer it to a different pharmacy where I can use goodRX so it is affordable. 

So of course when I got back to my car I had a full blown melt down. You know how hard it is getting ahold of your doctor and I am feeling hopeless this is going to be resolved soon. I just so desperately need relief.

I need something to help me in this moment. I’m just coming down after that meltdown. Is there something over the counter or something I can do to help calm me during this time. I am on the verge of 5150’ing myself, but I cannot afford that right now and the stress of being in medical debt (which I already am) will put me into another tailspin. ",anxiety

"Anxiety disorder and medical procedures Hello everybody that is taking the time to read this ***(sorry if it's very poorly written)***, I'm currently going through a ridiculously long process with my GP and gastrointestinal doctor, they have pretty much reached the conclusion that i most likely have some form of IBS and IBD after doing two stool lab tests, the whole thing is that they tried forcing me into a coloscopy in just a two week period and I told them that it was way too short of a notice to get something like that done, they know about my anxiety and hypochondria and understood that i sometimes just need a bit of time to fully prepare myself for this, It's now been over 2 months of constant visits to the gp ***(That he forced me to do)*** and just talking about my symptoms and how i felt, I told them that i was finally comfortable with going through with the coloscopy but only wanted to request that i could do it fully awake without an IV ***(Just knowing that there is a needle near me can give me a panic attack)*** and only because of this request they've decided to delay it even more and now I'm just lost, they're making it a hell for me, refusing to give alternative options and now i'm just stuck here with pain and uncertainty of what it could be. and i understand that it's partially my fault because the anxiety got so bad that I've convinced myself that it could've been cancer ***(and that was highly unlikely as they told me that)*** that i just couldn't do it, but aren't doctors supposed to make the procedure as comfortable for the patient as possible? I've had friends who also suffer from IBD who had the coloscopy without an IV and now they are refusing to do it for me.... like what the hell... I'm just here daily thinking it's the worst of the worst fearing not waking up in the morning I just don't know what to really do, I've tried calling the GP but I'm not getting any help as he's on some vacation right now and they are refusing to let me talk to a different GP.....",anxiety

"Went to a job interview against my ""anxieties"" and still passed Exams, interviews - they scare me to death. I am a perfectionist, I could be hard on myself and unforgiving at times. I got called for an interview for a job I knew I had 50-50 chances. I don't like 50-50 uncertainty and this was giving fear of failing, social embarrassment, to the point I couldn't sleep the night before and had to cancel the following day because I woke up with tingling sensations in my hands. I told myself, if this company let's me reschedule, I will give it another chance and they did. 

On the day of interview, I had to literally drag myself to the face-to-face interview constantly telling myself, this is not a death sentence, I am not going to die if I fail. 

Result: the technical exam did not turn out to be as difficult as I expected it to be. I passed with 80% score. I was able to build a nice rapport with the hiring manager during the interview. I was offered the job.

\--

I know that this is not the end of the struggle. It's going to be a daily challenge of embracing uncertainty in this job where I have a lot to learn on-the-job, but I am deciding to face it one day at a time. So to all those who are dealing with a similar situation, I hope this can inspire you to do the same.   ",anxiety
"I feel like anxiety has completely shrunk my emotional range  On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the happiest you can be, and 1 being the saddest/angriest you can be, my emotional range is 4-5 99%of the time. 

I feel like over my life I have hid emotions and now I barely have emotions to show. I don't get overly sad or angry which I guess is a win, but I don't get excited or happy over things hardly at all either. 

Whats worse is I will look forward to something planned, say a concert, but when the event comes I feel so anxious I can't ever enjoy it.

"Anxiety causing low libido but fear of SSRI causing ED or further loss of libido. Catch 22 Bit of a catch 22 situation here i feel. I am a 45 year old male who's suffered with anxiety for most of my life. A lot seems to be around my health. Racing thoughts which then lead me to bouts of depression. Not wanting to wake up on a morning with that feeling of doom. I now seem to have had a big dip in my sex drive and im currently in a bout of anxiety / depression so i'm assuming this is the cause. I have had me hormones tested and all are fine so its not physiological. 

I was on sertraline for a while but i found that sometimes it took me a while to climax. However, i'm sure i didn't have any libido issues or ED when on this med. I did feel a lot better when on sertraline and the increase in time to climax isn't always a negative. However, i did change to Mirtazapine as i started a new relationship and i was worried that the length of time it was taking me to climax may have made my new partner concerned. I then decided to take a medication break which was around 6 months ago. 

In those 6 months i have had a few life situations and i feel my anxiety / depression as slowly started to return and then out of no where my sex drive as dropped. I still think about sex just haven't got the same horniness like i did have last year. 

I do feel like its my anxiety that's causing the libido dip but then i'm afraid going back on SSRI may cause a bigger dip or even ED. ",anxiety

I took two at around 5pm last night, lo and behold I could breathe again! Went to bed fairly early, looking forward to a nice comfy sleep…

Woke up at around 2am with what I can only describe as sheer terror. I’m panicking lying down, I’m panicking walking around, I am an absolute wreck. I’ve been throwing up most of the night (a lovely way my anxiety likes to rear its head) and have been scaring myself shitless reading stuff about it being a no-no for people with high blood pressure and anxiety. I take a low dose of propanolol for anxiety which usually curbs the physical symptoms, but of course I’ve been googling possible drug interactions and giving myself the fear. 

It is now 8:30am and I am a mess. I haven’t slept at all, the jitters/exhaustion is unreal and I’m not sure how long this will last. I’ve called in sick as I just cannot fathom getting through the day feeling like this. Has anyone ever experienced this? ",anxiety

"Beta blockers for anxiety or SSRIs Hey folks, I have pretty severe anxiety and dpdr + probably depression on top. Currently I’m taking only Lamotrigine as mood stabiliser.

Always calculating and replying interactions I’ve had with people, trying to be perfect and never needing anything at all times to keep away from other’s judgement and just feel loved and have friends again, but as the years have gone by, I’ve grown more scared of slipping up because my tactics were not working (now that I think about it they never did), people still didn’t like me and I didn’t know why. I became isolated jumped from friend groups to friend groups following them like a puppy and still made no progress. I gave up and spent the rest of highschool alone which made me an awkward person. Talking to people made me feel unsafe in an environment I didn’t feel safe either (I was also very depressed). My heart would start racing and I would sometimes shake when I had to partner up with someone or had oral presentations (I would cry the night before and not be able to sleep). I would skip school everytime I felt overwhelmed and it carried on to college.

"I can’t live like this anymore. Hi! I hope whoever reads this is doing well and thank you in advance to clicking on my post. 

I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember. I noticed it in high school, but I’m positive it has been there my whole life. I was always a “jumpy” or paranoid kid, according to my family. In reality, I’m sure I was just anxious. Anyway, my anxiety has now gotten to a point where I’m not sure if I can spend the rest of my life dealing with it.

My anxiety manifests itself as a “highlight reel” in my head playing every mistake, embarrassing moment, and regret over and over. I can’t stop it from happening, no matter how many times I tell myself to be present in the moment. It’s especially bad days after something embarrassing happens. I can recognize that no one finds these moments important, but that doesn’t stop me from feeling incredibly bad about myself. Additionally, I am in a bad financial state as I lost my job last December and recently ran out of my savings. I have CC debt and a student loan I can’t pay, so I randomly get reminded of my financial ruin alongside my other mistakes. It’s all becoming too much. I broke down and cried for hours because I can’t turn the thoughts nor the physical response to them off (headache, insomnia, heart palpitations, upset stomach). I stopped talking about it with my family and friends because as well intentioned as they are, they can’t save me from my own mind. And I don’t want to worry them.

I tried meds. I was on Celexa for 10 years and it helped my depression tremendously, to the point it’s not really a problem. BUT my anxiety? Nothing helps except for Valium and I took those bc my Mom gave me hers (I stopped because I was beginning to abuse them).

I thought I’d been getting better socially but I’m having a really hard time with criticism. I’m still learning but making small mistakes and forgetting things is causing anxiety. I’m finding that I physically can’t speak both at work and in social interactions outside of work, and it’s getting worse. I’m having extra jobs thrown at me despite having adjustments related to my mental health where I’ve stated I need predictably and routine and getting tasked changed on the spot is causing my anxiety to sky rocket. 

Second is related to pay. I haven’t been paid in the (just over) 2 months I’ve worked there. First month, I didn’t get told I needed to do timesheets so I missed my first pay. I was due the pay for everything I’ve worked so far on the 31st October and found I haven’t been paid again. Apparently it was an issue with my bank account and I changed it straight away but I still haven’t been paid 6 days later. I can’t buy food, pay for nursery or baby formula and we’re going to run out today. Unpaid bills are piling up. 

The anxiety from all this is starting to cause physical problems. I’m sleeping 3 hours a night, waking up worrying. My hearts racing on and off. I’m having panic attacks again for the first time in months. My partners now having to take time off from work because it’s affecting my ability to look after our baby. I wish I’d never tried to work again (I’d spent a while unemployed because every time I try to work, my mental health declines but it’s probably the worst work anxiety I’ve ever had).

- most of my family is travelling until the end of the month in another country, leaving me home to take care of everything. i work from home, so it should be easy, but i can't help but feel overwhelmed 
- in february, i suffered from something called bppv (when your ear crystals decide to give you vertigo), and i dealt residual dizziness up until early summer when i finished seeing a vestibular therapist to deal with my slight balance issues. i basically had random moments every day where it felt like i was on a boat, but seeing the vestibular therapist helped a ton
- with all of that, im petrified that it'll come back this month while everyone is away - studies say there's a chance of it reoccurring within the same year), and i wont have any help or support around me to keep up with managing the house or taking care of my pet
- i feel slight dizziness when im more tired, and with trying to balance everything, ive been getting tired earlier, and i think that's what's also causing my anxiety spike today
- maybe also because i took my first supplement of magnesium today after dinner and im overthinking it
- maybe im also overthinking the fact that i made rice in the ricecooker for lunch today and left it closed in there for around 7-8 hours until i had some again for dinner (i unplugged it after lunch) and im scared i gave myself food poisoning lol - i nuked it in the microwave twice, because where i am now is pretty cold
- my anxiety's overall been pretty manageable this year, but as i've been laying in bed trying to go to sleep early and calm down, i think my brain is tricking me into thinking im dizzy when im not, and its making me think the worst (something will happen when nobody's here)

- weighted blanket! This helps me get such a better night’s sleep and comforts me during the day. 

- hot water bottle on my tummy. This just really comforts me and helps relax my stomach that gets quite tense when I’m anxious / feeling poorly. 

- ASMR. Some people hate it but I find it SO relaxing. I particularly love watching “ASMR massage” or “ASMR facial”. It sends me straight to sleep. 

- Disordered podcast by Drew Linsalata and Joshua Fletcher. The make me feel so seen. 

- Paint by numbers. Super relaxing and really lets my mind shut off. 

- Progressive Muscle Relaxation. This has really helped with muscle aches and learning how to unclench tight muscles. 

- Reading. I’m a huge reader and full time book editor so my favourite thing ever is falling into a fictional world. 

- practicing compassion. To do this I close my eyes and imagine myself feeling the way I feel (anxious) and then imagine non anxious me entering the scene and looking after her. It usually ends up being child me (anxious) being looked after by adult me. Very healing. 

- Cold flannel on the back of my neck and head. Really helps calm my nervous system. 

Hope these help! And feel free to share your own strategies in the comments. I’m always open for more :) ",anxiety

"Vitamin B induced anxiety/ panic attack/late reaction. Had 2 crazy experiences with high doses of vitamin B complex and doctors keep saying it’s just anxiety.
To start up I never had any history of panic attack/mental illnesses and generally have an unconcerned personality.

First weird episode: my blood pressure is elevated (160/100) after using vitamin b (250mg B1 /250mg B6 /1mgb12 cyanocobalamin) also weird feeling, heart palpitations and cannot sleep properly. I felt like I couldn’t breathe in metro and elevator. As my blood pressure was making me feel bad I went to emergency and they said this is a basic panic attack, I was like okay so?, we will give you serum and you will be fine. They administered IV Avil and within 10minutes, my blood pressure spiked up to 230/140, my face is also a bit paralyzed temporarily because of the pressure (i was scared as hell)They barely lower it back with 3 sublingual blood pressure pills to 160/100again.. after this episode i couldnt sleep for next 5 days. Not even 10 minutes. and kept having sudden blood pressure spike again up to 230/140. Meantime I was still taking that b vitamin tablets. Even the blood pressure medications were not working to lower it and doctors suspected adrenal tumor. To do further tests they said cut your vitamin b supplement. And guess what.. my symptoms subsided.. of course nothing positive come from the tests either. Blood pressure back normal to 135/85 too..

Second weird episode: after 3 months of the first episode, i was still having b12 deficiency and slight anemia. Doctors said having a shot of vitamin b complex would be easier and more tolerable.  Norogrizovim I.M. (100mg B1 /100mg B6 /1mg b12 hydroxocobolamin) is administered. After 5 minutes of the shot, my whole body had a burning sensation, like burning coals and pins were touching internally to my body, my eyes my head my hands all over of my body was aching burning and pain with blood pressure spiked to 230/130 again. They said you are fine,this is a panic attack go home and rest. I went outside walked around 1-2 hours and repeating myself this is anxiety and will be over soon.. however my symptoms become worse.. I was barely breathing and become pale and freeze cold. I went to emergency again and they said you are having a late reaction to the shot and administered a shot of Avil/Decort. My symptoms gone away in seconds..also blood pressure lowered to its usual value. Emergency doctor also told me to be careful with vitamin B complexes when I use it next time.

Now I am still deficient of b12 and folic acid and planning a pregnancy. And I have to try supplements again. Doctors keep insisting using the high doses again… have you ever experienced such side effect? Maybe I should try low dose supplements? I suspect that my body cannot tolerate the synthetic and high dose forms of vitamin b as I never had such issue before when i was using basic multi vitamin complexes. However,doctors keeps saying high dose of vitamin b will not cause any side effects or any negative effects at all and these all related to mental health (which were fairly peaceful before those 2 reactions..)

"In case it is anxiety … which I really don’t want that to be the answer but be honest IG the following are issues I had as a kid and I'll also list what I have experienced as I grew up... are these all anxiety? All my blood is coming back normal and I'm annoyed. 

Reflux 
Sensitivity to foods (gluten, dairy) and skincare product, earrings... allergic reactions 
Paradoxical reactions to psychiatric medication (if it's supposed to calm you down it seems to rile me up) 
Staph infections (pick scabs) 
Multiple breaks to left and right ankles 
Osteomyelitis (bone infection) (what caused this and could it be caused by scab picking)
mosquito bite swelling that is extreme (golf ball or tennis ball swelling) 
tingling in hands or feet. 
Cold feet 
raynauds 
Poor coordination in sports 

adulthood: 
Led and fluorescent lights- forget these. Why are these in every room. Please turn them off. 
Frequent throat infections pre tonsillectomy. 
Sinus infections once every couple months. 
Hate scents. 
Overwhelmed by running 🏃🏼‍♀️ and feeling very lightheaded when running on the treadmill 
Vertigo (debilitating vertigo from active things like sports where one moves up and down like rock climbing). 
🧗‍♀️ 
Costochondritis 
Arm and leg pain 

I'm going to forward this list to my entire team to try to figure out what this is 

Are these anxiety

"Question about SSRI Question about SSRI

Hi guys, I need your help with something since maybe one of you has more experience than me in this. I have been taking SSRI for a month because of my OCD and this is helping me a lot and I am feeling like I was before. I am a young man. The only thing is that when having sex I don't feel as much, the sensations are not the same and it takes me a long time to be able to have an orgasm. Well, I have this fear, it's a little irrational. Sometimes I feel like I don't feel anything like numb, does the other person feel that way? I mean, can I transmit these emotions to the other person? Or does the other person feel normal?


Since it takes me a long time to have an orgasm, I think I can satisfy the woman more?",anxiety
"Someone tell me imma be ok Yesterday I heard a noise in my head when I was waking up scared the absolute Shi- out of me. later that night my right half of body went weak and I ran to er. Did a CT and said no sign of bleeding or any aneurysms etc. well today the right half of my body is still weak and I’m dizzy and I’m terrified. Like what if it wouldn’t show last night but it’s getting worse or idk. Awful health anxiety here but it’s also been over 24 hours…. I feel like if it were to happen I’d be passing out, awful headache, slurred speech etc which I’m not. I think it’s just my anxiety ",anxiety
"How does everyone's anxiety manifest.? So. I've had no anxiety for the last I'd say 4 or 5 months. I mean it's been nice. I have no clue why I've done zero work and not changed my meds at all. I think my anxiety has a lot to do with my hormone fluctuations as I have PMDD. And I've been going through some changes so I chalked it up to that. Anyway today randomly I just started feeling like something was wrong. Those alarm bells. Dizziness too. I'd go sit down and calm down, and then I'd just flare up again. Probably for a good hour just off and on. It sucks because I felt like I was making some progress and now I'm just stuck in that ""what if I have it again tomorrow"" ""What if it gets worse"" ""What if what if what if""

Overthinking and anxiety  I’m F 20 and I have been through a lot in the past 2 and half almost three years both of my grandparents passed within a year of each other and I had to grow up quickly tbh. But I’m also a college student and I over think with assignments like and I doing this right or   Will I do okay on this test and I get frustrated and I get upset and cry because it get myself overwhelmed.

"I genuinely don't think I am capable of this. I'm serious. I know you hear it a lot and then later you hear how shit turned around for them and they found a job that suits them or a supportive partner or whatever else that has made life liveable. I thought I did everything right, from the very beginning, because I KNEW from a young child that I wouldn't be able to handle it. I got a degree (which is useless so doesn't even matter) I worked throughout college, but all my life has ever been and will ever be is this fucking pit in my stomach, anxiety filled nightmare. It doesn't matter what age I am or what stage of life I'm in. In kindergarten I destroyed myself worrying about the next day every night. Now, at 25, I worry about going to work every. Fucking. Day. No matter what. It literally does not matter. I live with this fucking feeling every second of every day. I've been to more therapists than I can count, been on as many medications as I was allowed to be, and it's done nothing, absolutely nothing. Even if I COULD live life that way, WHY would I???? Doing this for the rest of my life??? That sounds like actual Hell. For the rest of my life, I will just worry about being fired/homeless/hated at my job, etc especially because all my past jobs have all been everyone hating me and I have no idea why or how to fix it and everyone says that doesn't matter but I'd say it does since it makes the difference between a roof over your head or not. I'm seriously asking, what is the fucking point?",anxiety
"Every physical symptom under the sun is getting to me. I’m so tired.  I haven’t gotten out of bed today. I can’t help but think it’s not anxiety because literally everything is wrong and something new starts every single day. My stomach hurts, my not-stomach abdomen hurts, I’m nauseous, there’s a nauseous lump in my throat, my chest hurts all over the place, I get periods of feeling like I can’t breathe, im exhausted, my heart rate is through the roof, ive had random bouts of numbness on one side of my body, hot flashes, cold flashes, light sensitivity, today I had my elementary school classic sign of having to pee every 30 minutes, I can’t sleep, im never hungry but when I eat I get nauseous, I see spots, my vision is getting worse, im so dizzy. so dizzy. all the time. sitting down, standing up, walking around, drinking water, drinking Gatorade, nothing helps. There has to be something in my head or my heart or my lungs and I can’t stop looking shit up even though I know it’s making things worse because I spiral more otherwise in the moment. my heart has been cleared by a cardiologist and I’ve had a stomach ultrasound and I’ve had about a dozen blood tests taken and everything is normal. half a dozen doctors and urgent care visits, two days at the ER. im downing zofran and ginger candy like my life depends on it and I’ve gone through like ten packs of gum or something and those are the only things that have helped even a little bit. The other medicines I’ve tried have made me nauseous just like everything else. The constant gum chewing is starting to make my jaw hurt and cause additional headaches but I can’t stop doing it because it’s the only thing that keeps the throat nausea down.

i was diagnosed with anxiety in elementary school and have been taking medicine for it my whole life but it’s never failed on me like this. I’ve never felt like this. I might have to withdraw from my classes for the rest of the semester because I’ve been MIA for a month and we have a really strict attendance policy and my professors’ kindness can only stretch so far before they can’t do any more for me. im trying to keep up from home but it’s just not the same, I know I’m supposed to be failing every one of my classes and I swear I’m just kidding myself trying to pretend I can save my grade like this. But I don’t want to drop everything. I want to go back to my activities and groups because I’m leaving them to deal with my absence and asking for just one more week because it’ll definitely get better, it’ll surely get better. but it doesn’t. i just learned after writing like two more paragraphs that I missed my class registration day today. fuck.

for the irl physical activity I’m out of shape, and last time I practiced with them I started seeing spots and couldn’t keep up out of nowhere even though I’ve been part of this group for 3 years. I don’t want to have to leave this group. We have a deadline for what we’re working on and I’m barely still there because of multiple freak outs I had on them over the years. But the longer I beg for more time the more guilty I feel. I think that’s when this all started, at the end of the summer when all the sudden I was dizzy and nauseous all the time and couldnt walk anywhere without my heart rate spiking and couldn’t dance with them but everything is fine apparently. it’s just gotten worse but everything always comes back normal. I have an expensive ass ticket to go to a concert in a week and a half to see a Japanese artist that I don’t even know why they’re in such a small venue by me but if I miss that on top of everything else because I can’t even stand up for more than two minutes my whole world will be crushed man idk. 

the other two things are gaming because that’s all I love to do and feel like doing most of the time but lately I haven’t been able to play anything for more than an hour or so because I get nauseous or my head starts to hurt and I know I’m just fucking washed now in my competitive game I feel like my team won’t need me anymore or I’m rude for trying to pop back up at the end of our season when I’ve been missing for weeks and weeks and not playing or practicing because I don’t feel like it and I just can’t. Im scared I’m going to show up to my mmo raid  group tomorrow and not be able to make it through 3 hours with people Ive gotten to know, doing something I know how to do, because I’ve already called it quits early twice because “my tummy hurts” and god I feel like hot garbage every time I do it. Or maybe I just won’t be able to show up at all.

I’m scared to take a shower because it makes me dizzy and nauseous. I’m scared to eat because it makes me nauseous. All I want to do is sleep but I’m scared to sleep, because I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night every night for the past like two weeks straight into a panic attack. I took a full dose of sleep aid and I still woke up through it in the middle of the night. i had a dream last night where I started to vomit and that’s literally the thing im scared of most in the world. I’m scared to sleep because I don’t wanna wake up but not like in a sh kind of way. 

I don’t know what symptoms are from anxiety and what’s from sleep deprivation or what’s from something else and I can’t even ask anyone because it’s been so impossible to get an appointment with anyone. I saw a new psychiatrist and she’s really nice but the medicine changes aren’t drastic or fast enough and the place im supposed to start setting up therapy with is just completely MIA it’s starting to feel hopeless. 

I just feel bad for being so whiny and frustrating and making the same complaints in circles around and around and around, I can tell it’s driving my mom insane and I feel bad because she’s got so much on her plate right now and it makes my dad lose sleep when I wake up having a panic attack I can’t calm down from. I fear I’m driving one of my closest online friends away atm because he’s basically been my therapist in place of a real one because he’s the only person that’s seemed to listen and respond even though he says it’s fine I just can’t shake that feeling.

There’s probably more but. idk. everything sucks right now. sorry for the essay. I just needed to put it all down and put it somewhere. 

And just to be clear, I wouldn’t nor do I plan to harm myself or others. Frankly I’m too much of a wimp to ever do anything and I know there are many people in my life that care about me and would be sad if anything happened. But I feel like I’m really nearing my limit and am kind of scared that one day my body is just gonna give up cause it really feels like it sometimes.

"I am convinced no one around me likes me or seeks out my presence. Anxious about anxiety medication also.  I have crippling anxiety. I never feel likable in platonic relationships and settings. I don’t think people desire or crave my presence. I don’t feel like I’m romantically lovable. I have convinced myself I am a very dull and boring person and generally unworthy of people’s time and attention. I have a boyfriend who is head over heels for me and it still is not enough reassurance. I know he loves me but it still doesn’t make me ~feel~ lovable. I have quite a lot of friends. My weekends stay occupied with one social activity after another. I could throw a get together at my place and invite 30 people easily. But I don’t have the level of emotional intimacy in friendships that I am desperately craving. I have become extremely dependent upon marijuana as it’s the only thing that has ever helped my anxiety. But if it ever hits different or doesn’t give me the anti-anxiety effect, I start to panic. I feel marijuana has been the only thing holding my life together and making my life livable and worthwhile. I get so scared of developing too high of a tolerance or it not always having the same effect on me. I owe my life to this drug. It would be nice to have another medication to assist with these feelings but I am also worry about developing a tolerance over years and years with those medications. And after having been on them for so long, how destructive would coming off be for me? I genuinely want to end my life sometimes because of how bad it gets. I have seen multiple psychologists and they never seem to do much anything. I pretty much give up after 10-12 sessions because I run out of things to talk about.",anxiety

"My ongoing battle with health anxiety. Any tips?  Hello everyone ! :) 

As the title says, I battle with health anxiety. This began back in 2020 when I was infected with strep throat and months later a stomach flu. Of course COVID hit after.

To this day, anytime I feel something going on with me I tend to think the WORST. I tell myself “What if I’m badly sick?” Or “What if I don’t get this checked out soon” and basically fill my head with tons of what if questions that ultimately lead up to me possibly dying. 

Yes, I do the drastic “Googling” agenda I know I shouldn’t be doing but it’s kinda instinct at this point unfortunately. 

While I go to the gym and do my damn best to eat well and take care of myself, I’m always prone to something. I deal with allergies and while my asthma is much better, I still have it as it’s a chronic thing I’ll have forever lol. 

I was also told I have a fused heart valve which, as of now, it’s okay but eventually at age 30 I’ll have to get it checked out just to make sure I’m okay. 

My point isn’t to have sympathy for me as I’m sure many many other people may struggle with far worst but… I’m tired of always crying and thinking something is going on with me. I want to break free of this pain. 

Any tips or advice to deal with health anxiety would be greatly appreciated :) thank you",anxiety
"Scared to death At my lowest point I was getting panic attacks 5 to 10 times a day. Even then I didn't need to use Ativan very often. They would last about 2 to 10 mins. I would use cold water or air to help soothe me. After almost a year of therapy, my panic attacks were becoming way less frequent. I ended up coming off my lexapro after being on it for a long time. I was doing well with therapy plus it didn't really work well to help my anxiety.

3 months after stopping, I started to get really bad anxiety and panic attacks. Doctor prescribed be a popular med that helps with anxiety. Well I had the worst side effects from it. I had the biggest panic attack lasting 8 hours, I was shaking uncontrollably, throwing up, completely disoriented. It was the worst feeling of my life. I stopped taking it immediately. I felt like myself again less than 24 hours later. I was still anxious but I didn't feel like I was on a bad trip anymore.

Well, a few days after quitting the new med, the attacks started up, they are so severe that I was put on benzos. I take the quick dissolving tablet but still my attack doesn't really start to go away until about 2 hours after taking it. As soon as the benzos wear off another attack comes on. I can't even call it a panic attack. It is literally uncontrollable, I don't know what is triggering it and all my coping skills I've learned over the years in therapy do nothing to ease it. I've tested my blood pressure during these attacks and they are about 152/105. My normal rate is 121/79. 

I am at a loss of what to do. I can't rely on benzos forever. I see my doctor on Wednesday. I started lexapro again this week. 10 mg and I am thinking of maybe asking for a beta blocker?

I'm having a hard time eating, I've lost 5 lbs in the last week and my weight keeps going down.

"Self sabotaging thoughts  About a month ago I had some life stressors going on and my anxiety was really heightened. I have suffered anxiety on and off my entire life. I’m a 29 y/o female. I am self employed as a licensed esthetician I do lashes and makeup. This is wedding season and I travel to do makeup for wedding parties that vary in size from 4-8 people. I usually LOVE my weddings. (Amazing money, getting out of the house, making people feel beautiful, leaving there feeling like a boss ass bitch.) anyway, around the time my anxiety was first getting somewhat heightened I had a HUGE wedding. It was a party of 12 so I got an assistant which I’ve never done before. Well it ended up triggering me big time. When my assistant arrived I felt out of control of the situation and had a panic attack that I tried to conceal. I was so worried I couldn’t pull it together. So much pressure for me to do 8 people I had her do 4 and I was shaky. I ended up making it through the wedding but it was horrible to think if I had not pushed through what would have happened. I have worked so hard to build a good reputation and be where I am today and I would struggle knowing I messed up someone’s wedding day. Well ever since that experience it is really weighing on me. I had 2 weddings after that they were pretty small I had a lot of anxiety before starting but was fine once I did. I have a party of 7 this Saturday and just keep having anxiety about it even though I’m perfectly capable. What is wrong with me and how can I get out of my head? I’ve done so many weddings and they have all done amazing up until this point. I don’t want to avoid future bookings because of this. I make a lot of extra money from them and I always loved doing them. I can’t stop worrying that I will have anxiety or a panic attack while working. If I’m shaky I can’t do good work.

Have tried the strongest nerve painkillers, Oxy, Norco, ketamine, morphine, muscle relaxants, Percocet, codeine, melatonin, Isaflush, anti anxiety meds, anti viral meds, Tylenol. Most doctors I’ve brought this up to don’t believe me and just look at me like I’m stupid or think I’m making my pain up and say “that’s impossible.” Please don’t ask or suggest a drug to try. It’s ANY drug.

Read it could be the paradoxical effect and could be from an imbalance of neurotransmitters and chemicals that is making my body not react to drugs how I should be. Has anyone ever heard of this? ",anxiety
"I took in a stray kitten and it has fleas.  I found a kitten last night (yay cat distribution system) and didn’t realize until this morning that it has fleas. I was overcome with joy and love when I took in the cat that my brain didn’t think of any possible diseases or pests the kitten could carry. This morning I noticed that the cat has fleas! I felt so disgusted and because of my anxiety I have not been able to think of anything else. I think the fleas are all over my apartment, in my couch, in my bed, all over my clothes, all in my hair. I can’t stop scratching myself. I wasn’t able to take the kitten to the vet until after work. The vet gave him flea treatment. The vet also did a checkup and vaccinated. I’m back at home and I still don’t feel better. I have the kitty in the bathroom and I feel so bad because he’s in there alone. I wish I could hold him but the fleas are making so scared.

My anxiety has been getting really awful with the seasons changing, politics, and my brain convincing me every tiny thing is a threat to my existence. A big struggle of mine is finding reason to get up and fight it to get better, whether that be getting out of bed, getting out my flat to explore, or just getting off my phone. everything feels so scary right now.

liver mass found and i’m going insane hi guys. I (19F) recently just had the worst 2 weeks of my life. i was having a sharp pain where my gallbladder was and my doctor scheduled me for an ultrasound where they found a mass in my liver. i was then sent for a ct scan and my results said everything else was fine but my liver mass was like 7.2 cm and that it is most likely a benign tumor either focal nodular hyperplasia or a hepatic adenoma. dawg when i tell u i’ve been fuckin driving myself crazy cause there’s a chance it might be cancer dawwwwggg. i already had health anxiety and was constantly thinking that i might have cancer but now that they found a liver mass like i am going insane. like dude i don’t want to fuckin die bru or have cancer like i want to live so bad. i’ve just been anxious awaiting for my liver specialist appointment. my doctor read the results to me and said i have nothing to worry about just to eat healthy but bru like i am so scared.,anxiety

"Chest pain that comes and goes 

Ever since September, I (23M) have had these dull, aching chest pains (very mild, but bothersome) that are intermittent, it happens every day. They occur on the left side of my chest, right where my heart is. Sometimes it will switch to the right side but that is rare, and it has not moved to the arms or any other extremities. The chest pains themselves have sparked a few panic attacks, which I have never had before despite being diagnosed with Anxiety at a young age. 

I have taken two trips to Urgent Care with no abnormalities on EKG tests each visit. I also had a visit with my Dr. who also took an EKG and found nothing wrong. I also had bloodwork and urine taken, but nothing abnormal was found. 

It happens when I work (I work physical labor in a warehouse) and also when I rest, there is no real difference in timing. There is no pain when I press the affected area. The symptoms have not gotten worse nor better, and I have not had any other symptoms other than chest pain/discomfort. 

I have chalked it up to Anxiety or Angina. Anxiety makes sense because I have panic attacks conveniently around the same time this chest pain has started. I also don’t wake up with chest pain, and it doesn’t interfere with my sleep. But it feels just like Angina according to the internet, however I am very young and I would say I have a decent diet, although Hypertension could be a factor of my anxiety. I ingest THC to help with Anxiety a few times a week usually, I drink alcohol on special occasions. 

I still don’t have clear answers after all these visits and it worries me. It really sucks living like this not knowing what it could be. Thank you for reading in advance.

"Highly sensitive  My entire life I’ve extremely sensitive, crying at the smallest things, able to sense a change in tone in someone’s voice, knowing when someone doesn’t like me, etc. 

I’ve been doing well for a while now but today couldn’t have been worse. My friend was late meeting me (like usual), my other friend asked me for money that I had honestly forgotten to send him, and now my other friend I’m living with just asked me nicely to talk quieter on the phone because it’s late (which I didn’t realize I was being loud because I’ve got my headphones on). 

None of these are things to cry over but I’ve feel it building up all day and now I haven’t been able to stop sobbing over the last hour. 

My life has been perfect the last few months, nothing to be upset over so I just don’t understand why I get like this out of the blue. 

I haven’t been diagnosed with anxiety but I was diagnosed with depression (at age 13 but 22F now) and have always felt like I most likely do have anxiety. I can remember since I was as young as five, never quite feeling things the same way other people did, crying over everything small or big and it’s been a struggle.

"Terrified of having ALS (Left leg feels weak and achy) .  Maybe PTSD relapse? Hello everyone, I, 22(F), have been absolutely terrified of the idea of having ALS. For context I have been recently diagnosed with PTSD  after a terrible cruise vacation which had me spiral into a constant panic state and unfortunately I did suffer a concussion a little over a month ago (which makes me worried that it might have ""offset"" ALS) this is more of a paranoia than based on evidence btw.

These symptoms started last month. I have been recovering from a PTSD episode since August, I got my concussion in September and then early October is where I am spiraling til now. So in October my PCP in my crappy neighborhood clinic told me that I probably have an autoimmune disease despite me being tested for it 4 years ago and never having any symptoms for it (even now). I tested negative twice. Keep in. mind this is the same place that told me I probably have schizophrenia because I had an auditory hallucination when I was falling asleep (which, btw is a very common and normal thing). Even though I know I more than likely was fine I still had another breakdown and started to get anxious all over again.

The incident: Few days after phone call scare

I was starting to feel better about my health even though I had barely eaten and stayed in my room most of the time and decided I needed to get some food so I finally left my room and walked quite a bit to get to the store. While in line my leg randomly stopped working for a few seconds, I initially felt like my left foot was on top of some napkins that I wanted to move away but I couldn't move my leg!  Of course I was terrified and nearly had a panic attack and went to the ER who told me I was fine. However since the incident I have been getting a variety of symtpms but the most concerning one is that the leg that stopped working for a few seconds feel weak, stiff, and achy on the kneecap. I was already starting to feel stuff leading up to the big event but nothing too concerning and I think it was more of a result as me being panicky about what the PCP told me.

It's been almost a month now and I have been getting a variety of symptoms. Some have migrated to other parts of my body such as sporadic burning, muscle twitches, dizziness, and of course weakness in or the ""off feeling"" in my left leg. I've done 2 neuro tests and my neuromuscular specialist doesn't suspect MS but if the blood and MRI don't catch anything we will proceed with an EMG. I am just trying to take it day by day. My comforts are that although I am experiencing more things a lot of symptoms seem to fluctuate or have gone away such as twitching and burning so I am willing to chalk those up to anxiety. However I am worried about my leg. I wonder if it's because something different cause my leg to stop working and now I'm hyperfixated on my leg or if it is something more sinister. I also heard some people say that they had anxiety that made them ""stuck"" before but I wasn't panicking the day it happened.

Anxiety can do some crazy stuff. Let me know what you all think. I feel like I can't be the only one here.  I'll update with what happens!",anxiety
"Does anyone have hidden underlying anxiety that causes health issues? The titles says it how it is I suppose. 

The summer before college I noticed a lot of health issues. Primarily with GI tract. I would wake up in the middle of the night feeling like I had to vomit, had terrible acid reflux, and some other general GI issues. I went to the GI doctor and they immediately told me it was my anxiety causing these issues. Sure enough, once I got settled into college, they disappeared. They come back when I’m anxious about things, so it makes sense to me how. 

The weird thing was I didn’t feel actively anxious about starting college. It was kinda subliminal in a way I suppose. Just looming. 

I’m wondering if that “looming” anxiety is enough to cause health issues for people. I’m currently in a multi-month long situation which could cause looming anxiety, and I have took on more (different) GI issues that I can not solve. I’m starting to wonder if it is just looming anxiety. 

I also have trichotillmania. I often find myself pulling my hair out without realizing it. Subliminal i suppose. I wonder if my digestive issues are the same. 

Thanks! ",anxiety
"5 hour driving trip for the first time  Work trip coming up 

I have anxiety about everything but like on and off driving anxiety I guess? I have moments were I love driving but when I’m thinking about it or planning out a trip that involves driving I start imagining the worst.

I have a work trip coming up and I’ve been anxious about it for months, flipping back and forth between wanting to take the bus there or drive. It’s a 5-6 hour trip by car and with the bus it would be about 8 hours. Both options make me anxious 🙃 

I could have just not gone, this trip is voluntary, but I’m trying to be more “adventurous”, to get out of my comfort zone, and to own my decisions since I’ve already committed.

I’m pretty set on driving there at this point. 
But I’ve literally been anxious about this trip for weeks. The longest I’ve driven consecutively is 2 hours… and I’ve never driven this road before. 

I imagine for most people this is so not a big deal, so I’m trying to tell myself that and to follow what a non anxious person would do.
It’s a few days away and I’m up late again stressing. 

I’m also stressing out about possibly encountering bed bugs at the hotel and bringing them home 😭

I don’t really know what I’m looking for here lol but felt like I needed to get it out and maybe hear it will be okay?  Any advice you guys have on how to get through this period would be so appreciated 🙏🙏

"Heart palpations making life impossible  I get these things called premature atrial contractions that my doctor says is caused by anxiety. They started in my late 20s and caused me to become a hypochondriac for a bit until we got it figured out. I was on anti anxiety meds and they went away up until a few years ago.

I don’t feel them when I’m walking or moving, but laying down or sitting in the couch in the evening, my heart feels like it’s pumping out of my throat.

My therapist today said something about using exposure response so that I learn to ignore them. Which is what I had done in the past but I can also note that it was because I kept myself occupied with other hobbies. But things haven’t been going well in my primary relationship and so i try to spend more time with them but I start getting them the minute I sit down.

It’s happening in bed, too, and I just am at a loss. I don’t know if it’s because I feel so much pressure or anxiety with my spouse but I also don’t know how to change all of this other than doing what I’ve been doing which is getting up when it becomes too much and working around the house or calling a friend.

"Please help Let me start off by saying I am a 24yr old female who has been dealing with health anxiety and severe panic attacks for around two years now. A little over a month ago I woke up with a high heart rate, as well as tightness in my chest and pain in my left arm. I took a trip to the ER where they did bloodwork, EKG, chest x-rays, and a ct scan of lungs to check for pulmonary embolism. Every test came back normal. I have had a high heart rate for a long time now, which I have always been told is anxiety. I have seen a cardiologist and worn a heart monitor, had an echocardiogram done, and many blood panels which were all normal. Since my first trip to the ER a month ago my symptoms have worsened. I have constant chest pain directly over my heart, pain in my arms, neck and collar bones. My heart constantly races, and I have multiple panic attacks a day about the pains. It’s gotten to the point where I can barely eat or sleep. I constantly think I’m going to die or that something must be seriously wrong that the doctors are missing. The pain happens almost everyday but definitely worsens when under emotional stress. Could anxiety really be the root cause of this?

"Had my first panic attack while on medication I've been on antidepressants for my anxiety for a year now as that's part of where my anxiety comes from. I've been doing well for a year now to the point my doctor wanted to put me on a lower dose. Then tonight the panic attack happened. My mouth felt tingly and numb. I shot up from the bed and my chest had the familiar warm sensation, heart beating out of my damn chest, at least no pain this time.

"My sister’s health anxiety is destroying the family  My older sister has dealt with health anxiety and OCD (I think that the two are linked) since as long as I can remember. She used to confide in me about it but now she pushes me and our family away and has become resentful towards us. 

She screamed at our stepdad last night and told him that she hopes he kills himself from the guilt after she dies because he didn’t believe that she has a terminal illness and that we will all have blood on our hands when she dies. 

She becomes a different person when she thinks that she’s dying. She thought that she had kidney failure last week and the results came back that she’s fine but she is still convinced there’s something wrong. 

She had a keratin treatment (chemical hair straightening) done a couple months ago and is convinced that it is given her cancer because the hairdresser got some of the solution on her skin.
When she got home she started shouting at our mum and stepdad and broke down in tears. 

She cut off all of her hair a couple days ago and every time she leaves her room it’s to pick a fight with someone. My stepdad told me that he doesn’t know how to talk to her anymore because it’s him that she targets the most. 

She’s 19 but has spent her entire teenage years hiding away in her room and obsessing over her health. 

I don’t know how to help her. Once she has it in her head that something is wrong she becomes impossible to reason with. I want to help because it’s causing so much tension within the house.

"Anxiety triggered by exertion  Hi guys, new to Reddit. Recently been having issues with my anxiety being triggered during exertion. I never used to have this issue, it’s always been different symptoms with my anxiety, so this one’s new.

I’ve been battling it by going for walks and making myself endure each walk how I planned it and it does kind of help. Basically once I know I’m heading back home I feel much better. I’ll continue to do this sort of exposure, buuuut I need some extra help for tomorrow’s event. 

Anyone got tips for me to help cope better? I am due to walk 20 mins to my local lakes to watch fireworks tomorrow with friends and I wonna be relatively calm to the point that I can at least do this comfortably.

It’ll be dark, busy, loud and I won’t have my car to escape too, so those extra 4 factors will add to the anxiety also. I feel if I get the panic around exertion under control a bit more, the other factors I can deal with as it doesn’t particularly impact how I feel in a “I feel like I’m dying” type of way. ",anxiety
"Sertraline Day 8 So after a week on 25mg I upped to 50mg. I was really scared because from day 4 my anxiety was through the roof. Worst panic attacks I’ve had in a long time. But so far I feel okay again, praying it won’t get worse again. I have a constant nervous feeling , my hands and feet are sweating like crazy and I look wired. But no other side effects apart from that thankfully. Also, sleeping a lot better which is great. Didn’t think I’d get this far and after the day 4 anxiety kept getting worse I wanted to stop there and then. But here I am. Just need to keep going

"Dealing with this brain feeling for months, does anyone else have this? I wake feeling groggy every day, and at some point in the day I have trouble swallowing, and once that happens it stays the whole day. I don't even mean food, mostly just saliva as I have post nasal drip and need to swallow often during the day. When I am trying to do the motion and it doesn't work, it feels like my brain is spasming out or essentially not getting any oxygen. It hurts and it feels like at times this is going to kill me. It will last an entire day, had have this for weeks. Psychiatrist just gave me clonazepam which has helped at times, but not completely.

Oddly enough all of this started last April after cracking my neck at work, before that, which sent me into a manic panic attack on my drive home I never had any issues. CT scan was clear when I took one in May. Neurologist appointment is very far away. I just want to feel normal again and live my life without being afraid I am going to die from this weird issue.

"Panic attacks? I’ve had general anxiety for a few years, I had never taken medication for it until it got increasingly worse during my pregnancy, I had to be convinced but ultimately was prescribed Zoloft and it was a life changer, I could finally have a bad thought and be able to move on from it much easier. When I went back to my dr and she asked how it was working I said that I couldn’t believe this was how I was supposed to feel it was amazing. Well about the last 4 months I accidentally quit them cold turkey, I kept forgetting to take them and when I’d remember they wouldn’t be with me or it would be the wrong time of day and I didn’t want to get sleepy, so I’d take one every week or every few weeks and I think I really messed up because the anxiety has came back with a vengeance. I have had only one panic attack that I can remember and it was absolutely the scariest moment of my life, my hands seized up and would not release and they hurt so bad, it felt like someone was stacking bricks on my chest and I couldn’t speak. That’s what I assumed all panic attacks were like but now I’m starting to thank I’ve been having minor ones more frequently but I’m not sure. I don’t even know how to explain it to anyone, it feels like my insides get shaky, I can’t slow down my pulse, I feel so zoned out like I’m not even in my body and I have this overwhelming sense of doom that I can’t explain where it’s coming from. I’m actively experiencing one of these moments now which is why I decided to post here I would love to hear others experiences because right now it feels like I can’t find the words to explain to people around me about how I feel it’s so weird.

"What should I do when moving feels so hard but time is less?  I'm 19 (F). I have graduated high school; however, I am studying for one of the entrance exams. The exam takes place every year, and I gave the exam this year for the first time. Of course, I knew I needed more work and couldn't pass the exam. However, if anyone knows about India and the NEET exam, they would know what happened this year. The exam turned out to be a scam. From what I heard, people paid to get their seats, and even those who worked hard and deserved seats couldn't get in. The exam itself is very competitive, and on top of that, this irrational behavior from such a respected field broke me. It's not the fact that I'm discouraged that I couldn't pass the exam; it's the fact that how unfair it is, almost to the point I am finding it so hard to believe and devote time to the exam again. I cannot handle betrayal, and it wounds me a lot. This is why trusting this exam again and just giving it a shot after so much injustice just isn't right to me.

It also feels like, in India, doctors aren't respected enough. Recently, a rape case also occurred where a girl doctor was raped, which just shattered me to the core. I feel so bad; I just want to run away from this country.

I know I might be thinking in black and white. I'll admit my family, even society, thinks that passing an exam is all you need to do to prove your worth. I understand about taking other paths. Life is too short to brood over an exam. But it's the fact that I promised myself to give a shot to this exam. I told my mom this is the last time I'll ever give a chance to the exam. But I physically cannot find the motivation to just do it. My mom notices me and asks me why I'm not studying. It's not like she's pressuring me. To her, it's uncommon to see me just lying in bed. The reason why I can't even rest when I'm resting is that I know time is running out, and what if I lose the opportunity? I'm being hard on myself; I know. Just to make it clear, I don't have suicidal thoughts at all and I'm pretty sure that I would never take a drastic step for such a small exam. I know life moves on and I would probably feel light after the exam is over. But rn, I don't know what to do, how to rest without feeling guilty. Much of my life, I've been an excellent student, and I always had high expectations of myself. But now that it's crushing me, I realize that it's very toxic to hold onto the belief that results would only show my worth.

I have other plans in my mind, which I've thought of doing if I fail this exam again. But I'm not sure how to spend these few months. Do I give this exam a shot? How can I do it? Do I take it easy? It's like living anxiously, knowing my body doesn't want to do what betrayed the very belief of mine but still finding it hard to rest because I don't want to feel stuck.

"What happened? Hi, lately I've been wondering if maybe I have anxiety. In recent months I've had two experiences that could have been anxiety or panic attacks, but I'm not sure. I would really like some input on these situations.

Experience 1 (Kinda long-winded, sorry):

I was visiting Seattle with my mom, and as always when traveling I felt less comfortable than at home. On one day, I felt on-edge and jumpy in general but for no specific reason. It started with the eerily quiet vibe of our hotel that was patrolled by a security guard. Then later I saw a kid with his parents who were wasted on the sidewalk. After that, my mom and I visited a glass art museum. It was fascinating, but when I walked past an exhibit, all at once I felt super off-balance and not in control of my body. I had the sudden invasive thought that I could easily fall and smash into the intricate glass display. From then on I felt very uncomfortable and a little out of breath. Following the museum experience, I had another concerning thought when our car backed over a piece of trash. The idea popped into my head that it was a person or animal, which I know sounds insane.

Now, here is where I started to panic - if that's even the right term to use. Back at the hotel, my mom and I put on some TV. I felt very overwhelmed and I suddenly felt so, so incredibly scared. I started crying and went over to my mom. The draft in the hotel or other residents caused a distant sound that could have been doors opening and closing, but it started to terrify me. I thought I was going to die in that hotel room, and I was bawling uncontrollably. It was the most terrified I've ever been, even though nothing was actually wrong. At the worst point, I thought my mom maybe wasn't real while I was huddled up against her. God it was so scary; I hate to think about it.

The next day I was exhausted. My mom wanted to visit another, smaller art gallery. When I got inside, I got a little bit breathless and teary-eyed and was relieved when we left.

Experience 2:

This one is a lot milder. I recently stopped drinking coffee because of my nerves, but one day after school I couldn't resist a pumpkin cold brew. I drank it on my walk home. By the time I arrived, my nerves were really acting up, but it was nothing I hadn't felt before.

This is when things started to change. I was scrolling on my phone, and I came across an obviously fake video that spooked me nonetheless. It was stupid - about this guy who kept hearing his own voice talking back to him in his dimly lit apartment. I put my phone down, and my nerves started to bubble up. I started to see movements in the corner of my eyes that disappeared right away. I looked at my hands and they didn't feel like my own, so I tried to stop looking at them. There was a pulsing in my arm, and I felt a little breathless. I also had a minor pain in my chest, which I've read is a common panic symptom.

However, after maybe 5 minutes of sitting still and taking deep breaths, the symptoms subsided. It was not bad at all.

If you read this whole thing, I really would appreciate an opinion on these experiences; It would be very helpful. Thank you!",anxiety
"Does your heart race with a panic attack? *Trigger, health*
Hi everyone,

I just had what I'm guessing is a full blown panic attack...

After I eat I seem to get anxiety, I am recovered from eating disorders but I get weird anxiety over food I'm guessing so I was feeling panicky then had to take a work call, I stupidly took my heart rate and it was 96 and then I just full blown panicked, took it again while feeling that way, it was about 120 and I freaked out, my head was racing like I will have a mental breakdown, I need to see a doctor/hospital, do I have SVT, it's like I was talking myself into it more but couldn't control it and then my heart was pounding and pulse was racing...Normally my BP is about 117/72 and my resting heart rate is 72-84

I am very paranoid about my heart since I had Covid in 2022..Basically rules changed and I tried to take my little one to school, I didn't want to take public transport but had no choice, I kept thinking about all the people I could make ill, I barely ate because of the stomach pains and was holding a heavy school bag...Suddenly everything started to spin and I checked my pulse and it was full blown racing...I called the ambulance and they said exhaustion and Covid symptoms, I had an ECG

Since then I've been extremely paranoid, checking my pulse loads, I had another ECG in Jan 2023 and they offered it to try calm me down, it showed my heart was racing but I had anxiety, I needed a nasal camera in Dec 2022 and they had a pulse oxygen clip on my finger and a BP monitor, noone said anything then either and in Aug 2023 I was diagnosed with low iron anemia and then low iron after..I also had a cancer scare which I've been fixating on again lately even though I got the all clear

All ECGs they said were normal besides me being stressed, they were 10 minutes, laying down

I've had multipe heart racing things in the past two weeks but I've been thinking about alot of trauma I've bottled up, I'm not sure it's related but I'm scared for my health, when it happens I get this awful feeling come over me and then after I just shake when my pulse has calmed down 

Thankyou ",anxiety

"Scared of losing control of myself  Greetings everyone.

I was crippled by a new fear. The fear of psychosis/schizophrenia. This happened to me a couple of days ago and it really bothers me.
It started with the fact that about 5-6 days ago, I started having this strange feeling in my head. Heavy head, 'drunk' feeling, dizziness, heavy eyes, wind in the ears. Then I started to feel as if I was not present in my body. Confused, scared, I cried for everything, forgetful, head full of negative thoughts that just wouldn't stop. And of course my mistake was that I went to Google to analyze what it means. I got results for psychosis, schizophrenia, etc. I felt absolute pure horror. Now I'm even more worried that I'll just lose control and develop this. I'm even more worried because this fear came out of nowhere. And if I want something thanks to my anxiety, it's control. I'm afraid I'd just lose that and end up in a hospital forever, out of my mind.

I am 27 years old and a student. Currently in working on completing my master's thesis. I've been through a lot of hard things in my life so I don't want something like this to happen to me and ruin all my hard work that I put into this. And situations like this, when everything goes downhill, throw me completely off track. I've been diagnosed with anxiety, panic disorder and OCD since teenage/childhood years.

I'm also currently on the second day of my period and I don't know if that could also be to blame. I have PCOS and suspected endometriosis. I don't know if the hormones are contributing to this as well but all I know is, that I want it to stop.

Thank you for your help. Maybe someone can successfully talk some sense into me. x",anxiety
"If I need to tell my therapist to teach me coping skills, are they the wrong therapist for me? I've been receiving therapy for around a month now. I meet with my clinician once every week.

I was extremely happy going in to it because I didn't want to be depressed and anxious about everything anymore. But when I talked to my therapist i kind of didn't feel too impressed. Sorry, I know how arrogant this sounds. I think they're just not the right one for me...?

But I digress, I practiced what I preach and continued to see this therapist despite being kind of unimpressed. It's kind of early. Perhaps I'm just being too pessimistic...

But idk... I think this is my fourth or fifth time seeing them now and I kind of feel like nothing is actually working...

Don't get me wrong. I'm happy my therapist told me x and y. But the big issue is - I need a job. I need to make money... I don't got a lot of money left and pretty soon I will be homeless... I'd like to be able to talk to a coworker and not feel threatened and or competitive. it ruined a ton of my relationships with coworkers. And not just coworkers. But basically family and friends too...!

My therapist is teaching me a lot of things, such as what depression is and how each example I'm giving him of my past events are affecting my life. But I don't think they are helpful. I feel like I am just talking to a robot. If I don't start the conversation, my therapist doesn't talk to me. It's kind of awkward.. most of the things they tell me, it's kind of just them reading in the between the lines and rephrasing what I said back to me.

Today felt extremely bad because I had to take a bus to see the therapist (I don't usually take the bus). I got a bit confused with the bus system so I texted my therapist if it was okay I was going to be a little late. They text back and said ""it's okay. We can have a shorter session today"". Which made me feel like A) extremely disrespected B) I wasnt getting my money's worth

And then to top it off. My therapist always looks at the time and tells me something along the lines of ""oops, won't you look at that. We've been talking for so long. Times flies by"". When in reality I feel like I was the only one doing any sort of talking.

I need resources like coping skills. The reason I came here in the first place today was because my therapists told me we'd work on breathing techniques and stuff to stop feeling anxious in a certain scenario. But whenever I get to see my therapist, they always don't remember what we were talking about and it makes me feel like I'm a unimportant or something.

After a whole month with them, I was finally thinking it's time to look for a different therapist, but I can't talk to them about it because I'm afraid of confrontations and stuff. I get anxiety thinking about it. I don't got family or friends and currently nobody knows I'm seeing a therapist for depression (I was clinically diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder here, but the initial reason I came to therapy was because I think I knew I had depression).

I don't want to be mean but I think I'm just wasting time... It's cool I'm finally brushing my teeth and taking a shower like normal again, now. I think my therapist kind of helped steer me towards this progress, but it's off course... Hopefully somebody understands what I mean... Because I can't find the correct words and things to say from time to time...",anxiety

"Recent panic attacked had caused new anxiety Hi everyone. I have never posted in a Reddit sub before so this is all new to me. Sorry in advance if there are any grammar issues or misspelling. Also I have never really dealt with anxiety before this. 

3 days ago I had a my first ever severe panic attack while having a late night snack and gaming. I immediately ran up to my fiancés and I’s room and woke up her up asked her to take me to the hospital. I really thought I was having a heart attack. I am overweight so I immediately thought the worst. The hospital trip was fine, blood work came back fine, thyroid looked perfectly normal, blood pressure was a little high, but nothing to freak over. Now ever since this had happened it’s like it has unlocked a level of anxiety that I have never experienced before. I have been constantly overthinking EVERYTHING it’s like my brain refuses to shut up for even a second. I feel like I’m in a revolving door. Constant sweating and freaking out. My stomach is in shambles (stomach pain and diarrhea) and anytime I try to eat anything, healthy or not my body acts like it’s going into shutdown mode. Eating is when I feel my anxiety at its highest. It’s like my brain has linked eating to my sever panic attack that I had and will barely let me eating anything at all let alone hold on down. It’s like my brain thinks if I eat it’s going to cause another panic attack and I might die. This new anxiety has made me feel so on edge ever since this event. I feel like I’m starting to go crazy. This is all so new to me. Any tips or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance. ",anxiety
"Muteness Hi everybody,

So ever since I remember I had this thing where I just froze, unable to speak in stressful situations. Usually when I felt i dissapointed someone, or I had to talk about feelings, and to this day I cannot talk when I have to talk feelings. It usually comes with crying and I can usually nod but any other type of communication I just can't do it. I have everything I want to say on repeat in my head I keep telling myself to just talk yet I can't.

And basically I'm just interested if someone knows what it is or how to overcome this. I've read about selective mutism but I don't think it's that because  the diagnostic criteria requires isolation, effect on social life/education and consistency and with me this muteness only truly happens with feelings talk.

"Physical symptoms of anxiety during grieving Hey all,

I’ve had health anxiety for years. I’ve recently been triggered by my dads lengthy illness, surgeries and ultimately death. I was hoping to hear others physical symptoms and how they cope with them. 

My symptoms started in July with chest pain in the center of my chest and palpitations that got worse at night. I had two urgent care visits, EKGS (normal) and now ultimately am wearing a heart monitor with upcoming echo/stress test. 

The chest pain has been replaced with tingling arms and legs. At first it was once in awhile, a sleepy foot, etc. Since his death Friday, I have had continuous tingling and cold arms/legs. I also feel like I always have to pee, no UTI. 

I have a neurologist who wants me to rule out MS as I previously hit my head and triggered migraines due to mild traumatic brain injury. 

She said she didn’t think I should worry as MS patients don’t have short bouts of symptoms, but rather larger ones. Now she’s  urging me to get my MRI done so I have one coming Tuesday. Trying to calm myself down in the meantime. I have been trying to keep dad alive since July and I think I overdid it and am heading into a bad place physically with my brain and heart.

"My mom almost died cause of me and I hate myself Hey this is my first time posting here but I'm just seeing black rn.
I'm a 25 year old female struggling with health anxiety for more then a decade.
For the entire time my mom has been my support, she's the most important person in my life and she loves me very much but things just got too much for her.
For about a week I got some really bad anxiety about a certain symptom and went to the doctor who told it's nothing but I didn't believe him and I told my mom that on the phone right after the appointment and she started crying saying it's never going to end.

I started a new anxiety medication after the last one didn't work and when I got home(I live by myself) my mom called me on a video call to see that I'm taking the new med and I saw she looked distressed so I told her everything will be fine once the new med will kick in and just went to sleep to calm my mind thinking that's where it ends....

I was dead wrong.

2 hours later I was awaken by a phone call from my mom's boyfriend who lives with her(we have a father daughter relationship)
and just screamed at me saying he came home early to my mom being blue, half breathing and surrounded by her own vomit after she had an extreme panic attack and her body collapsed, an ambulance came and gave her an adrenaline shot. I was just shocked and didn't understand fully because I was still sleepy, he yelled at me saying I'm a danger to her and that if I'll try to call any of them they won't answer and hang up.

I got a bad BAD anxiety attack and my best friend came to be with me.
After a few hours he started sending me awful texts saying that I'm disgusting and I should be ashamed of myself for doing this to my mom, saying that if I dare to call them I'll get hospitalized at a mental hospital and that now I have a ""business"" with him. I almost fainted from my attack after that.

"My Journey (TRIGGER WARNING - Heart and Panic Attack related) Hello everyone, my name is Brandon. About 2 years ago I had my first >!panic attack!<. I was at work, college gym job, sit at a desk and just look out for people. I was in a club that I really cared about and was messaging someone about a project when I suddenly felt a pulsing sensation coming from my heart. It felt warm and shakey, but it was distrubing. I got up, checked myself thought it was weird. It happened one more time and I knew something wasn't right. This feeling of doom would happen every minute and at that point I had told a peer and had them call an ambulance because like many people having a panic attack I thought my heart was failing.

ER came, normal heart rhythm, above average resting heart rate because I was scared, but they said I only need to go to the hospital if I'm that worried so I did. They did an X-ray, EKG, blood pressure, you name it. All good. However, after my time there I was back at my apartment extremely distrubed by it. I've always been a nervous kid but never did I think something like that could just happen out of the blue. Nights after that day were horrible. Laying down to go to sleep felt like counting seconds, deeply afraid of it happening out of nowhere again. A week or two later it happened again, I called the police and they sent another ambulance. EKG, blood pressure, I was fine. 

My recovery starts here, where I decided college was giving me way too much stress. I went back home, went to a Cardiologist to ease my mind. Months and months of daily battles convincing myself I couldn't excercise or get too emotional. I was at the point where I needed medication. But unlike many of y'all, I started looking at life different, dealing with stress in every kind of wayt, and I thankfully did not take any meds. My heart goes out to all of you who have severe cases where it is necessary, but I'm extremely proud that I got myself in check before it went that far.

Now I'm looking back into going to college again, I work, and I have routines and protocols that help my emotions and midset be regulated. I know my journey isn't as long or as painful as some, but that fear is something I never want to endure again.",anxiety

Ever since then it’s been a daily struggle where I have anxiety from morning until night. I can’t function the same as I used to. I’ve tried 5 different medications nothing seems to work. Some days are better some days are the same as day 1.

"I’m at My Wits End I just need to type this out.

I’m so frustrated. I have severe generalized anxiety disorder as well as PTSD that causes me to be hyper vigilant. It’s hard to work. I have a low stress job, but I’m in an office 8-5 Monday through Friday and the level of anxiety I have just from being out of my house and around people is absurd. There are days where it’s almost unbearable to sit at my desk and do nothing because my anxiety is so high, to the point I’ve almost had to go home early (except that also makes me anxious). I was in therapy 1-3 times a week for four months while recovering from an eating disorder (something I was using to cope with my anxiety temporarily). I’ve been in therapy before as well. I have yet to find a strategy that helps me lower my baseline anxiety. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist and she’s at the point where she doesn’t really know what to do either. Buspar makes me so lethargic and dizzy that I can’t get up. Hydroxyzine makes me too tired for daily use. Benzodiazepines are only for short term use and I need a long term solution (I’ve been dealing with anxiety since I was 10). Gabapentin didn’t help with my anxiety. Her next choice was Rexulti, which I won’t take because it lowers blood pressure and mine already runs low so I might pass out if it gets lower. I won’t take SSRIs or SNRIs after ending up in the hospital while taking Prozac. I feel like I’ve tried to very thing. I don’t want to keep taking medication. I’m so sick of the side effects, on top of the fact that I’m having other health issues I’m trying to figure out (I keep almost passing out at least once a day).

I don’t want anxiety to keep me from living my life. I have ambitions and dreams. But the longer this goes on the more I wonder if I’m going to have to call it and live off disability pay because I can’t be in public. My last effort is trying a psychiatric service dog and praying that that’ll make it so I can work and maybe even handle social events like concerts or shows without panic attacks. I’m planning on getting a puppy around Christmas and it’ll take months to get basic training done, but maybe it’ll be worth it. I hope so.",anxiety
"Everyone and everything makes me anxious I'm feeling incredibly exhausted and depressed. The thought of going to school fills me with anxiety, and I've completely lost my motivation to continue, and im constantly absent in some of my classed. I'm seriously considering dropping out, but I know that's not a realistic option in a third-world country where a college degree is essential for even a minimum-wage job.

Taking a gap year seems appealing, but I'm worried it would be a waste of time and academic progress and my family would most likely not support it either. I've chosen a course that doesn't interest me, and I lack any real ambition or drive. No course in general interests me. All I want to do is stay in bed and avoid the world. I can't imagine myself having a successful career.

I've tried to force myself to enjoy school and complete assignments, but I always fall back into procrastination and negativity. I've sought help from a school counselor and tried to followed her advice, but I keep relapsing.

I have no idea what to do, i genuienly need help. I have no one to talk to about this. I came to reddit as a last resort.",anxiety

"Stomach issues and heartburn causing me to spiral  I’ve always had issues with heartburn once in a while after a certain meal but recently it’s felt worse.

I find myself questioning if I'm going to be okay or take a total tailspin. Anybody been here and made it out okay? I'm starting to panic and think I can't do it.

"My anxiety gets in the way of my entire life? I struggle to meet new friends, so I cling to the ones I have. But I lost a close friend and now I'm down to like 1. I feel like everywhere I go people don't like me, I don't fit in, so I just show up and leave (like school or work). Then I feel lonely and sad because I couldn't make any friends, when other people do it so easily.



It gets in the way of my relationship too because I always think I'm ugly, not good enough, I can't be in the moment and just calm down. I always have so much on my mind and everything feels like a big thing to me. So I can't just let my guard down and feel present and peaceful.

  
It affects my career because I give up on every job or career idea so easily because I'm scared I won't be good enough, or I don't know how to get started, and I have nobody to ask for help.

  
The world is going mad and of course that doesn't help because it's just more things for me to be anxious about. My entire personality is different now because I can't even have fun or be a generally happy person anymore. Therapy didn't help, nor did meds. What do I do?",anxiety

"I don't believe I have anxiety what is this? Doctors keep saying i have anxiety but I feel I have control and am able to control myself, the issue for me feels like more of a physiological response that causes increased anxiety for me. As an example there's times where I get super derealized which will typically make me anxious, I was horrible at managing that before but now I feel i am able to put up with it and know im safe and feel reassured that I will be fine once I get rest or something and know its more temporary. when I go on long drives I feel really really weird getting out of the car, like almost dizzy and derealizaed also, and most the time im lacking energy. I feel unable to do work and feel my brain is always numbed out and disconnected from everything instead of feeling what I would consider to be normal. I had low cortisol months ago in response to an acth stimulation test and recently got my cortisol levels checked again and my acth which were normal but didn't do the stimulation test again, if anything was abnormal the acth should have been high. I assumed this was the issue for months but now I really don't know all I know is im never taking anxiety medication again because it fucked me up so bad last time, lexapro and buspirone caused me so much pain and fucked up my brain over time. I was so tired i felt like I was dying also it fucked me up bad when i smoked weed while on it, I was screaming and almost hallucinating and thought I died for a second. I also took Accutane a few years ago and that gave me brain fog also. I don't trust medications now and it honestly seems remarkable there's so many people on these subreddits that say they've tried so many medications and act like they love medication. I assume these people are just so far gone now and don't realize it because our brain chemistry is so sensitive no one understands. So I ask what am i supposed to do because I don't know anymore and my endocrinologist said hes not rescheduling an appointment if everything comes back normal. I've had other very clear and obvious symptoms for other physical issues I've had and what im starting to learn about the medical establishments is they don't really commonly diagnose people, I never get clear answers even after years. Is anyone else struggling with this because this is bullshit and there has to be a better approach to all this. Thankyou.",anxiety

"Constant Air hunger causing me to lose sleep I always feel like I have the need to yawn. It has gotten to the point where I lose sleep because I wake up and feel like I have to yawn and can't fall back asleep. It's gotten worse lately, for some reason I can no longer have a fulfilling yawn so I usually end up sitting there in the middle of the night trying to get a satisfying yawn off to sleep.

"Tips to reduce anxiety while living in a stressful environment 

Hello everyone.

I’m looking for tips to reduce anxiety while living in a stress full environment. Context: 
I’m living in a appartement complex for 4 years now and unfortunately my upstairs neighbour started to make a lot of noise 2 years ago. The years before that I was never bothered. I was always laying in bed and hyper focusing at every sound he maked at one point.

I’m currently wearing ANC headphones every time I’m home and earplugs for sleep and they work wonders with cancelling out the noises he makes. To be honest he doesn’t make more noise than an average neighbour but I’m just afraid for every noise he makes because of the anxiety. It feels like i made it worse in my head than how it really is. When I’m somewhere else I don’t mind noises like this. Like when I’m at my GF place I’m not bothered by her neighbour who also makes a lot of noise. If feels like my nervous system doesn’t feel safe at home and I’m always on high alert, even though wearing headphones.

Trust me that I already tried talking to him and the rental company, I’ve tried everything in that regard. In the end I think that moving out is the best for me but that’s not really an option in the short term.

I’m hoping you can help me with maybe some tips/ insights on how to reduce anxiety while living in an anxiety/ stressful environment? People with same situations? 
I just really want to recover/ reduce stress and anxiety and hope I can even though living in a stressfull environment

"Struggling with control I have dealt with anxiety since I was very little, I have overcome a lot of it. I used to have severe social anxiety with years of help, medication and exposure I was able to get mostly over that, however now I seem to be struggling with the next anxiety related issue, control. 

I haven’t seen my therapist or psychiatrist in a couple years now (yes, I made an appointment but unfortunately they can’t see me until February). But my control issues are kind of spiraling, causing me once again a lot of anxiety. I do want to mention I am on 100mg Zoloft and Xanax as needed.

I am in a management position at work, I am in charge and I seem to be able to mostly control what happens there, except on my two days off I get very anxious about not being there to make sure everything goes as it’s supposed to. Making it hard to enjoy my days off. 

This is however not limited to work only, at home I get very anxious regarding losing control over things. For example, my husband’s son (adult) leaves his stuff everywhere, and is not very good about cleaning up after himself. No matter how often I have asked or my husband, he still forgets and I have to remind myself that we are all human and forget things and make mistakes. But it gets me really worked up, causing me to almost go in a panic attack, where my husband is a lot more laid back and tells me it’s not worth stressing over, and to just remind him.

These are just a couple examples of the many things where the lack of control makes me extremely anxious. I hate being this kind of person but can not seem to get myself to relax when there is not plans in place, when someone else makes me late to something, or when it comes to work on my days off.. 

Anybody else having this issue and can provide me with some guidance?",anxiety

"Stress hives when talking to one person Hello!
I wanted to see if anyone else gets these, and what they do to help get rid of them. Or any tips at all really.
I usually get flushing/hives going from my chest to neck and face when I’m stressed. 
However, for the past year I have gotten these almost every time I’ve talked with my boss. And most of the time we’re not talking about stressful topics! We work in HR, so it can be a lot at times. We’ve worked together for 5 years and my boss can be a bit much at times, but is a good person.
However, my hives are annoying me so much. I’ve tried hiding them with turtlenecks, to wearing checks and saying “f it”, to talking about getting them and nothing seems to help. I’m thinking of trying makeup next? I really don’t know.

"Physically sick every morning with anxiety, looking for hope Hi everyone, I’m writing to hopefully get some tips (or really just understanding) from people who go through this too. I’ve been working on my anxiety/panic disorder for over 10 years now - different therapists, meds, in patient, etc - but finally have been diagnosed with OCD and a mood disorder and am gaining some control back.

That said, it’s all still incredibly hard for me and I struggle immensely everyday. Specifically, the mornings are hardest. I wake up sick to my stomach and often times, even still, get physically sick. I have a list of tools of course, meditations, games, podcasts, DBT actions, that I do but everyday is the same struggle. I know it may never go away. This may just be how my brain works and I know I can still live a great life alongside it (so they say) but in the meantime it’s incredibly challenging and makes me feel defeated everyday.

I’m also starting a new job in a week that will be in person, after working remote since the pandemic. I’m really worried about my anxiety being so bad and impacting my ability to get to work on time and actually do a good job. I’ve been under immense stress this past year so this is also a factor in my anxiety. But I’m just writing here to see if others have this too - where the panic is so bad in the morning you can’t even really get up. What do you do? How do you function?

"My Uber driver had a panic attack mid-ride. Here's what happened. It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.

He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!

&#x200B;

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: ""Sorry I have to pull over."" I reply: ""Ok is everything alright?."" He says ""Sorry having a panic attack.""

I remained calm and told him, ""Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.""

&#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways.

"At the end of my first ever session my therapist said something I’ll never forget EDIT: WOW! Thank you so much guys for your kind words! I’m in the UK and have just woke up to all of this positivity. I knew reddit was an awesome place but this has just confirmed it even more. We all deserve contentment, thank you so much 💕

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‘is it a big deal for you?’ I said, ‘yes, massively’ and she just simply replied ‘well then it’s a big deal...’, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it’s me that matters and someone else not thinking it’s serious does NOT invalidate that. I’m always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won’t judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it’s a serious problem to you. Your problems are all valid and they’re all worth fixing guys, don’t ever forget that xx",anxiety

"It's so frustrating when society wants to be all ""mental health awareness"" but when it comes to the actual symptoms of anxiety and other mental illnesses or being slightly low functioning, you're suddenly condemned for showing them The company that I worked for: ""Hey it's mental health week! Here is a pdf on how to treat people with kindness and always be mindful of others and what they might go through!""

The same company after mental health week: ""Oh what? You're overwhelmed with stress and you're showing side effects of the workload you're carrying while panicking and taking a breather? Meet me at the office after work because this behaviour is unacceptable and unprofessional compared to your neurotypical co-workers that can carry the job normally.""

"Anxiety Pro Tip: Anxiety thrives on your avoidance. If you have an anxiety-provoking task to do, make it your first task of the day. Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind. Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat. This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. 

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

"Does anyone else constantly feel like they’ve done something wrong after social interactions? Basically the title. I constantly feel like I’ve done or said something wrong or offensive and somebody is mad at me after social interactions. Especially with my family and friends. Even if the interactions ended positively and with hugs goodbye and such. I don’t have a bad relationship with any of them. I don’t consider myself anti social. I’ve mentioned this to my husband and some friends and have been told it’s all in my head basically(in the nicest way possible). My husband will reassure me that I’ve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day. It happens all the time. He and others will say even if someone is mad at me that they’ll get over it, probably before I even see them again and I shouldn’t worry about it, but for some reason I can’t shake the guilty feeling. Is this just me?

"I don't think a lot of people realise how much of a disability anxiety can be. Confidence is 75% of the battle in life. Jobs, partners, friends, etc. it's all down to being confident. You may not actually know what you're doing but being confident will convince all those around you. 

With anxiety, you will be constantly doubting yourself, thinking you can't do it. Trying to talk yourself out of daunting situations, and as such struggling to grow as a person.

It can be hard for people to understand how much of a disadvantage this puts you in. It's harder to make friends and socialise, date, work, and even things like phoning the doctor, driving, and shopping can feel like too much to handle. 

Constant anxiety is so incredibly unhealthy for your psyche yet people without anxiety often can't understand this. Instead we appear a bit shy, maybe even lazy, but they don't know what it feels like to have this affliction",anxiety

"I actually did it. Found an amazing new job in a much better city, faced my boss to quit my current job. Found a house, turned on utilities, and scheduled movers. I'm not going to lie. It was hell.

It really made clear that the only way to deal with things is literally just to face them head on. I wasn't going to have this amazing new house or job unless I pushed myself through. Period. 

If you're going through something and its hard to follow through, or hard to even start. Just try and think about the end goal, not the process. It doesnt make it easy.

If you’re starting quarantine or are obligated to stay home just like we are, I promise you’ll get used to it. And not used to it in a negative way! There are so many things you can do at home: I baked so many cakes, I’m trying to do the splits, I’m reading all the books I never got a chance to read. Isolation is reaaally not that bad.

"Healthy people talk about anxiety as if it’s something you can control... “Just breathe!” “Think positively.” “Worrying only makes you suffer twice.” Ya know, those kinds of saying. 

I wish it was that easy. If I could control it, it wouldn’t be called an illness. 

This morning I woke up feeling perfectly fine (which is rare), was sitting on my couch reading then all of the sudden, my heart started beating so fast for no fucking reason, and I started hyperventilating. It took like 2 hours to collect myself and I had no idea what that whole episode was about.

So don’t tell me it’s something I can control, I had a panic attack while thinking about literally nothing.

"I took a blanket and a hot water bottle out to a homeless man sleeping under the stairs on my apartment building. I'm shaking and feel faint but am proud I did it. It's about 2 degrees Celsius at night where I live right now, for context. As I arrived home late this evening I saw a homeless man sleeping under some building insulation fabric in the outdoor stairwell of my apartment building. 

As soon as I got inside my nice toasty apartment I couldn't stop thinking about how the poor guy must be freezing. I couldn't help but feel such an aching sadness that so many people just would walk past, not doing anything because of their discomfort, just like the discomfort I was feeling. I decided fuck it, show this guy the care and common decency you would want if you were in a similar situation. I found a spare blanket I had, nice and fuzzy and warm, and a hot water bottle I don't use and filled it up with hot boiled water. I was shaking so hard at this point and almost chickened out. 

Barely getting my key in the door to unlock my deadbolt as I was shaking so much, I forced myself to walk outside to him with the blanket and hot water bottle. I apologised for disturbing him, and simply said he must be freezing and to keep both items. He told me I was a gem, and thanked me.

Im back inside my apartment now, feeling like I'm about to faint from the adrenalin and starting to cry from the stress of the situation, but I am so proud of myself. I conquered the anxiety today in favour of my gut feeling and desire to act on my belief of kindness to all.

"Does anybody else have anxiety on your days off because you are “wasting” it doing nothing? I have been like this for years but I feel it’s been worse lately because of COVID and the fact that I’ve been working from home. I always felt anxious/guilty when I would relax, hangout inside and play video games on my days off by myself. I felt like I was supposed to be doing something productive, exercising the dog, etc. But I was working a more labor intensive job before. I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don’t have plans, I’m still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it’s beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I’m off so I feel less guilty.) I also hate the heat so when it’s too hot, I don’t want to be outside. AND I usually get house chores done on my first day off so I can relax later but I still am anxious all day because I’m relaxing and playing video games. I feel like I waste my all my days off thinking of things I SHOULD have done and then when I go back to work, I feel like I wasted all my days off thinking of things I should be doing instead of mentally relaxing. I’ve honestly found myself either drinking or getting High more on my days off just so I can forget these feelings and relax.

I bought myself a whole pizza when I got there and SMASHED IT BC I FUCKING DESERVED THAT SHIT hahahahah

It’s literally 1:45 am and I’m so fucking happy. If you’re reading this and you’re too scared to do something, DO IT. On the other side of fear is freedom. I feel like I just beat a boss level. 

Good night guys, sending you all good vibes.

If you're reading this it means I did it I'm really socially anxious and thinking about posting this is making it hard to breath and making me shake but I'm trying to get better and if you're reading this then it means I am taking a small step towards my goal and this is my first post so I'm even more anxious. I'm trying so hard from crying and deleting this post. I've probably wrote 50 different sentences and deleted them thinking it's not good enough and that people would be upset. I really don't want to but I got to try. It's been 15-20 minuets since I started to type all of this  and I'm really  scared on posting it. Please don't be too hard on me... I'm sorry for  the mess of the post  but if you're reading this it means I did it and thank you for reading.,anxiety
"anyone else get anxiety attacks from memories of bad/cringy/nasty stuff from the past? I feel like I've become a shit ton better as a person, but there are those nights that make me relive all those bad moments and I beat myself up so much that I get seriously messed up. 

What I wouldn't give to go back and do it all over the right way again..That way, I might've made better friends who would've lasted through maybe?

Or maybe these experiences, they've made me better as a person? They've shaped me? I dont know at this point.

"Does anyone else get angry at themself for not being the person they want to be because of their anxiety? As the title of the post suggests, I get angry at myself for not being able to speak up when I should, say things in meetings when I should (for fear of being judged, looking stupid etc). It's like I have a real version of myself in my head that I want to be and I get annoyed at the anxious, insecure version of myself that I feel I am forced to show to the world because of my anxiety. Does anyone else have this feeling? I beat myself up daily for not feeling able to be there person I want to be particularly in a work context as often I feel I can't speak out in meetings in particular or when someone says something I disagree with. On the occasions where I do speak out I fear it comes across as aggression. It's a daily battle I feel I struggle to win.",anxiety

I just want to relax and not feel like I'm a total idiot by just interacting with others. I try to constantly fight it by telling myself i did nothing wrong, but the moment i don't fight it, i get back on the anxiety circle.

"I lost my companion of 18 years. People don’t understand how important a pet can be for people with anxiety/mental illness. I adopted my cat as a kitten when I was in grad school. I would not be where I am in my life without his love. Pets hold a special place for people with anxiety.  He was there providing comfort when I had bad days. He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn’t have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds.

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don’t know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every “please” and “thank you” is love. Even when something is someone’s job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, “I love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.”

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, “I will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.”

Keep your promise to yourself.

Tell yourself “I love you, sweetheart.”

When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return.

Pick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, “I love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It’s okay. I got this.” (Even if you just say it in your head).

Radiate love and safety. Receive love and safety.

I love you.

"Does anyone else get avoidance anxiety from text messages, emails, Reddit mail, any electronic correspondence? Like I enjoy chatting with people in person, over the phone I don’t mind, either. With new people I get slight anxiety but it’s not crippling in any way. 

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don’t always feel like answering at the moment so I’ll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it’s a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don’t feel this way is when I’m either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don’t go to the gym (usual fear release) and there’s no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. 

I’m curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won’t avoid your replies 😆

=========

Edit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else’s experiences too. 

I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that’s part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.

"People don't want to admit this but Anxietys root cause is because of the people you were raised with Yes we can say ""oh stop blaming your parents"" but the truth is, the reason why most are struggling with anxiety is because you had guardians who didn't do a good job of making you confident about yourself. Yes you can say its ""genetics"" but even then, nurture can either make the condition better or worse. You are raised with these people your whole life, the people that surround you growing up effect you whether you like to admit it or not. Maybe your anxious all the time because your parents would throw temper tantrums every time you made mistakes and that manifested later on in to your adulthood, maybe your anxious because you had Authoritarian parents that didn't allow you to grow socially, maybe you are genetically prone to being more anxious and the people you were raised with only enhanced that feeling etc.

All I'm saying is, it's so underrated how much parents can affect there children growing up. It can make life alot more difficult than it should be if your not raised with the right people. 

To adults who are going through anxiety, yes its tougher for us but take it one step at a time. Don't compare yourself to others because they didn't live your life. They didn't face the troubles that you did, every small step you take is progress. I have a toxic family who doesn't see any of my small achievements but to me it's big.

AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS!!!!!!

A Chicago hospital that tested antibodies found 30 percent of those tested had antibodies.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu.

some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

"I absolutely hate being a high-functioning person with generalized & social anxiety disorder. I go through my day and no one knows how much effort it takes me to fake socializing, to fake talking to people, most people just assume I'm a bitch at first until they get to know me because I don't speak up very much but when I do, I sound confident.. but only because I FORCE myself to. 

I get most things done on my checklist. I workout, I eat healthy, I have a degree, I'm in a relationship, I pay my bills, I seem like I have my shit together. But I don't. I spend most of my time over-analzying things I've said, walking around faking everything all day, worried I can't trust anyone around me and over-analzying my relationship, calling myself a loser, telling myself I'm not good enough, having PTSD flashbacks from an abusive childhood. And it's wild that no one has any idea. And I'll never let them know. Because I'm embarrassed.

So if you see someone who seems like they have their shit together or you're jealous, or you think they just don't talk to you a lot because they don't like you.. maybe consider that they are high-functioning. I think we tend to forget that depression & anxiety don't only present as not being able to get out of bed or do anything.",anxiety

"I had a panic attack while driving, pulled over off the road to stay safe, and someone hit me at full speed while texting and driving. My car was totaled. I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).

For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. 

I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. 

I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. 

The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like ""WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?"" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.

My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?",anxiety
"Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle. I have really bad IBS with panic-/anxiety disorder and those two combined make it extremely difficult to travel. I don't have a car so I have to use the public transport.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is "" stop using meds "". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds. Also according to her, stomach problems and panic disorder are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with eachother... sigh.",anxiety

"How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself So if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, I’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I’ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don’t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:

At this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you’ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” It’s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being “engaged.” This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it’s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn’t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. It’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. If you’re lying down, lay on your back. If you’re sitting, sit up straight.

Once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here’s what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It’s long, so I don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as “an incurable disease” in this book. He’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I’d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you’re down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but I’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won’t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I’ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. I didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you’re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You’ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here’s what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. And it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I’d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. If you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “I’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t I seeing my anxiety improve?” And the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. 

**5.** Give it time. I’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, I’ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I’m a loser.” In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You’re in the home stretch. This is it. You’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.

There really isn’t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.

Then finally…

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That’s it. All the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. It’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don’t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. If it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. If it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don’t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you’ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. You’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there’s anything you want me to expand upon.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

Edit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list. Thanks u/PM10inPAYPAL4LULZ. Also fixed some formatting issues.

Edit 4: Thanks again for all the support everyone. I'm glad people are still managing to find this post even though it was written almost a half year ago. I tossed a book recommended by u/andrelolzi up on the list in case anyone is looking for more resources.",anxiety

"The best gift I could have gotten on Christmas My teenage son has OCD and for the last year+ his brain has been telling him that I am “infected” so he often won’t stay in the same room as me, sometimes won’t talk to me, races away from me and won’t touch things that I’ve touched.

It’s incredibly challenging and hurts my heart.

For Christmas, he said I get a hug. I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head.

It filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later.

I truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten.

Also, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I’m divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman. (I invited their father over last year to help them with the transition, but not this year). My son wanted to be sure I had something in my stocking since my ex always did that for me.

I feel so loved by my thoughtful sons.",anxiety

"I think I prefer depression over anxiety After a very anxious week I feel burnt out. Now I feel just depressed, the kind of depressive state that is tolerable. 

I feel no sadness and anger, I am just tired and indifferent. My brain is so tired that I have no energy to be anxious. That kinda feels good. Without paralyzing terror I can do small things, not overly passionate, but just good enough. 

My baseline is so low, that I feel happy being just depressed.
_____
Edit: I think it needs to be here, ‘Objectively, depression and anxiety both suck, sometimes **the change** from months long depression to anxiety, and vice versa, **feels better**. Then you realize it is not energy or motivation but anxiety, it is not calmness it is numbness from depression. I really hope you will get better and find help, because those changes between those two are sometimes very misleading, and can be a false promise. Do not postpone the therapy or whatever you were meaning to do or start. And change that baseline of feeling good to a higher norm’.",anxiety

"I never realized how physically sick anxiety can make you... Does anyone else sometimes feel like they have the flu or something during high-stress times? I’ve been managing my anxiety pretty well the past few months but the last week or so I’ve been feeling like I caught a bug and am constantly tired, my chest hurts, I am incredibly moody and have a short temper, have an upset stomach, etc. I called into work sick a day too because I thought I was sick with something and felt so out of it. I attended an event yesterday I’ve been extremely worried about for the past couple weeks and the second I got in the car to leave it’s like my sickness just disappeared completely and I felt on cloud 9. It was bizarre. Could this all have been due just to the anxiety? I’ve never had this happen before but I’ve been home since and feel back to normal again.",anxiety

Climbing the panic attack mountain (art) ,anxiety
"I just realised the reason I panic when I make mistakes is because I was punished for mistakes in my childhood. One of my earliest memories is from when I was about 4 years old. While I was playing in the garden I fell over and injured my hand. My knuckle was bleeding quite a lot and I still have a scar from the injury to this day. Crying, I ran inside to my mother.

After treating my wound, she spanked me as punishment for my mistake.

If my mother had decided to give me comfort and reassurance in these kinds of situations, maybe in my adulthood, when I made a mistake, my natural response would be to try to soothe myself and calm down.

Instead, when I make a mistake, my natural response is to feel anxiety or panic, and it's really difficult for me to calm down.

I'm hoping that this realisation will be the first step towards me being able to overwrite my childhood conditioning and learn how to treat myself with acceptance and understanding.",anxiety

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
>""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""

"The whole world seems excited for lockdown to end, but no one seems to be talking about those of us who are feeling anxious about normal life returning. Surely I am not on my own?

"My therapist gave me some information that was a game changer. It was another day at therapy. Going thru the motions and questions, feeling like I was making now progress and pretty much wasting my time down a dead end road. I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it’s just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who’s thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don’t put myself in those situations, I don’t have to worry about all those things. 

She says, that’s good! You’re beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It’s built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You’ve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it’s the process of growth. It’s like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It’s completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you’ll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. 

It took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I’m glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it’s been a game changer. Hope this helps someone else!",anxiety
"Please start exercising I’ve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I’ve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I’ll skip lifting certain days if I’m too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I’m a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven’t had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don’t notice them. I’ve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I’m starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I’m planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven’t been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don’t overwhelm yourself. You’ll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. 

Best of luck to all of you!

Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I’m sorry to anyone who said they’re unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you’re having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. 

I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it’s subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself. It’s not perfect but it’s just enough freedom to allow myself to improve my stamina and strength.",anxiety
"I Had a Panic Attack at Work, and My Boss Surprised Me Hi everyone,

I wanted to share something that happened yesterday. I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but I've always managed to keep it under wraps at work. Yesterday, during a team meeting, I felt it building up the rapid heartbeat, the dizziness, the overwhelming urge to flee.

Before I knew it, I was hyperventilating in front of everyone. I was mortified. I thought, ""Great, now everyone knows I'm a mess.""

But then something unexpected happened. My boss calmly ended the meeting and sat down next to me. She didn't bombard me with questions or make a scene. She just said, ""It's okay. Let's take a walk.""

We went outside, and she shared that her sister also struggles with anxiety. She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health.

I always thought showing vulnerability at work was a weakness, but her kindness showed me otherwise. If you're struggling, please know that there are people who will understand.

"The side of anxiety most people don’t understand. Started a new job about a month ago, finally received my embroidered shirts that I’m required to wear. Go to put one on and it doesn’t fit, none of them do. Now I’m having to wear the plain t-shirt into work until they can order me more. I woke up 2 1/2 hours early to make sure I was ready. Now I’m sitting in a parking lot nearby being so nervous to have to tell my boss they don’t fit. Anxiety is having to go through every scenario possible that can happen when I go back in. My body hurts physically and I feel nauseous over this. All over a simple fix that will take him 5 seconds to handle in reality, but my brain doesn’t work that way. This sucks ☹️",anxiety

"I impulsively asked a girl out yesterday IN PERSON. She told me she had a boyfriend but I'm honestly just proud of myself for even doing it. SHe's this girl who works at a local tobacco shop. I kind of knew she probably had a boyfriend and I'd get shut down. She was super polite and it was all good. I imagine it will be ( a little bit ) easier next time I want to do this. I was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually. Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.

Edit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.

I take care of myself as much as I can, I put effort in my makeup hair and clothing.

"Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling? Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don’t know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I’m currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I’d say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‘good’ kid so never got into trouble much. That’s also why I can’t recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn’t okay so I don’t think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn’t even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student’s name while I’m doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn’t even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn’t wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‘troublemaker’ I guess. They’re the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents’ nerves. They don’t listen, aren’t okay with being told “no” and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I’ve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I’d be in the same room, other times I’d be in my room and they’d be downstairs. During these times I’ll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I’m in the same room I won’t even say a word and just get up and leave because it’s too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don’t understand why this happens to me 

Thank you in advance for the help :)",anxiety

"Most people are accepting of you having an anxiety disorder, but an unfortunate amount of people expect you to only have symptoms in private.

This is something that needs changing. It is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when their their blood sugar gets too low and it affects their work. Even if the circumstances of the blip in their health was due to poor diet or a rough week (I had a co-worker that had this happen at work) but when I struggled with low mood I was told ‘we all have days like that’ ... ‘don’t let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable’ 

This is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I’m lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me.

I just really loved that drive. 

When explaining the drive to a girl I was really into at the time, she was talking about how it’s impossible to remember that drive and every turn because there are many. I have driven on those roads enough to remember exactly when to take each turn, I proceeded to go over every turn. about halfway through is when i began to overthink everything.

"after almost canceling an interview today due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!!! I was SO nervous all last night and all day today about this interview. Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I’m really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I’d have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn’t really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn’t. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn’t stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he’s Never been impressed by anyone’s German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don’t, I’m just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.

"Does anyone else feel anger toward their parents for “causing” their anxiety disorder?

This has made me anxious, insecure, and have a low self esteem. I can usually circle back most of my anxiety back to how she has treated me over the years. Some of it came from bullying too of course.

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine! And I think I'll be able to handle it again when I get my 2nd dose!",anxiety

Life must be so easy and relaxing... to just live - not constantly battling your mind, not constantly overthinking, not constantly catastrophizing, not constantly evading intrusive thoughts, not constantly having to tell yourself to stop thinking of bad things or the worst unlikely possibilities or past trauma.

"UPDATE: Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle. As the original post got quite a lot of attraction I'll post an update.

Original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today\_i\_had\_a\_job\_interview\_and\_i\_managed\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today_i_had_a_job_interview_and_i_managed_to_go/) 

&#x200B;

Yesterday evening I got a call that they wanted me there today. I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to ""guarantee"" success. 

Even with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination.

I got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed.

I called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about "" having some upper respetory symptoms "" or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it.

Even tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that.

I haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great.

This was a major, major setback, but as my dad says "" You do everything you can, and that's all you can do "". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war. 

And what gives a little extra twist to this: Traveling by car is fine. No problem whatsoever. But if I can't get to work, I can't afford a car. And if I can't take the bus, I can't get to work. Fml.",anxiety

- Watching / having something on something in the background until you fall asleep
- Alternatively, limiting screen time (phone or television) before bed 
- Diffusing essential oils / spraying pillow before bed
- YouTube videos of distant sounds or ambient sounds
- ASMR videos
- Taking melatonin or Calm (Magnesium Citrate) before bed
- Yoga and meditation in combination or separately 
- Self-care routine before bed 
- Dedicating “worry time” and trying to talk yourself out of the anxious thought spiral early on
- Trying to dedicate your bed for sleep, rather than hanging out there when you aren’t sleepy 
- Taking CBD before bed
- Limiting caffeine and alcohol

"I don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given! It's great to feel not as alone in this discomfort, and I think I have some ideas and goals on how to improve my situation in this new year. Thank you all so much.",anxiety

"hidden ways you’re keeping your body in fight or flight mode 1. tongue cemented to the roof of your mouth? not only are you tensing your jaw, you’re constricting the muscles in your throat. this can make it feel like it’s closing, and can make you swallow more air which in turn can make your stomach hurt. let your tongue rest.

2. head feel heavy as hell? kinda dizzy and wobbly? like a band wrapped around your head?
tension headaches. your neck doesn’t wanna hold up your head anymore. before freaking yourself out. focus on your neck and shoulder muscles, are they sore as hell? move your neck around. drop your shoulders. massage them. watch how fast your head clears up.

3. feel gassy? like you need to burp or fart or something? you just might. get on your knees, put your ass in the air and relax that butt. drink club soda. do yoga. being too gassy can keep an anxious person in fight or flight. 

4. speaking of butts, are you clenching your butthole really tight for no reason? mhm. your body thinks it’s in danger. relax that thing.

5. let your damn tummy hang out. no one cares. give your guts some room to breathe. then breathe WITH that tummy, not your chest.

"My best friend became a mass murderer. I’ve never been the same since that day. So, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. It’s been several years, about 6, and while I’ll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away.   

First off for context, I’m just gonna show who the serial killer was. It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  

[Mr. Anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       

Anyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn’t help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments.   

A little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I’m pretty sure he either didn’t want to subject me to that or something.   

When I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn’t even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. 

When he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn’t do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn’t realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  

The thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he’d try to change the subject. Don’t get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   

When the murders happened, I didn’t even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn’t feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like “oh let’s smoke a bowl that’ll cheer you up!” And that was when I had my first panic attack. I’m talking full on “I’m gonna die oh my god.” This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn’t sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn’t know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   

I’ve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it’s caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can’t really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don’t really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he’s never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  

Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I’m kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It’s hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can’t focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I’d love to answer, but I’d also love some advice and support. 

Thanks for reading.   

Edit; 

Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I’m in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don’t deserve that compassion.  
Yes I know that’s stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a “haha I got you” thing that he loved doing.   

Anyways, I’m trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven’t responded yet, I will definitely try. I’ll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously. ",anxiety

"I wish people would understand that anxiety isn’t always full blown panic attacks It’s not just getting really breathless and panicky for a short period of time, or being scared to go into social situations. It’s feeling breathless for days, it’s headaches, dizziness, poor memory, no appetite, it’s all these physical symptoms that just add to this feeling hovering over you that there’s something wrong all the time like a cloud. i’m sorry for ranting but i just needed to get this out",anxiety
"One of the most annoying things about panic attacks: No matter how many times you've had identical symptoms and came out fine, they're still just as terrifying.

But its still terrifying every time. I hate panic attacks.",anxiety

"I WENT TO A PARK BY MYSELF I’m a 26 y/o and for the first time since high school I was able to go for a walk at a public park by myself! 

Last December I tried to take my life because of my social anxiety and depression. 10 months later I was able to conquer my fears! 

I took advice from a friend as my anxiety was starting to feel uncontrollable. I started to drive to the park every morning, but couldn't get out of the car. I continued driving there every morning to attempt to make myself more comfortable with my surroundings. The morning I got out of the car I was feeling scared stepping out of the car, but as I started walking a sense of pride came over myself. I was so happy I made it this far that I continued to walk and walk and walk and got to experience a joy in myself that was long overdue!

I started to get into a routine, journaling (writing three things I love about myself, + and - things that happened throughout the day, three short term goals I want to accomplish), walking, meditating, etc. I’m just so darn proud of myself! 

One baby step at a time!

However, my anxiety makes it SO hard to do that sometimes, and the guilt of doing ‘relaxing’ things when I should be doing other things, and my lack of ability to concentrate, my angry thoughts, all tend to sweep up that day full of potential and curb stomp it on the ground.

"Medication has made me realized how much anxiety I actually had compared to how much I thought I had I've had anxiety all my life and this year, especially after all the covid lockdowns, I noticed my anxiety and depression was significantly worse than usual. So I went on medication this time.

The first week was terrible but as it's settling in, my anxiety is disappearing. I had no idea that my anxiety was as bad as it was until it disappeared. Before the medication, if I had a problem at work or with another person, I would dwell on it for hours or sometimes days. I presumed I was just a sensitive person but I've realised it was the anxiety.

I thought my anxiety were just the attacks I had or when it was really bad that I couldn't leave the house, I did not realize I had it every single day. I must have just got so used to having anxiety all my life that it seemed normal to me.

"Anyone else have ""functioning"" panic attacks where you feel awful, but can otherwise appear totally fine to others? Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.

"This time last year I couldn’t leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today I talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure. I’m a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn’t drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn’t leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it’s just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn’t the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who’s notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can’t touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I’m still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. 

I hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and I failed at times but didn’t stop trying.

"Does anyone ever feel like they are extremely lonely but are also the one isolating yourself? (Ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?) Hi. I’ve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn’t spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn’t until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they’re retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn’t relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had “other groups” of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they’d be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I’m an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I’ll be home for 3-4 days straight, can’t bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple “socialization for the day.” I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can’t bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don’t understand what’s going on with me, it’s like I’ve reached such a level of being a slob that I can’t bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won’t get back (though let’s be real, I won’t be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I wanted to talk about breathing.  

A very common technique for coping with anxiety is to breathe deeply - you’ve probably heard this or seen it in an infographic.  This is indeed a helpful technique, but unfortunately I don’t think it is explained well and I have often seen users say that it can make their anxiety worse.  This comes as no surprise when in response to anxiety or a panic attack all you hear is “take a breath!”  Great, I’ll do that, thanks.  I’m going to break down the proper technique piece by piece in the hope that it helps someone out.  

When you are anxious many people feel like they are hyperventilating and the answer to that is because you tense up and your breathing becomes shallow and “high up” (your breaths are filling your upper lungs) which makes the anxiety worse.  You are, in fact, hyperventilating, but you can fix this.  You are in control of your breath as much as it may not feel like it in a moment of panic.  

What you want to do is called [diaphragmatic breathing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragmatic_breathing) (or belly breaths if you’re a normal person and not in a medical profession).   To demonstrate this, sit up in a comfortable position and place a hand gently beneath your ribs and on your upper belly - concentrate on expanding this area with each inhale.  This is the breathing you are aiming for.  

What we will be doing is commonly called “[box breathing](https://imgur.com/0N53Gah)”.  

Taking belly breaths:

1. Slowly inhale on a count to four (I find through the nose most effective but breathing through the mouth will do you no harm - just keep it slow). 
1. Hold the breath for a count to 4
1. Exhale for a count to 4
1. Hold the empty lungs for a count to 4.  

Repeat until your anxiety eases or your breathing resumes a normal rhythm.  

That’s it!  I hope this explanation helps out someone, I know it certainly helped me.  Practice it when you’re calm and the next time the anxiety ramps up, give it a try.  I’ve also used this technique to steady myself for taking low-light photos and building card towers.  Bonus.  

Love, 

Remy",anxiety

"Having a long term anxiety disorder is being happy and confident for more than 2 days and then considering if it’s mania because it’s so unusual. Honestly this happened to me, if you read my posts you’ll know I’m mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything (6 months without a major panic attack woohoo!) I’ve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. 

But I’ve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I’m not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha. 

It goes to show I’m not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‘meh’ mood. 

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it’s actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I’m not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I’ve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I’m allowed to be happy. I’m allowed to be angry... and anxiety is ok in small doses too. ",anxiety

I am at the point where I know I am overthinking and entertaining unrealistic ideas but once it’s in my mind I can not get it out.

It can be something so small and I can’t focus on anything else but that one thing or something multiple things. I have tried to explain this feeling to people close in my life, I try to explain it as having multiple tabs open on your browser and you are running through the tabs clicking and opening every tab as if you are rushing a last minute research assignment jumping from tab from tab. Whenever i explain my over thinking they tell me “you’re just making yourself over think, you’re doing this to your self just stop overthinking” which makes no sense to me!! How can I just stop thinking?? i would love to but my brain is just always running. This happens even when I am trying to go to sleep which makes sleeping soo hard i have gone to the doctor for insomnia and depression but I have never thought these are the results and side effects of having tons of anxiety.

I followed the advice y'all gave me after my last interview and had a ""fake it till you make it"" approach to all interactions with this employer.  I made dog puns in my first e-mail, joked a bit on the phone, and made the whole process fun for myself (which, it turns out, made it fun for everyone else too!).

"Stop the benzo fearmongering please Yes, benzos can be addictive.

Yes, benzos can absolutely ruin your life if you abuse them.

Yes, benzos can have side effects.

But there are millions of people who responsibly use benzos to treat anxiety, panic attacks, etc and significantly benefit from them (myself included) I’ve seen a lot of posts here about people claiming to have taken one benzo and having a massive reaction from them or some equally crazy story about someone taking like 5mg every time. All it does is promote fear and scare people who could benefit from them.

I’m not a proponent of putting anyone on benzos unless they are extremely disciplined about it and don’t have any addictive tendencies and am aware of the dangers but please stop the fear mongering.

Edit: I want to amend this post by saying, if your doctor prescribed you for daily use, I am so sorry. I think doctors who prescribe for daily use are irresponsible.

"Remember the 25% rule for social anxiety. 25% of people will like you and nothing you can do will make them not like you.

25% of people won’t like you and nothing you can do will make them like you.

25% of people will like you but something you do could make them not like you.

25% of people won’t like you but something you do could make them like you.

You can’t really tell who is who in most cases and you have no control over who they are and how they react to you.

So it doesn’t make sense to try and figure it out or try to control it, just let it go. Someone’s reaction or perception of you is not your fault, just do your best and don’t let yourself get caught up using your imagination to guess what people are thinking about you.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don’t waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can’t be trusted anyways.

You don’t need to respond to anything immediately, you don’t need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn’t think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn’t matter and it’s OK for people to be wrong!

"My therapist recently taught me a trick that has been actually changing my life It's pretty simple and may seem obvious, but just make up your mind. That's it. Think about a thing, take in all the factors/risks, then *decide* what you're going to do. 

Don't question it after that. You already know you spent the time ruminating over it, you already took in every detail, now stop the cycle of over/repetitive thinking and decide. I know it's easier said than done, but with some practice this can be so helpful. 

Most fear/anxiety comes from the unknown, yeah? I think many people agree about that. We can never be sure what will happen in a future situation, so we tend to spin it *over* and *over* and *over* for no reason. Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it.

"Anyone else panic when someone near them is angry or possibly angry? I notice that when someone in the same space as me is angry or shows signs of anger, I become extremely on edge. I start to shake, I get the urge to cry or run/hide and I go completely mute, unable to look that person in the eye or talk to them, kind of in fear of getting in their way and having them take it out on me (though not always). Something as small as that person sighing really loudly, or someone slamming or dropping something sends me into a panic. It takes me a really long time to calm down too. I assume this is from my social anxiety? But I haven’t heard of this in anyone else with social anxiety. I keep googling it but each time I end up with nothing, so I decided to ask/post here. Is this an anxiety disorder thing? Do other people experience this? Or am I just weird? :/

Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!",anxiety
"Anyone else wake up hours early for things only to lay awake doing absolutely nothing for as long as possible? I can’t believe I never put 2 and 2 together and thought of this as a way that my anxiety manifests. For as long as I can remember I have done this, I like to wake up super early for things and just lay there doing nothing because I feel like sleeping all the way until the stressful event is too fast and if I just lay there awake I can savor every second that I have of not doing the thing. 

I used to do this every morning before work when I had a job I didn’t like. I did it all the time for school especially in middle school. I just did it for my first day of classes this semester and I’m a senior in college. Woke up at like 3:30 for no reason and never even tried to go back to sleep. Just laid there under my blanket trying to keep my mind as blank as possible and enjoy the nothingness before my day.

"I am so proud of myself and I need to tell someone Two years ago I was too scared to leave my house. 

Today I decided to visit my dad an apply for an internship abroad. 

To visit my dad I have to travel by train for eight hours. Two years ago I couldn't get on the bus to go to college.

The internship will be ten weeks long. Two years ago I had panic attacks about going into the garden. 

I feel so extremely proud of myself, even if my family and friends don't understand. I'm starting to be myself again, even though I was never adventurous. 

I finally feel okay doing things on my own.


Edit: First off all I want to thank all of you for the kind words and awards. I woke up this morning and was greated with so many kind and lovely responses. 

I've seen quite a lot of people asking about how I got here. The thing is, I don't have a simple answer (although I guess the answer to anxiety is never simple).

If it wasn't for my lovely SO I wouldn't have gotten this far. At one point he said: I want to go on holiday. We don't have to be gone for long, we don't have to go far away. You can choose the location and if you just want to hang around the hotelroom every day that's fine. But I need a break from daily life. 

I spent most of the holiday in the hotel but I did go for a few walks. Having a panic attack in a different country feels different; the people who see you will never see you again, so it took away some of the shame aspect for me. 

After that summer college started again. I hadn't gone much the year before but I talked to my teachers and they allowed me to repeat the year. I didn't dare to take the bus (my anxiety is centered around being locked up) so I cycled to college every day for a while. 

When the weather got colder I realized I didn't want to cycle 13 kilometres through the snow so I tried going by bus. Not going anywhere, just getting in and seeing how many stops I could survive.

So, I kind of did exposure therapy on myself. I eventually got through the waiting list of a psychologist but by then I could go out by myself. After she went away for pregnancy leave I just pushed myself further and further. 

SO and I moved house in April to a cheap but lovely appartment in a lovely neighbourhood in a small village. I finally feel a bit at peace and I think that caused my sudden progress. 

This probably won't really help anyone as seeing a  professional probably is better than doing it all by yourself. I am just lucky enough to have my SO for support, even if he will never understand how important he was in this process.",anxiety

First time I've been able to sit in a place and not feel like I'm at a high anxiety level in over a year. I'm quietly proud of myself, so I just wanted to share 😊

I know some might think that's not a big step, and it's not but that's okay. Small steps are just as important, because I'm still going forward 💜",anxiety
"I just got fired on my first day and I don't know what to do I have an anxiety disorder and often get panic attacks. I just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave. So yea, I don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. I'm lost, I can't even have a normal job for a day. 

I hope this is readable as english isn't my first language and I'm still pretty nervous about everything.

"Does anyone else occasionally have ""Time anxiety""? Time anxiety as in having anxiety that you won't ever have enough time to do something specific. In my case, I always get anxious when my wife has me run to the store or go to an appointment mainly because I fear I won't have enough time to do things that I wanna do even going as far as to get annoyed in my head when I'm told to let the dog out after work...

&#x200B;

I am happy to have plenty of free time once I'm off from work, about 6 hours till I go to sleep so 5-6 hours of me doing what I want but when something simple like letting the dog out, shaving, cleaning a bathroom comes up I get anxiety thinking oh crap I'm, not gonna have enough time to do what I wanna do....how can you get past this? It's obviously silly to me because doing all that takes very little time and when i do have free time I spend it watching tv and hardly doing anything productive...

"I was the only student to join the video chat this morning. Since we transitioned to online classes, my Spanish professor still wanted to meet with us so we could continue to practice speaking Spanish. When we first started doing this, I wondered what would happen if only one person showed up, and now I know. 

This morning, I was the only student that joined the call for the majority of the session. Another student joined about 10 minutes before the call was supposed to end. It didn't make me panic as much as I thought it would, but I did kinda panic a little bit whenever it took me too long to answer some of the activities.

I did get the chance to have a little bit of a one on one lesson to practice using words in the past tense. We have an Oral Interview coming up soon and I needed the practice because I will have to talk in the past tense. 

It also made me feel a little better about making mistakes (learning a second language is very hard). My professor was very patient when I took a little bit longer to answer some of the questions and was helpful when I couldn't remember some words.

"I've learned that one of the best ways to overcome anxiety is to listen and take care of your body. It is the only boss. I'm 25F and I have anxiety. Obsessive and intrusive thoughts. Panic. Paranoia. Constant worry. Incapacity of joy and calmness. All this in a loop. All of this makes me forget about my body. So it accumulates a huge amount of stress.

When my body is relaxed, my mind follows it.

I always forget about this. Always. And if I remember I don't do anything about it because I'm too busy worrying about shit.

Take a deep, really deep deep breath. Hold it. Let it go.

Dance.

Take warm or cool baths.

Comb your hair.

Drink lots of water.

Stretch.

Take sunbathes.

Hydrate your skin.

Put your feet on scented water.

Run.

Ride a bicycle.

Cry.

Walk on the rain.

Get a massage.

Feel the wind on your face.

Get a sweet hug from a loved one.

"When you’re so used to feeling anxious that being calm and relaxed feels like a high I’ve been feeling very calm and relaxed recently, and because I was so accustomed to confusion and worry, mainly due to not having a clue how to behave socially and being fearful of having a meltdown whenever I’m at work and people all talk at me at once, being in such a calm state felt like, to me, I was high. As in, stoned or dosed up on benzos. I should mention I didn’t actually take anything. Who else has noticed this?

I have awful anxiety and always plan out my routine with at least an hour gap of having to get somewhere. But when the time comes to actually leave the house, I... can’t?

I lay there like “oh I should leave in 10 minutes but I haven’t even gotten up... what is the point?” and then drag myself out of bed, cursing myself for giving in. 

And then the entire time I’m on my way there, my depression hits and I’m beating myself up because DUH, I’m awfully late and now the other party who told me a time to meet up has to wait for my sad, pathetic self to show up.

I didn’t think this would get as much response as it did. 

I’ve watched my father suffer from severe panic attacks for the last 15 years. He had to retire early and it took years for him to get disability. 

I watched him every morning with crippling anxiety to where he throws up. He doesn’t even have to leave the house, as soon as he wakes up he’s sick. He’s been on Xanax for 10-12 years probably. It’s the only thing that helps him. 

As a child who witnessed what severe anxiety and panic attacks can do to a family, I never want any of my family to experience it or anyone else out there. There were times my family only made $400 a month when my dad used to make $2,000 every 2 weeks.

Edit: Glad to know I'm not alone in this feeling. Also, a bonus for you: I once used my house phone to call my mobile phone to make sure it was working, and even holding the two phones was enough to raise my heart-rate, I have no idea why.",anxiety
"I reported the doctor who implied I was lying about Anxiety. Today after about 4 weeks of sitting on the idea I finally reported the doctor who implied I was lying about Anxiety in an attempt to get out of work while getting paid. 

What that asshole doesn't know is 1.) I was authorized time off for my anxiety and did not need a doctor's note from him. I was genuinely seeking help and 2.) I got a second opinion from someone who took mental health more serious who gave me a doctor's note to stay out of work for 2 weeks and gave me the suggestion to talk to a therapist. 

I return to my new doctor at the end of next week to see if more time is needed or if medication needs to be prescribed for my anxiety and depression. 

Nothing may come of my complaint but, at least I did it!

"It took me years to realize my anxiety was anxiety and not just my personality. I only came to this realization recently and it's weird that it took so long when anxiety runs in my family. My mom's been hospitalized for panic attacks. I've had depressive bouts but every time I heard someone mention anxiety, my brain was like ""hmmm. Not me."" 

&#x200B;

I though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality. I thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. I thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. I thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

&#x200B;

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. I did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe I've been anxious all my life and I Just never realized it because I thought it was normal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't really know what the point of me typing all this out is, but it just feels good to know maybe there's hope for me. I talked to my doctor and was prescribed zoloft last Friday. I don't know how much it will change me, I know that it's not some kind of magic pill, but just knowing that I'm not alone and that there's a chance to overcome this is so comforting to me.

"To anyone else who's having a self sabotage day This goes out to everyone who's spent the day laying in your bed, scrolling theough reddit for the past 8 hours because you can't handle today, or don't have the motivation to get up. To everyone who's had a panic attack or indulged in something you shouldn't have.

 I want to send you a message of support in this sea of frustration, panic, and uncertainty. I wish I knew the exact words to help everyone who's in one of these positions today, to be able to make a positive impact in your life, and give you solace. Unfortunately, I can't, but I want you to know that mistakes and slip ups don't define you. Sometimes anxiety is so powerful it feels the only way to drown it out is to mindlessly scroll on your phone, or to have that beer you said you wouldn't have. Being on this subreddit in the first places means you have made a conscious decision to seek support and self improvement. You can get through these days, and if you feel like you can't, please seek out professional help. You are worth it. 

 I had one of those self sabotage days today. My social anxiety has been crippling, I skipped the gym, smoked those cigs I planed to toss out, and spent today watching youtube videos instead of doing my work. I know that on these days seeing a post like this would help me, and that's why I'm writing this, so people in my situation today can see that they aren't alone this Sunday. 

Cheers to making it though these nasty days, and to here's to knowing we'll get through this.

"I am too sensitive for this world Does anyone else just break down crying whenever they make the smallest mistake? I am so worried about never being good enough that anytime I do something wrong or can’t figure something out, the tears start coming. I feel like I have absolutely no control over my emotions and it’s humiliating me. I started crying in class, in front of my supervisor, and in public, all for reasons that seem so small in retrospect. But when I start crying I get so embarrassed that it makes me cry even more. My dad told me I need to grow a thicker skin and my supervisor told me my body language is always aloof and uncaring when I’m turning away to avoid making eye contact to try and stop the tears. I can’t seem to win. I can’t even check my email anymore because I’m so afraid to see someone saying I’ve done something wrong.

I’m new here and I guess I just hope I’m not the only one that deals with this. I’m diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety.  I’ve been making myself physically sick the past week over going to a bridal shower on the weekend. The reason I have the anxiety is just the fear of being judged by others or saying something stupid.  I’ve even been in group therapy (iOP) for weeks to try and find ways to lessen my anxiety, but I just feel  like I took a step back.

I was officially diagnosed at the age of 15, and whenever I tried to date, I could never go through with it. I would seldom try to talk to girls about dating seriously, and when I did, I usually canceled or just chickened out.

But today I was feeling good, I think I had done pretty well at an Exam I was studying all week for, and it was almost the weekend.  I was in the class we're in and kept sneaking glances at her. The feeling in my gut surged when I thought about asking for her phone number. I keep thinking of reasons why I shouldn't, even though I know I wanted to. I finally just told my self ""Screw it, I'm doing it"" and threw caution to the wind, ignoring the feeling in my gut.

I asked her after class was over, and she had me give her my number and texted me afterwards. Idk if anything will come of it, but this felt like a huge milestone for me!

"PLEASE DONT POST ABOUT YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT!!! My mom posted several times on her Facebook talking about my recent hospital (psych ward) stay. (I’m 19, was 18 at the time, like it matters anyway, you shouldn’t post anyone’s personal info on social media whether they are your kid as a minor or not) Luckily she didn’t mention the psych ward part but I asked her to take it down because it’s private and no ones business but my own and my doctors but she didn’t so I had to resort to publicly commenting;

“Mom, please take this down. As I said in person I would really prefer it and strongly ask that you dont talk about my mental health or my issues on your Facebook with people whom I don’t know. I love you, and no offense to anyone who’s read this post, but this information is private about me and I do not like that it has been shared without my consent. I understand your concerned for me, but this is no ones business but my own and my doctors. Thank you all for the well wishes, and have a blessed day.” 

Hopefully the embarrassment will get her to take it the fuck down. And before you ridicule me I did what I thought necessary. She needs to learn her place. She can’t go spouting my shit to everyone she meets. I won’t tolerate that shit. I’m not a minor any more, I’m a grown ass adult, and if I didn’t live in her house still she wouldn’t know a damn thing about me anymore. This shit is why I have trust issues.

"Anyone else get the urge to just leave everything behind and go live in a log cabin in the mountains? Lately ive become more and more unsure what i want from my life, and everytime I feel sad, mad or deprived of energy i just wanna pack my shit and go, its mostly a coping mechanism i think, but its also way more.

The past years ive seen problems come at me from so far away but i never seem to have the energy to move out of the way of the problem coming at me.

"Things that helped me manage my anxiety, maybe this can help you too I am taking Lexapro and doing therapy, but I also made a lot of lifestyle changes have made a huge difference, so I wanted to share my list. 

1. I went completely caffeine free. It's been about a month. I also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. 

2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole ""comparison"" crap and drama, don't need it.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

That's the way life is for everyone. But everything will work itself out in the end. You will find a job, you will get that degree, you will find love, you will be successful, the terrible thing you are worried about will probably not happen, and even if something unexpected does occur you are 100% strong enough to get through it.

"A stranger destroyed all my confidence. I was standing in line for food and this woman her mother and her boyfriend came up behind me and asked if i was in line, i said a simple ""oh, yeah"" pointed at the line, went back to fiddling on my phone to ease my anxiety. And thus began the fifteen minute barrage of degrading comments. She made fun of my voice, the way i stood, i leaned against a wall and she made fun of it. I tried texting someone about the pinch i was in and she made fun of me for texting so much. By the time i finally got to order i could hardly speak because i was on the verge of throwing up. The whole time she made fun of me i was just hanging my head pretending not to hear...im never going back there again even though it was my favorite place to eat. When i leave the house now i feel so small and worthless. Everything she said was all the ""silly"" things my anxiety constantly nagged me about that I constantly assured myself nobody cared about. That stranger destroyed my confidence, i have no desire to go anywhere",anxiety
"I no longer have suicidal thoughts Well actually I haven’t had it for maybe weeks now, not since January or early February. In my head, what started off as a thoughts of how to kill myself if I reach my suicidal phase turns into a “I want to die.” But I realize that I can’t kill myself, because I can’t do it, it’s not in me, it’s in my head but it doesn’t tell me to do it. I never attempted it and can’t even cut my arm. So I stop having it because it’s not gonna happen.

For a while, I think the reasoning behind this is because I’m a coward, I couldn’t end the pain of living so I have to live like you’re half alive and half dead at the same time. Recently, I talk about this to a lad I know, and he said that wasn’t cowardice, that was bravery. 

Because despite all the shit that happens to me and around me and in the world, I still choose to live. Despite growing up in a dysfunctional family, despite not studying that much in school and potentially not getting into college, despite the world being a shitty place where the rich gets richer where the rest burns in hell. Despite all of that odds, I’m still here. Not living fully, but still breathing, that’s a plus for me I guess, I am crawling but I am moving slowly. I went to sleep that night and give myself a smile in the dark because why not? It’s a command given by a brain, but a smile. Maybe I’ll read a book, idk.",anxiety
"Currently at the movies alone for the first time in my life. I’m kind of freaking out with my hands shaking but I’m also a bit proud I’m doing it - going to the movies alone has been something I’d always wanted to do but been too anxious and self-conscious to do Okay so it’s in a city 2.5 hours away from where I live so it’s a bit of cheating, as what’s put me off doing it before is seeing someone I know lol, and I am doing it to distract myself from not eating today...but I’m still doing it! I’m still super self-conscious about it but I’m not bailing..yet anyway.

I’m pathetic I know lol, but there’s not many other places I can post about it, so here I am haha

Edit: Thanks for all the kind comments! I really enjoyed the movie and I’m glad I went! :)",anxiety
"Shoulders tense? Jaw clenched? Chest tight? You deserve better. Take a deep breath, let it go, and feel those shoulders droop, jaw muscles unclench, and chest open. Take a breath slowly, fully (belly-chest-head), and as comfortably as possible, and let it out the same way. Repeat this for a minute or as long as you need, and you will feel better. Try to smile if you can because it does help a bit. If it's still tight, it helps to hold the tension (safely) on purpose, and then let the tension go as you exhale. For your chest try breathing in fully (belly-chest-head), holding it, and ""squeezing"" the air to your head. After a bit (10 seconds or so) let it go and feel the tension dissipate. You guys deserve this for toughing it out in this crazy time of our lives. You will get through, and here's a ritual to help you out. Whenever you want to dial it back a bit, go through these motions. Here's a virtual hug you guys.",anxiety
"I finished a whole grilled cheese! Lately my anxiety has been making it hard to eat full meals/meals at all. I’ve been barely choking down 4 bites of food at meal times and trying to supplement with nutrition drinks, all while feeling sick and nauseous almost all the time, and waking up starving in the mornings while still unable to eat much of anything. Even my favorite foods would sound good in concept, but be nauseating once set in front of me. Plus I was wasting so much food just trying to eat anything, and I hate things going to waste.

But today my dad made me a grilled cheese for dinner and I ATE THE WHOLE THING! I could feel that terrible stomach feeling trying to overcome me every time I let my thoughts wander, but when that happened I would slow down and take deep breaths and remind myself that everything is ok, then try to distract myself in the dinner table conversation.

Anyways, it’s not much, but it’s the first full meal I’ve been able to finish in weeks and I’m so happy I wanted to share.",anxiety

"people really underestimate just how dehabilitating anxiety is a while ago, i saw a post about a guy who was afraid to go into costco, and was asking all of these questions that would come across as obvious. the comments were all vicious and mean, they were all mocking him. i couldn't help but feel bad, not only for the guy, but for myself as well, because i found what he posted very relatable. i'm who struggles to do things alone, it made me sad to know that people view me this way.


i thought, if he was suffering from something ""serious"" like depression, i'm sure the commenters would not post the things they did. but since it's ""just"" anxiety, it's fine to make fun of them. it's hard having severe anxiety and having people mocking you on top of it. just makes me sad.",anxiety

Spent the next half hour cleaning myself, but at least most people will never top this.✌🏼✌🏼

"It’s exhausting to be an empathetic person with anxiety As someone with pretty bad anxiety who also likes to keep up to date with the news and learn more about things to stay informed and try to be an ally, I find myself emotionally drained because this year is just so much.

Because then I get anxiety about having the privilege to have the ability to just not pay attention to certain social justice issues.

"Does anyone have a ""hangover"" period following a high-anxiety/stressful event? Such as attending a concert, speaking in front of an audience, or anything that makes you nervous?

I used to be fine going to shows, concerts, anything. I liked it.  
But ever since my first ever panic attack I've been physically ""shaky"", even sometimes when I am not even mentally worried at the time.  
It's like my body turned into a chicken.

Now when I attend an event, I sometimes feel stress symptoms.  
Then after the high excitement/stress event, I sometimes get a ""hangover"" period. I feel so exhausted and sometimes hungry.  


This is when the heart palpitations sometimes kick in. I feel my wrist and it's sometimes about every 5th beat, and sometimes about every 20th beat. These heart palpitations give my chest a weird, uneasy feeling. There's this vague but strong discomfort in chest area, to the point where the thought of going to the ER crosses the mind.

Then I go to bed, get lots of sleep, and wake up still tired when slight anxiety-like tremors the next day. But then as that day progresses, it starts to feel a little better.

Does anyone's body feel ""shaken"" after high excitement/stress events where it takes a while to recover?",anxiety
"Has anyone else’s anxiety been kicking their fucking ass lately like what’s in the air???? Like literally I want to puke. Everyday. Why. So much healing. I can’t even go out literally. I just want to stay in my house. Sit in my room. Cook food. Maybe go outside IF it’s sunny.

Edit: also, does anyone eat their anxiety?? Is that a thing?

Edit #2: do you guys in the replies think maybe you’re being is sensitive than others? I consider myself a clairsentient empath, which is a nice gift and I’m grateful, but it also means that I am highly sensitive to other people’s energy. So my social anxiety is the one I struggle with most. I can feel. Every. Fucking. Thing. No joke. I can feel if someone looks at me, and throws a judgement my way.

"Anxiety is trying to stop me from going to a car wash so I’m going to the car wash in an act of sheer disrespect towards anxiety As the title says, I’ve got “a case of the spooks” where I feel woozy and dizzy and icky about just going to a car wash. As a kid I used to love going,  but now I find the chemically smell kind of difficult to manage. But the car is dirty and I want to do this. 

So now that anxiety has gotten involved, I want to be rude to it. So I’m gonna go get this car clean!

"Reminder: Anxiety is suffering a simulation The suffering is real but you're suffering a simulation. It's not real. 

It's imaginary. 

It's all lies.

A part of your own mind made it up so it can't be an actual danger.

Actual dangers come from outside you.

Fear is meant to protect you from danger. 

But when fear overworks and causes life to become a living hell, it loses its whole point of existence.

Fear isn't meant to make you suffer endlessly, it is only meant to spur you to act in defense for a short while. If you keep looping in a fear cycle, fear has defeated its own purpose and should stop functioning.

There is a reasonable amount of light fear called Eustress that is justified and keeps you on your toes in a hostile environment. Anything more than that fear, anything that paralyses you, that hinders your full functioning, that prevents you from thinking straight, that prevents you from working according to a plan, is excess fear, and by definition has defeated its own purpose. Such fear has no point existing.

The higher number of times you affirm ""I'm actually safe except for XYZ"" the the faster you will feel better.

Remember, unless you're actually in an active war zone or shooting, you;re quite safe. Say it to yourself - ""I'm actually quite safe except for XYZ"".

Finally, remember: Hot flashes, crawling ants, crampy, pain, tingling, needles and other sensations, are _discomfort_, not danger. 

Discomfort is uncomfortable, but safe.

"You aren’t dying. You aren’t dying. You don’t have a rare disease or cancer. No tumors or some weird flesh eating virus that hasn’t been seen in decades. You aren’t going insane. You don’t have MS, or any other genetic disorder. You have anxiety. May I suggest a list of good vibes for this spooky season?? 

1) love yourself. Actually mean it though. Look in the mirror and instead of analyzing your body over anything that appears to be different tell yourself how amazing you are. 

2) drink water, I mean lots of water, drink some liquid IV also. Comes in many flavors and it’s a lot healthier than other drinks. Try to lay off the sodas (however treat yourself every now and then)

3) sleep. I mean sleep like you never slept before. Go to bed earlier, turn your phone on airplane mode and just let the cold room engulf you as if you are in the Arctic (that’s how cold I love it) 

4) eat healthier. Try not to eat chips, junk food. Baked chicken and veggies are great always. (Again treat yourself every once in awhile) 

5) breathing exercises. This is a great way to relieve stress and anxiety. Did you know breathing can help with a lot of medical problems? I suggest you read a book called “Breath” by James Nestor. It’s an extraordinary piece of work.

Remember to love yourself and remember that I love you.",anxiety
"Really missing the pre-COVID world when my severe anxiety was just cuz of regular trauma lmao Hi beautiful people ❤️ Just wanted to vent here over the same feelings everyone else probably has. 

I’ve been watching a lot of shows (haven’t we all tbh) lately and seeing people living normally onscreen makes me so sad. I’ve become so used to how we’re living now that it sometimes trips me out to see people without masks on TV. I hate that going to the grocery store gives me intense anxiety now and that Wal-Mart feels like a goddamn battle zone for me lmao. I hate how paranoid and helpless I’ve been feeling. I hate that I’m afraid to leave my house and fear every time my loved ones do too. I hate that my boyfriend and I feel like we’re in a long distance relationship when he’s only 40 minutes away haha. I hate that I can’t hold my baby cousin and see his chubby lil face. I hate that I can barely see my loved ones outside of the house and I worry about them every day. I hate that I have to plan how I can do basic things like going to the post office or going to work just to minimize exposure. I hate that the government where I live is basically useless in keeping us safe and they just keep prioritizing money over our health. I hate that almost no one in Hawai’i (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. 

My OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it’s so emotionally draining. And it doesn’t help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don’t follow. Whenever I get home from work or the store, it’s like a 30 minute process of sanitizing all my belongings that I brought, showering, washing my clothes, and cleaning my hands a million times. But my family doesn’t do the same so I’m worried that it’s all for nothing. We’ve luckily been ok for the most part and I feel privileged to be able to say that. I feel a little silly complaining, but as a house full of essential workers (aside from my dad who got fired from his job at the beginning of COVID after 19 years) I’m just constantly on edge. I just wanna protect all my loved ones and I feel like I can’t. And I know I can’t. I just wish I could. 

I just needed to vent because like everyone else, I just feel so drained. But I still feel lucky to have what and who I have at the same time. I just wish this was over already. It feels like it won’t ever be.",anxiety

"It’s insane to me how different things are when you are severely depressed/anxious , vs. when you are not. It disguises itself as something important. When you’re not so low mentally and for once you feel great, the things you worry yourself to death over all day every day when you are struggling, are the same things you are proud of when you are not struggling. When you feel whole again and not like every decision is life and death. 

The things some people don’t understand about the people who commit suicide/think about suicide, is that we do not want to die. We just want to escape the pain that we can’t seem to putting ourselves through. I promise there is hope. Please keep going, I’m speaking from experience of doing some things I don’t even want to type to myself, you will see that light again that you once saw in life. You will smell things, look at things, listen to things, become genuinely intrigued with what people say, or everyday hobbies. 

I promise this bullshit is not permanent. Just keep finding yourself and growing. You are still growing emotionally, spiritually, etc, even when you don’t think you are. And one day you will all of a sudden realize, “holy shit, I’ve came so far mentally from that pit I used to be in. “

"Anyone always have a show playing in the background to help anxiety? For me it started a few years ago when I lived by myself and I couldn't take the complete silence. It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

Edit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. Pretty awesome that all of us here have the same experience, makes me feel less like a weirdo because my ex used to always be amazed how I can just rewatch the same show over and over for weeks.

"Hadn’t Left the house in four years update. Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn’t able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn’t see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.

I drew how anxiety feels to me sometimes. ,anxiety
"Feels like I am constantly bracing for the next ""bad thing"" to happen to me. Title pretty much sums it up. I feel like I can never relax, never live fully or happily, because I am simply constantly mentally preparing myself for whatever next bad thing will happen to me. For example, I finally met this pretty great person, we had a great time, and yet somehow, even when I was most happy with them, I was mentally preparing myself for the inevitable fact that it would fall apart (and it did, but, granted, that was because of lockdowns and stuff).

Health worries are also pretty prominent. Whenever I'm pretty healthy, I can never enjoy it, because I frankly am just getting ready and thinking about what next health woe will be thrown my way and how I will be miserable because of it. Even now, I have a problem where I literally can not stop thinking about worst case scenarios, regardless of likelihood. I have done everything I can -- called my specialist, set up an appointment, and will receive the next step in treatment, and I have refilled my current medication to treat it. And yet, here I am, worrying obsessively about infection or something -- despite me having this problem for three years and my worst case scenario not coming true. (\*\*knock on wood\*\*).

I can't relax. I can't stop bracing for the next bad/uncomfortable thing to happen, and even when I am doing everything I possibly can, I don't feel good enough to live my life. I am tired and miserable. I know I need a therapist, but office closures make it tough to do so, especially as I want to see one in person.

"Who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life? To give a brief backstory, I graduated college in Spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at Starbucks. About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn’t already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn’t pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I’ve been doing great! I’ll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!

Now, since about April, I’ve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I’m not doing enough. I’ve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it’s always been a hobby.)  But I’m feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can’t find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine.

We all have that thought of “this looks so dumb” , “why am I doing this?” when about to post online on a subreddit, and in social media in general... 

Know all those TikTok “famous people” ?? They are human, too. They probably were sure as ducky duck scared to post online for others to view , judge , comment , like , etc.,, but now look? They are perfectly okay with posting whatever — even sometimes the silliest, stupidest things... those who comment “I wish I had the ability to do what you do” ... *You can*

"Corona killed my anxiety Basically,  having to work from home and not go out to socialise has given my mind and body a much needed break.  

Working from home means that I don't have a lot of the job related anxiety that makes me dread Sundays and Mondays. I am also able to save on the 2 hours of commute and so I have a lot more free time.  

Not having to wake up early means I get 8 plus hours of sleep every night. I didn't realise how much lack of sleep was affecting my mood.  

Not having to go out means I no longer need to worry about my IBS related stomach problems. I also no longer feel pressured to socialise (im an introvert by nature and love staying at home and playing games / watching tv). 

With all the time I have, I finally feel like I am no longer running behind the ball, and have the time to reset, rest and do the things I love, without judgement.

"I decided to fight for net neutrality, even with social anxiety. It has been the easiest thing ever. I am sure all of you have seen the posts across Reddit about the fight to keep net neutrality, and the FCC upcoming vote to dismantle it. Personally, I feel that we need to keep net neutrality, but you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. I don't want to get into the politics of it all, but I'm sure you can find that elsewhere on Reddit.

So this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when I get social anxiety. Just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes — whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology — it makes me nervous just thinking about it. So you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion — something I rarely do as it is because I worry about alienating people or making them upset. Especially when it comes to politics.

The main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... What do I say? My representative doesn't share the same political beliefs I do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? Is there something special I need to do when they pick up? Maybe I should just hang up...

**First off**, I used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your ZIP code. Plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. Literally, I said this word for word: ""Hello. I just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. So... um... yeah, I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I would like you guys to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. I would really like if you guys would contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. I don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the FCC from getting rid of the existing rules. So um... that's all. Thanks.""

**Secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer — often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. They were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. There wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.

**And finally**, I didn't hang up! I stuck with it, and just read the script. When the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom — it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, ""You're doing great!""), and it automatically calls the next representative.

-----

At the end of the day, I felt relieved that I did it. I was so anxious about it at first! But when I spoke with these people, they didn't say much of anything, and I didn't feel scared because I realized their whole job is listening to people complain. The guy on the other end of the phone is just some dude who literally listens to calls all day and just forwards your comments to the man or woman in charge. The most that was said to me was when they asked for my address and ZIP code to confirm I lived in their district. That was it.

Long story short: even with my anxiety issues, I found it to be easier than I expected, and it made me feel like I accomplished something.

P.S. My first attempt was in the evening, after my representatives' offices had closed. I did this because I didn't want to talk to someone on the first try. So I just left them messages on their voicemail expressing my opinion, but I found that sometimes their voicemail was full. So I need to try again the next day, because otherwise, I'm not being heard.

**tl;dr:** I expected to feel huge social anxiety calling my representatives to support net neutrality. Turned out to be the easiest thing ever, and made me feel like I made a huge accomplishment regarding my condition. It also means I actually did something that allowed me to voice my opinion, which made me feel good.",anxiety

I didn't mind the comments that had actual criticism on the ink itself, but there were just so many comments just shitting on me and enjoyment over it.

"Does anyone else find themselves having anxiety about having to get up early in the morning? I'm 27. I've been trying to get to the root of my anxiety and this morning, while driving to work, it dawned on me (no pun intended) that the source of my anxieties might have to do with my disdain of having to get up early for work.

I have a problem where I can't stop thinking about work during weekends, when I'm home at night, on vacation, etc. Work dominates my thinking, but in an unproductive way. I don't go over anything specific, I simply ruminate about the fact that I have to do it. A lot of it has to do with my disdain of not being able to have full control over my time and having to sacrifice so much of my life to a job.

I typically end up having a decent day at work, nothing wild. Every now and again I'll have a hell day. I often fear having those days, weeks in advance, and they typically never come, but they eventually do. 

Going back to my time, a massive hurdle for me is accepting that I need to get to bed early so that I can have enough energy for the following day. There is something about that...and it makes me feel powerless. It feels like the rest of my life is just a waiting room for work but I realize how absurd that sounds. I know it's untrue, but we also live in such a hyper industrial and profit-addicted capitalist society that I know (unfortunately) that what I'm saying has some form of validity to it, and I wish it weren't so.

Anyone else experience this? I'm a grown guy with a career and yet here I am, at the best job I've had to date, miserable about having to go to it because it means I don't have full control over my time.",anxiety

I'm really glad about that. It was tempting just to have someone next to me. Waiting for real love is worth it, even when you feel like you'll never meet your soul mate. We met on tinder of all places! After years of feeling alone in the world, I finally feel part of a team. Don't give up!",anxiety

&#x200B;

**Note to Self**

* Give it 20 minutes.
* When you have a negative thought, replace it with a positive one or make up a positive one and fake it til you make it.
* The more I say “fuck it”, the better I feel.
* It’s just your thoughts.
* I don't know what's going to happen in the future but I know everything is going to be okay.
* You got this. You know you're competent enough so that you won't fail in life.
* What’s the worst that can happen if you fail? Nothing.
* Look at the grand scheme of things. Don’t focus so much in the moment. There will be a tomorrow.
* You don’t have to do anything.
* It’s not what I have to do. It’s what I want to do.
* If you feel doomed, that’s because that’s what anxiety tends to do. It escalates a situation that, in reality, isn’t going anywhere.
* Don’t be afraid of your anxiety.
* You are the play, and the world is your audience.
* You shouldn’t be scared. Treat the event or activity as a challenge or opportunity.
* Why do you feel like you have to do anything? You don’t have to do anything.
* The best thing to do is not think about it.
* Staying in the situation will teach your body that everything is ok and there’s nothing to worry about.

(I know some things on this list repeat but I left them there for reinforcement)

&#x200B;

**4-7-8 Breathing Technique**

* First, let your lips part. Make a whooshing sound, exhaling completely through your mouth.
* Next, close your lips, inhaling silently through your nose as you count to four in your head.
* Then, for seven seconds, hold your breath.
* Make another whooshing exhale from your mouth for eight seconds.
* Repeat.

&#x200B;

**AWARE Calming Technique**

* Accept the anxiety. Don’t try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.
* Watch the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.
* Act normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don’t try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.
* Repeat the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet, then repeat the steps. You’ll see that you’ll calm down soon.
* Expect the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don’t focus on what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.

&#x200B;

**Other**

* As cliched as it sounds, I really recommend trying to live one day at a time. You're overwhelming yourself by trying to do too much/fix too much/make too many decisions at once. Try to breath, enjoy each day as it comes, and give yourself small goals to get back on track.

I’m afraid to reach out to others — I’ve definitely pushed a lot of people away this year. I don’t know how or if I can bounce back to whatever my *normal* was.

"I (F17) told my dad about my anxiety and got unexpected reaction Posted it on r/relationship but got removed. The mods told me to post here instead.




English is not my first language so please neglect any mistakes. I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.


So this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few ""hmm""s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as ""crazy"". I refused and went to sleep.

The next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. 

I've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ❤️

"I (41M) stood up for myself in a relationship for the first time in my life. It cost the relationship but I feel great about valuing my needs. Use meds if you can people. I wish I started sooner. She told me kissing me wasn't worth it. She said she won't be able to give me a family I wanted so what's the point. She could have been discussing the weather. 

She then in the same breath asked me to help her with a presentation. 

She is a doctor. Makes 4 times more then I do. She is accustomed to getting her way. Saying things without consequences. 

Not this time. Not with me. 

 I stood up. Told her she needs to reevaluate her wants in life and I'm going to give her her space. 

I left. She messaged me. She wanted me to go on a trip with her. She said she was willing to pay.

 I asked her ""what's the point?"". 

Before meds I would have been at her beck and call. I would have been in shambles. I would have given her opportunities time and time again. 

I will miss her mother. I will miss her dogs. I won't miss being treated that way. I am saddened that I'm alone again. But I'm effin proud that I drew my line in the sand and refused to budge. 

If you have the opportunity to seek help, use meds etc please do so. The power and self worth that comes with less anxiety is amazing.

"Does anyone wake up hours before alarm because you are anxious about something that next day? Happened to me today!

Barely slept and still had 3 more hours to sleep but my body noped out of that and woke me up.

What am I supposed to do with those 3 hours???

Worry more???

"Was suicidal with anxiety eight years ago...getting married on Saturday. Eight years ago today I had had enough and sat on the sea wall at midnight about to throw myself in. Single, victim of DV, no full time job. I had terrible flashbacks, panic attacks, couldn't sleep. Now I'm still anxious but medication has helped enormously. I have a permanent full time job I love, a partner I love and I got to see my boys become fine young men. See your doctor. You can get through this x",anxiety
"Just overheared my parents calling me dumb for not getting over my anxiety yet. I went downstairs to drink water and I overheard my parents saying that I'm dumb for still having anxiety and it would be solved if I went outside more.
My parents seem to think that I am inexperienced and if I simply went outside more and stopped caring my anxiety would magically go away.

I'm sure the only reason I have anxiety in the first place is because of them.

They like to say all of my problems are ""anxiety"" and ""being bored"" and they think I was pretending to have depression because I'm able to laugh.",anxiety
"I hate how, since we were young, society has engraved on us that we should have our lives figured out on our 20s. I've been living like a robot these past few days and I've been telling myself to numb everything so I wouldn't get hurt. How nice would it actually be to not think and feel at all huh. It doesn't help that the people around me see this robot as a 'strong' person who can stay composed at the face of adversity. I'm not strong and I wish I can just yell it out but that would cause more pain within the family that would only end with one affected party, which is, *surprise surprise,* me. I don't have my life figured out at 20 and my mind is very persistent in chasing this hourglass time limit of succeeding in life. I know and understand that we all have our paces and that nothing is ever easy in life but why won't this mind just stop thinking. Even as I'm writing this my heart is doing its thing and it just hurts.",anxiety
"Job hunting when you have an anxiety disorder... I honestly feel like if there was one thing that could perfectly trigger my anxiety attacks and tick all of the boxes that trigger my panic attacks, it would be job hunting. And it has.

Questioning my overall self-worth? Check.

Questioning my few skills? Check.

Panicking at long job descriptions where the words blur together from said panic and nothing makes sense because my brain stops functioning as my heart palpitates and my hands shake? Check.

Feeling like an overall failure because I don’t qualify for/get rejected from a job? Check.

Becoming overstimulated and hyperventilating from the sheer amount of positions to scroll through? Check.

“They expect *all* 45 bulletpoints of this from me? I’m not capable, I’m just a jack of all trades, my brain would explode on a daily basis, I can’t do this.” Check. 

Re-doing my resume 35 times because it’s just never *perfect* enough? Check.

Not being able to decide what I want to do with my life and thus experiencing an overwhelming desire to just give up? Check.

Catastrophizing my situation, which then turns into full blown panic attacks on a weekly basis because I haven’t heard back from any jobs and thus being convinced I’ll be unemployed forever? Check.

Job hunting is a soul-sucking experience for everyone involved. At the same time, I’m convinced it’s one of the most unbearable experiences for people who struggle with GAD. Or at least it seems to be for me.

Typing this after waking up today to find myself finally recovering from two straight days of panic attacks coupled with some fabulous depressive episodes thrown in. I was knocked completely out of commission after a week of overworking myself with the job hunt, and spent two days crying, shaking, taking Ativan when needed, and feeling like “nothing will ever be okay again”.

*Sigh.*

Back at it.

"If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...  A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you’re not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it’s a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It’s easy for us to fall in the trap of “freezing” and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. I have mine with a list of good things in life/things I enjoy doing/reminders that I’ve struggled for years and... I’m still here!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone <3

"What having Anxiety look like: No motivation. 
Isolating yourself. 
Listening music to escape from reality. 
Craving unhealthy food.
Pushing people you love away.
Biting nails.
Your leg shaking uncontrollable. 
Spill mascara. 
Shortness of breath.
Overthinking. 
Negative thinking. 
Sleep problems.
Sleeping  to escape from reality. 
Crying.
Disassociation. 

Having anxiety is probably one of the most lonely,  most isolating things to have. Because you are your own worst enemy.  And you live inside your head.

A big hug to all of us ♡",anxiety
"DAE feel like their anxiety was taught/acquired through traumatic experiences and the ""real you"" is completely opposite from the person your anxiety makes you? For example, I can be really really anxious and unsure in social situations, but sometimes when I can overcome it, I find myself very easily and very confidently talking to people. It feels like that person is the ""real me"" who just gets smothered by uncertainty and anxiety.

As in, I don't think my personality is anxious or shy or unsure, but I so rarely get to see that part of myself because I'm constantly bogged down with anxieties.",anxiety

"Got cured of Generalized Anxiety Disorder! Here's what worked for me! Hey guys, I have been an avid follower of this sub for a long time and this place has been a constant source of panic attack relievers over the last few months. In my last session with my therapist, he told me that GAD is cured after 6 months of literal hell and dedication. I want to share what worked for me.

**Background:** As with my fellow GAD sufferers, I have been suffering from constant worries and usual panic attacks over the last few years but I decided to take action about this (didn't know it was GAD back then) after a full-blown attack that lasted for hours and hours in early May this year. Started my treatment late May. In one of the panic attacks I was contemplating committing suicide but thank god I had the courage to stick to my routine.

**Symptoms:** Luckily, never had any physical symptoms but diarrohea and mouth ulcers were common because of cortisol developed by Amygdala.

**Aftermath:** I am waking up everyday with a buoyant mood and my life including social life, dating life and academic performance, all have improved!

So, let's finally begin:

1. **Therapy:** Can't emphasize this more, CBT therapists will identify the problematic and impractical thought patterns associted with your Anxiety( especially if it's Cortex-based) and suggest you ways to cope with them via ABCDE, RRR techniques and so on. Some of these will work for you will and some not but these people are medical experts and you need to spend 2-3 months with a therapist before deciding to discontinue/move to a different Therapist. Self-therapy books do help but it's always better to have someone in the form of close friend or a therapist to assist in your journey.
2. **Reading Books:** Rewire your Anxious Brain, The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety, and My Age of Anxiety,  are the top 3 books I recommend. Finally, I'd suggest reading posts on this sub. **Caution:** there are chances of feeling uneasiness or having panic attacks by reading few content so make sure you tell your brain that this is medicine beforehand
3. **Meditation:** atleast 2-3 times in a day for 12.5 mins everyday. It's only one day in the last 6 months I missed doing this wonderful thing.Buddhist style of meditation worked for me. Mantra meditation, guided meditation are other alternatives. There are wide variety of resources available online. It could be possible that you don't see the effects in the initial few weeks but I'd suggest keep doing it blindly.
4. **Gym:**  6 days a week non-stop in the last 6 months except for the weeks when I was travelling. It's scientifically proven that doing physical activity for more than 20 mins almost everyday improves mental health. Technically, doing exercises helps the body release endorphins that rearrange the synapse between the neurons if done for 10 weeks to see a significant results. This is massive in improving thought patterns
5. **Being open:** Being open about your anxiety with your closed ones will enable to learn new strategies, perspectives and many more things. More importantly, you will have shoulders to fall upon during a full-blown panic attack

**Others:** practicing gratitude daily, practicing my hobbies( soccer).

"i had to leave a movie theater last night. Movie theaters have always freaked me out because they are, well, a target for shootings.

I still try to go. I have fun and it's a good way to get out of the house.

Last night I went to the premier of a movie. I was already feeling pretty bad because there was a line out the door, which we didn't expect because our town is so small and filled with old people and oilfield workers. But it was whatever, we got through and went into the theater.

Right as my heart began to try to settle, a man in the row next to me begins talking about his *gun.* that he *brought.* he made 2 remarks about it - the first one i tried to brush off because i thought i misheard him. the second one i did NOT mishear.

so my heart starts racing again and i'm shaking and starting to cry. i tried SO hard to keep it together because i was with my fiance and we were trying to have a date, yanno? but they were super understanding and did not mind at all that we had to go.

i know that i overreacted but i just really can't wrap my head around being comfortable in a confined space with a random stranger carrying a lethal weapon. especially at a premier night at a theater.

just wanted to vent i guess.",anxiety

"I'm angry at everyone who didn't notice I was struggling as a child This turned out to be quite a long ramble/vent but I just needed someone to listen.

I recently started the long process of getting a diagnosis and help for my anxiety. I haven't even gotten to a psychiatric nurse yet, not to speak of a doctor or an actual psychiatrist, but I have talked to the nurse who took first initiative in my case. She was very kind and offered to meet me face to face a few weeks before the psychiatric nurse appointment so I wouldn't have to wait well over a month to get any progress at all. During my appointment with her we quickly got to at least one of the reasons as to why I'm so anxious and it helped me realise that I have actually been prone to anxious behaviour from a young age.

What's now bothering me is that after the appointment I started to realise that I was indeed displaying signs of anxiety or trauma responses as a child but none of the adults in my life actually noticed it or cared enough (or maybe knew enough) to do something about it. Absolutely no one. I had both of my parents and many many teachers who just ignored all of it and that is probably one of the reasons I'm such a mess today. I did not get the help I needed as a child and now everything is a million times worse.

Now every time I get an anxious spell I cannot stop thinking about how the people who were supposed to care for me failed me horribly. It got even worse yesterday when my mother told me a story of her completely ignoring some quite alarming behaviour because she thought it was just a quirk of mine. I had an event I consider traumatic during my first ever swimming lesson in 1st grade. Long story short, the swimming instructor was angry screaming at me because I, as a 7 or 8 year old child, couldn't float on my own yet. After this event I completely stopped doing everything that had to do with swimming even though playing in the lake with floaties on was one of my favourite summer activities before the incident. I didn't continue swimming until over 5 years later when I finally learned how to swim due to mandatory swimming lessons as a part of school sports. Even now almost 20 years later I get anxious at the smell of swimming pools and chlorine and I avoid swimming halls, especially the one where it happened.

Yet somehow, my own god-damn parent, who was often overprotective of me, didn't think there was anything alarming about that. She was telling the story like it was just a weird little thing I chose to do, one of those funny little childhood anecdotes. And the swimming incident is just one of the many different events I remember, where I displayed anxiety symptoms and no one took them seriously. I just want to be angry and scream at everyone who did not notice my problems but that's never going to happen and I know that one day I will just have to make peace with the fact that most of them will never know how badly they failed me. But today is definitely not that day.",anxiety

"Have you ever felt anxious because everything in your life is going on perfectly, but you are worried about something wrong that might be happening without you realize it?

One thing that I recently noticed I do when I’m anxious is I rewatch shows or movies. It’s not something new, but its something I realized just now. I have rewatched The Regular Show in it’s entirety for the 4th time now as well as a handful of other shows. I have watched my favorite Disney films again and again over the course of this past year. One impressive feat (for me at least) is I have watched all of South Park 3 times now lol. It’s something that feels familiar to me I suppose so it helps calm me down?

I've never learned how to swim, never learned how to drive, never had sex, never been in a relationship, and never left my hometown. I am a 15 year old in an adult body. Barely passed high school and college (<3.0 GPA). Got fired from my first professional job during college in under a year for performance issues. Graduated college and haven't found a full-time job after almost two years. Still live at home. Feel like imposter around people my age and younger in long-term relationships, marriages, and careers. 

I was diagnosed with GAD in my last year of university and have been through five therapists on-and-off over the past ten years. I was never really one to blame my upbringing for personal issues, but it's difficult not to resent my parents and society to some extent. Single mother, absent father, low-income household. The impact it's had is obvious, and I recognize the same emotional immaturity and dysfunction across my family. 

The acute anxiety I experienced in my teens and early 20's has shifted toward an increasingly all-consuming grief of my adolescence. It is becoming harder to wake up in the morning. My last hope is landing a decent job and being able to buy some lost time, but at 26+ it's hard not to feel like my inexperience is exponentially insurmountable toward developing a fulfilling career and intimate relationships.

At first I was confused as to how to feel about it, I just felt numb. But then I started eating, without a thought in my head. No nausea, no dry throat, no rapid heartbeat.

I have gone into panic attacks because I feel nauseous. I will do *anything* not to vomit even though I know it's completely irrational and stupid. I haven't been diagnosed with any phobia, but I'm pretty sure it is a phobia. Anyways, this anxiety will make me nauseous, and then nausea will make me more anxious until I'm in a feedback loop.

"Anyone else feel a need to just get away from their life? Not just in the sense of stay at home in bed but to actually get out and find an ideal looking wilderness to just stay in. No phone, no contact with anyone other than someone or something you choose to bring with you and no concerns or responsibilities.

Hopefully I'd build a cabin, live off the land and just stay there with my partner (and maybe a dog) with everything that we need around us. There wouldn't be the need to talk to anyone else, no unecessary conversations and no awkward silences to make my anxiety go through the roof trying to think of what to say.

"I’ve started therapy for my anxiety I just wanted to tell someone, just anyone.

Its like talking to someone and telling them about stuff you cant explain to other people. The fact that i’m doing it makes me feel better.

I finally got the guts to talk to a therapist after 2 years. It was definitely there for longer, but i noticed it was getting worse 2 years ago. I got my guts together and i took the plunge last week.

Just wanted to put it out there somewhere since i dont want to tell anyone i know yet

Edit: Oh wow, so many of you responded and upvoted, I'm in complete awe! It means so much to me! Thank you so much!

**Edit #2: I WISH ALL OF YOU THE BEST IN YOUR LIVES! YOU'VE ALL MADE MY DAY!**

Edit #3: I'm so happy i posted here! I felt so alone because I hadnt told anyone and you guys are so nice! I cant even describe how happy I am! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!

Edit #4: As a medical student, I think it's my duty to tell you guys that the treatment for anxiety is based on therapy and medication. Anxiety is due to your negative thoughts due to any past experiences. You need therapy to fix your thought process, and that decreases or even eliminates anxiety If you have really bad anxiety, medication will help you cope. But it's not the solution because your bad thought process is still there. Meds are good to get your symptoms in control.

You need therapy in all cases of anxiety. 

You do not always need meds. Meds are for those people who are having a harder time coping with their symptoms

And your first therapist might not be amazing. You have to search for one that fits you. You need to experiment with therapists till you find one for you, and when you do, have faith and trust in them!",anxiety

"Does anyone else feel intense anxiety about having kids in the current world/political/economic climate? I want kids. I've always wanted to be a parent. I'm fortunate enough to be in the financial position to do this reasonably well. 

All of that aside, it almost feels unethical to bring new life into the world as it is. I guess looking back on history, this is still in a lot of ways one of the easiest times to be alive... but I just can't get over this intense anxiety that things are about to get so much worse and that my children's future will just be, well, awful.

"I drowned my baby sister in my mom's birthday First of all, excuse my English.

This happened almost 8 years ago, I was 8 and she was about 4.

It was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, I was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to ""give me back.""

My mother has told me several times that it wasn't my fault, but things will never be alright, I know that she is still disgusted of me.

I will never stop feeling guilty, I am really sorry. There is nothing I can do to feel better.",anxiety

"I quit my six-figure job to recover This was possibly the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make. I’ve been at this job for 5 months now and the workload was immediately unmanageable for one person but I kept pushing through thinking I was just weak, I needed to work harder. After all this was an opportunity of a lifetime and others would kill to have this job!

It got to a point where my anxiety and depression was out of control. I dreaded work every morning and was crying 3 times a day every day for a month. I couldn’t stomach any food until dinner time. I wasn’t taking breaks and I was doing 12 hour days. Exercise was out of the question of course.

I knew I needed to quit but I felt like I couldn’t. I didn’t want to be that person that gives up. On top of that I felt incredibly guilty that if I did quit, my workload would be dumped on my boss and the team. I was (and still am) anxious about what people think of me. Do they think I’m a quitter?

All I was focused on was others and I forgot about me. How sad is that. 

The past week I managed to scrounge up the pieces of myself scattered across the floor and peel myself out of bed at 6:30 to run in the morning. I may have severe anxiety and depression but this is the one thing I can do for myself. 

I still have this nagging thought that I am crazy to throw away this salary but at the end of the day no amount of money is worth trading in my mental health for.

I don’t have a fully laid out plan of what I’m going to do but all I know is right now I need to heal and recover. Financially I am okay and my angel of a partner is supporting me in this.

I am by no means on the other side yet but I thought I would put this out into the world for anyone else who feels stuck in their job and afraid to quit. Feel free to DM.

UPDATE: Writing this update on 10 June 2022 (a week out from 1 year ago). Thank you to everyone that commented at the time. Your encouragement really helped me through a tough time. Over the past year I have consistently received private messages from people that have gone through or are currently going through the same situation.

At the time of my original post I felt so alone because I couldn’t find other people going through the same thing. I thought I would just be sending a rant into a black hole and it wouldn’t mean much but it has really been worth putting out there just to see how many people have reached out and the conversations that have come from it. 

As an update, I took 2 glorious months off and looking back, quitting was the best decision I ever made. I was ashamed and guilty for a while but I had the gift of TIME. To do things I wanted to do that had nothing to do with work and to heal. Of course I had incredible support so I could focus on building myself back up. I’m now back at work at a previous job (before the heinous one referred to above) and I’m doing well. I still have anxiety obviously but off anti-depressants now.

If you’re ever in the same broken state I was, I know that hesitation so well. I know its a tough decision but I still 100% recommend quitting. A career is not the entirety of life.",anxiety

"Does anyone else avoid the news these days? Hi, all. Is anyone else having to almost completely avoid the news right now? I almost feel like it's ""attacking"" me when I listen to it or watch it, ramping up my anxiety levels & frankly making me feel almost paranoid. I'm having to stay off Twitter entirely, and off FB as much as possible. It's all so awful most of the time, and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel a bit guilty sometimes, thinking that as an adult I've got a duty to keep up with the news, and also, as a Christian, I ought to be aware of what's going on in the world so I can at least pray for it. I have trouble even talking about certain subjects now, because it can set me down deep, dark rabbit holes and trigger a depressive episode. And, although I feel really lonely and isolated, I still need to be careful what I expose myself to - for example, a friend of mine keeps pushing really scary conspiracy theories which does my head in. I don't mind talking to her about almost anything else, but not that, as once I've spiralled down, it can be days before I haul myself up again!

I was trying to explain to my mother that I've got really burned out and feel hypersensitive. I'm not proud of myself for it, as I'm sure I'm not being very mature, but there's only so much fearmongering a person can take, and like many people (I suspect), I've been fearmongered half to death over the past few months.

These days, we're all connected 24/7 and there's almost no hiding from anything. We ""have"" to think about Covid all day, every day - we're not being allowed to put it out of our minds for even one second. When I was growing up, we had news programmes, of course, and newspapers, but somehow, it wasn't in our faces all the time & we could take a break from it. Also, the media seems to have been more trustworthy back then, even if it wasn't - at least, there wasn't all this fear of ""fake news"". Part of my problem these days is the feeling that i can't even trust what I read any more.

So I try to focus on other things: watching TV shows, knitting (I'm making soft toys to give to people to cheer them up a bit!), listening to audio books and podcasts, learning Irish on Duolingo and also praying, as I find that a comfort. It's hard though!

"Booked my COVID vaccine for tomorrow. Could someone reassure me I’m doing the right thing? My anxiety has been a living nightmare lately. The talk of vaccines and Covid has also been mentally draining me, and I feel so scared. 

I finally booked my vaccine, because I know I need to pick between this vaccine or this illness. 

As a mom, I feel I need to be strong and I need to vaccinate myself to limit the spread. 

I have so much health anxiety lately. I’m worried I’m going to have an anxiety attack and think the symptoms of anxiety are side effects of the vaccine. 

I just need reminders and reassurance I’m doing the right thing. That I’m going to be okay and still be able to be a mom.

"Has anyone had their anxiety reduce by decluttering/tidying up the living space? I'm not a hoarder per definition (I don't think), but I do have a lot of stuff. Many things I don't really know what to do with. Hobby stuff from parents, old school books etc....they saved too many things. I also have several projects started but never finished.

There is a lot of nostalgia attached to these items, so they also feel comforting in a way.

But I've started to think if I may reduce my anxiety by simplifying, as the things also seem to take up a lot of mental energy for me.

I notice when I've been out biking/walking that my anxiety increases a lot when coming back to my house.

"Anyone else getting really anxious with all the COVID restrictions lifting? I am slowly realizing where my anxiousness has come from over the last couple of days. I have been handling my anxiety quite well over the last few months after having figured out some of my major trigger. With numbers going down in my city, restaurants are opening back up and people want to meet and socialize I have felt much more anxious over the last few days. 

I got quite comfortable in my covid routing and bubble over the last year. It hasn't taken all of the anxiety away but reduced the social aspect by a lot (maybe not to my long term advantage though). 

I have vacation time planned in the next few weeks and just had an anxiety attack over planning on where to go/what to do for just a couple of days. Last year a friend and I planned to take a trip together, which we now had to cancel because I could not get vaccinated early enough. Now we want to spend the time together in some other way and while trying to find some options closer to home I realized what I have been so anxious about. Going out, meeting other people, stepping out of my routine and comfort zone. Its crazy. I used to thrive with travel and new cultures/people and today I caught myself hoping that guidelines won't be relaxed so that I have a good excuse to stay in my bubble.... 

I have honestly no idea what to do with this. I need to stay careful and take precautions for my physical health (pre-existing conditions) while I cannot neglect my mental health but am not sure if its better to just go for it or let my anxiety dictate my vacation plans and social life again....

"I hate constantly feeling like someone is mad at me It’s so tiring to constantly worry and have to check with people if they are mad. It makes people feel like I make everything about myself. When in reality I just need to make sure nobody is upset. I have a constant need to be liked and loved. I know everybody pretty much wants these things. But I get sick and feel extremely horrible when I even get a slight hint that someone might be upset with me. It’s just so tiring. I hate it and I feel like I can never be completely normal. I’ve made immense progress but it’s never going to be normal again. I can’t stop feeling guilty for everything I’ve ever done. And when I confess to family members about my guilt they act like I’m worrying about nothing. 

I obsess over things that happened years ago. And can’t let them go ever. I just cannot stop obsessing over things that probably didn’t even involve me or that nobody remembers or cares about anymore. I’m tired of thoughts that I’m a horrible person. I’m just so tired of it. It gets old to never feel comfortable with myself. The only times I do is when I’m in a group of people having fun. And I’m able to make them laugh. Whenever I’m alone and that connection is gone I just panic.

At this point I’m worried that I must be high maintenance and just need a lot of attention. I just want people to like me. I literally cannot stand the thought of people hating me. And I know there’s gotta be people out there. I know and understand why people get upset at my guilty feelings and confessions. It’s just hard to stop. I feel like I need reassurance which is a short lasting fix.


Edit: I’m kinda thinking this might be because I’ve forgotten my anxiety meds for a few days. Uhhh whoops. Well im going to get back on track and see how that helps. But I’m so nervous I can’t stop hyper focusing on one situation and it’s been a year and it wasn’t even a big deal when it happened

What helps me calm down is my routine of checking if people have blocked me or not (nobody has blocked me so far) and window shopping on Mercari for squishmallows with factory errors.",anxiety
"Society treats those with anxiety like garbage I've seen how most people treat someone whose anxious. Society treats those who are anxious or timid like garbage, play things to troll and fuck with. It's not just young people who bully those who are anxious, there's a culture of not taking anxious people seriously, not at all trying to sympathize with reasons why they might be that way.

People are animals, if you show even the slightest nervousness they pounce, they double down and try to stress you more, or laugh at you, ect. I've seen this from young, middle aged and old, from people of all cultures and background, it's absolutely disgraceful.

Suicide rates don't surprise me at all.",anxiety
"I haven't self harmed in one whole year. The last time I self harmed was about a year ago. (I know, even more depressing because it was near Christmas!)

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.
Learn to love your brain <3

Merry Christmas guys x",anxiety
"Does anyone else feel like their friends and family secretly hate them and so you are terrified to talk to them and make things worse but you’re probably just being paranoid? Just me? I feel like all of my friends actually don’t like me and “put up with me,” or that every good relationship I’ve ever had I’ve ruined—even though when I’m being rational I don’t see anything terribly wrong that I’ve done. I just feel so much anxiety around them, as if my every move could ruin another friendship. Or I get so anxious that I disappear from the friendship entirely and that’s why they don’t like me anymore, because I abandoned them. It eats up at me. I’m so afraid to hang out with my friends because I’m afraid they will think badly of me, but then our friendship drifts apart.",anxiety
"I’m very grateful for my cat It’s 2:00am and I just woke up in a panic. This happens at least 3 times a week. My heart is racing and I’m breathing fast and I can tell that a tunnel of anxiety is about to consume me. Initially I don’t know why- probably a nightmare but I can’t remember what I was dreaming about. Then I start thinking about everything I have to do today and all the time I wasted yesterday laying around the house when I should have been getting things done. My heart is still pounding in my chest and I feel nauseas but at least my breathing has slowed.

Then, also as usual, my cat jumps on my chest, lays down and purrs softly. Focusing on petting her slowly and listening to her purr drives the anxious thoughts from my mind and gives me something else to focus on. She usually sleeps on the end of my bed but always stays on my chest until I fall asleep again.

I don’t know what I would do without her. She does this when I’m awake and anxious as well but it really helps me fall back asleep at night.

This will probably get buried but I just wanted to share. ",anxiety

"First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. 

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went ""are you okay?""

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

TL;DR I had an anxiety attack in front of my boyfriend and I thought he wouldn't reacted badly to it, but instead he held me if I needed it and backed off if I needed it and I really appreciated it",anxiety

"Guys—for the first time in my life I stopped a panic attack before it started. I felt my panic attack coming on while on my way to a talk at a recent conference I attended. It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there’s no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like “oh no you don’t!” I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy—namely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!

I’m so proud of myself, you guys. I had to share because I want you all to know that even if you’ve been struggling for years, there ARE mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. We can do this! We don’t have to be anxiety’s bitch! And that’s the best feeling in the entire world.",anxiety

"Please stop medication shaming This is a PSA to the anxiety community. It's bad enough when you get it from people who don't even understand the concept of having anxiety, it's 10x worse when it comes from people within the community who also suffer from anxiety disorders.

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are ""oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" Or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what, I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know."" She herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so, so, *shrug.*",anxiety

I don't tend to post here but I really wanted to tell someone that would not be disgusted by me. 

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency. The dentist explained to me that I have beautiful teeth that just need some TLC after not brushing them for years. I remembered that about a year ago in Aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

With all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup.

"People don't understand what anxiety is People don't understand what the impact of an anxiety disorder really is.

I really wish i could explain just how it feels to have GAD. But i don't know how so i'm just going to write what we have to deal with which people never seem to understand.

Anxiety disorders do not mean we feel anxious once in a while, it means we have to actively work on ourselves every day to live a comfortable life.

We have to regulate our diet and cut out certain food ands drinks.

We have constant tight muscles and often develop injuries because of this, not only that but stress weakens the immune system.
There is many more health issues we have or can develop because anxiety isn't just mental, it often represents itself physically.

We are unable to work or go to school because the stress of sensory input is too much. 

We can't leave our house or do regular tasks that others consider to be normal. It's a learning progress for us and we need patience.

We can be stuck in anxiety spirals for months and have anxiety attacks so bad that we lose a lot of weight because we are unable to eat, sleep or function and have very bad symptoms like puking or fainting.

We can be triggered by any stressful event and lots of things hit way harder for us like physical pain.

I wish the medical world would put more focus on anxiety so we don't have to go to the ER 3 times in one week because our anxiety attacks are so bad we literally can't do anything.

Im so tired of the mistreatment of us and people not understanding, feeling like i can never be myself or feel ""normal"" again.

I’m just trying to figure out if it’s just me. Some days I feel supercharged and extra supportive of my friends who are struggling and don’t respond to texts, video calls, online game sessions, invitations to virtually hang out, not being invited to virtual gatherings between friends, etc. I’m like “I get it, that’s ok, I understand because I know what depression is like...”

but then my (well-established) struggle with loneliness and rejection = lack of value and self-worth makes me really angry offended, then sad because I feel “god I must be so terrible, that’s why people would rather not communicate with me and instead communicate with others” 

Then I reach out or try to communicate my situation gently, (even asking honestly AITA). the response is more like “Hmm tbh I haven’t really been putting effort into doing things or seeing people. Not that I don’t ask to do things but... I just am not expecting to do anything maybe? Or expecting people to do things with me? And so, if people reach out to me, that’s cool. But if they don’t, I’m not reading into it.”

All of that sounds extremely healthy and understandable, so I repeat the cycle again. I can’t seem to feel normal in this world. It’s like dancing off beat all the time.

However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything. For example, I bought a course to learn Unity but the thought of not grasping the material and failing to deliver  something good-looking makes me too scared to even start the program",anxiety

"Does anybody else feel tightness in the chest and sinking feeling every morning before an ""event""...ANY event? Tl:dr: Am I weird for waking up with a sinking feeling in my gut on my birthday? Or is this what excitement is?

Today is my birthday. I am not big on birthdays, I don't like to celebrate it and in my opinion, this day has nothing to be celebrated about, being born was neither my choice nor my accomplishment.

Anyway, I woke up this morning at around 4 am, which is not my normal time of waking up, and I had this tight feeling in my stomach and this sinking feeling in my gut like something bad was gonna happen, I don't know how to describe it.
I am not new to this feeling, I have had it for years, before every flight I had to take, no matter what time of day, before any meeting early in the morning (even if it is a casual meeting where nothing is at stake), even so much as if I had planned to do anything in the morning, I would wake up with this weird engulfing feeling. It used to happen everyday a couple of years back, but now it's reduced to only when there is ""something"" happening..any something. 

I always thought this is my anxiety but today, it's nothing today, it's a birthday but I have absolutely nothing planned, I live with my parents and they couldn't care less about this day and I really don't want to think of this day as anything special. Why the hell am I waking up with this weird thing in my gut..is this what excitement is? Am I subconsciously excited about my birthday?

I haven't felt excited in a long time so maybe I have forgotten what it is?",anxiety

"Has anyone else had a huge increase in anxiety since covid started/got worse in the US? So I’ve always had anxiety, but I’m usually able to function pretty normally. I’m 23, and working as an engineer. My company is part of a critical industry, so we’ve been open, and I’ve worked on site everyday since the pandemic began. At first I was fine, I just did my best to stay home when I wasn’t at work. Since the fall things have slowly been getting worse, I’m constantly worried that any slight change in how I feel is covid-related, and I’m terrified of being the reason someone I care about dies of covid. It’s affected my appetite, making me lose weight, made me cry much more often than ever before, and avoid seeing even the two friends I decided to share a “bubble” with when this all began. Has anyone else experienced this? I don’t know what to do to control it or convince myself that I’m not sick when every week I have a new reason to think otherwise",anxiety

"I was just harassed in public This is why I hate going outside by myself. I simply went to get money out of a cash machine and in the parking lot there were a group of ‘men’ loitering outside their van. They started talking about my ass and how they couldn’t stop staring at it, like I was a meat product. I tried quickly to get money out of the machine and on my way out one of them slaps my ass. I felt so humiliated I ran home taking a longer route to avoid walking past them again. I want to cry. I am going out for a work meal and now I feel like I am dressed too provocatively and every person is going to think I’m a slut. I am wearing trousers and a crop top because of the hot weather. My anxiety is through the roof, I just want to curl up in bed and never go outside again.

Edit: thank you all for such supportive and kind messages. It’s so nice to be reminded that the world isn’t full of horrible people. It made me cry how supportive you all are.

"Doctor said something profound to me today He said, ""When you get anxious, your amygdala is activated. You can tell yourself that you're okay and even logically understand you are okay, but your amygdala isn't catching up yet. Just remember that you are okay, and it's just your amygdala needing time to adjust."" Basically he's saying that anxiety can persist because our hindbrain and forebrain aren't talking, but it takes time and it will eventually deactivate, so it's important to give ourselves some grace and remember, my amygdala is just aroused right now and it'll go away. Hope this also helps some of you out there.",anxiety

Example, Going out with my brother to a mall, we both suffer from Anxiety, his social anxiety been way worse than mine and all of the sudden we have some employee following us around and checking on us like we are going to steal something. Idk if they judge us for the clothes i wear or because i dnt look people in the eyes, most of the time i even wear earphones cause i dnt want people talking to me. Anyways my brother gets mad and say ""WTF he is following us for?"" And even if they don't say anything back for that moment on my brain just keep replaying that moment the rest of the day. Or been in the drive thru and asking for stuff and getting the wrong items or missing something over and over same thing happens, my brain just keep thinking about that situation.

"It's really hard to ""be strong and carry on"" when all I want to do is curl up in bed and go to sleep. I feel so tired and anxious right now, and I have so much to do, both at work and at home. There is no time to ""be weak"" or fall apart, because there's too much to do and too many expectations that I feel like I have to keep carrying on. 

I have an amazing support system in my partner, who keeps me grounded and sane, but I've had a day that started in anxiety and continued in anxiety, and will undoubtedly end in anxiety. I don't want to be strong, do chores, make dinner, stay calm at work, be in a good mood when I get home. I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and cry.

More than anything, I want to live in a society where it's okay to be weak, it's okay to fall apart, it's okay to take time off of work, not because you're physically ill, but because you're mentally ill. Where bosses know how to support their employees who are mentally ill, and check in with them, and put structure around them that allows them to still continue on with work, but not feel scared they'll get fired if they keep calling out of work or have a bad day or react badly in a meeting because they're stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed.

I'm just tired and anxious and scared, and I want to be able to feel those things and know that the world will continue on. But I can't, I have to be strong and push it all down and ""carry on,"" so that the world doesn't fall apart, and it makes my anxiety all the worse.",anxiety

"Foodies who no longer have the energy - I'm writing a cookbook to help people who no longer have the motivation to cook through depression or other issues and instead resort mainly to things like fast food, may I ask what you like to see in it? Hi everyone!

Please excuse me, I know this is a strange thing to talk about but I was recommended to pop it in here. Please remove it if it isn't allowed (and please excuse my gosh awful English!) !

For those who don't know me (which I'd imagine is everyone) I'm an ex-cook whose been dealing with depression on and off since I was 14.

Thanks to two very close friends I've been able to find ways around the lack of spoons to bring myself to cook again and I wanted to try and share the simple yet tasty recipes with people who share that same feeling.

Whilst it's a LONG way in development, I plan on it being a completely free release because it's only aim is to try and help people !

In the latest blog post there is a long(ish) list of things I will be adding, but I would love to know what kinds of recipes you guys would like to see simplified yet still just as tasty ! It can be anything, (even unhealthy ones as there is ways around it!) Vegan - Vegetarian - Meat feast or mixed!

I would also like to know if you believe this could actually be helpful. I have received some good feedback from those I pitched it to (although the website is not at all as far advanced as the book, I'm still working on that!) I would love to have a wider range of feedback than my own little circle !

"I’ve just gone 1.5 months without an anxiety attack! I haven’t had one since January. Although I had one tonight, I’m glad that I made it this far because it used to be worse. Before, I was getting them a few times per week and it was quite debilitating. I still have work to do. I had one because it was over a topic that I haven’t covered in therapy yet. However, I’m just glad that I’ve made this accomplishment.

"A cool anxiety technique I learned **Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself ""This is my anxiety"". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible!

The whole time my conscious self knew that he's not talking to me because he's focused on whatever he was reading. My subconscious self tho, was yelling at me the whole time being like ""He's pissed at you, you must have done something to upset him and he probably hates you for it!""

"Huge victory, today I faced one of my biggest fears and got a panic attack in return. Took a train and it got stuck between two stations due to a technical problem. I considered pressing the emergency button and prying open the train door. Instead, I embraced the panic attack and pulled through. I've suffered from a severe panic and anxiety disorder since i was 11. I'm 21 now, still suffering but going to a clinic soon to fix it. My worst fears are trains, busses, public places, small space and being surrounded by many people. I had an appointment at my new psychiatrist and i had to take the train, luckily it was only 2 stations away, 6 mins or so. So I got on the train and i felt surprisingly well. I actually felt great. Then the train suddenly stopped between 2 stations and i was stuck inside, no way out. Well one way out, pressing the emergency button and prying the door open which would have probably gotten me in a lot of trouble with the police. Panic hit me immediately after the the train stopped, i couldn't breathe and i felt like passing out any second. I got up and walked to the door and checked to see where the emergency button is. I actually considered pressing it. But the feeling of passing out completely overwhelmed me and i sat down on the floor and took deep breaths and tried to relax as best as i can. and guess what? It worked!! I survived the panic attack, i pulled through it and it feels f*cking amazing!! It gave me new hope and i actually believe that i'm able to overcome it. If you read everything, thank you!

She took me back to the X-Ray room, and instead of prepping me for it, she told me that she had anxiety also, and she was willing to let me sit for a while to calm down. We talked for a while, and she told me I was very strong. She told me that she knows the struggles of anxiety as well, and they are very real. She actually started crying a bit, and I asked if I could hug her, which she accepted.

"I have illness anxiety disorder, and failed to get my scheduled COVID-19 vaccine a few months ago. Yesterday I bit the bullet and got my first dose! Yayy! I'm not an antivaxxer! I believe in modern medicine. 

I was always scared of getting the vaccine, because we don't know the long-term effects of it. And I was also scared of getting it with the medication combination I'm on for my bipolar disorder, because I didn't know how it could react. 

The first time I told myself I would get it if I stop taking my medications a week prior to clear it out of my system so I can get the vaccine all by itself. That was a huge mistake, because of my bipolar disorder I became very mentally unstable which also in turn exacerbated my anxiety. And so I failed to make the appointment. 

This time, I got the vaccine and ironically I wasn't on any medication at all because my doctor took me off one medication because of it not working, and also because I've been in a major depression the last two weeks I literally forgot to take the other of the two medications for a week straight. *yes!, really it's as simple as I forgot, I know it's bad*. 

So not only did I push through the anxiety of getting the vaccine, I also got what I wanted in that I got it without being on medication. *It wasn't on purpose I swear! Haha* 

My arm hurts like hell and I feel really lightheaded and dizzy today But otherwise I'm okay. 
However I am highly unstable, because I'm not on any medication and my doctor is gone for the next two weeks on vacation. Another psychiatrist at the clinic told me not to restart my meds until I see my psych. (after stopping lamotrigine for more than five consecutive days You can't just simply restart it, You have to retitrate up to the target dose again)

The pharmacist as well as the nurse at the vaccine site said it's okay for me to take my Ativan, a benzodiazepine, before and after getting the vaccine but I decided not to because I fear mixing it with the vaccine. 

So I am just pushing through the anxiety that the symptoms are giving me and I'm doing okay! 

But I'm super proud of myself for biting the bullet and getting the vaccine as I am much more scared of catching COVID-19 than I am of the vaccine.",anxiety
"Don’t trust your anxiety! Today I got proof it isn’t always right. Today I had to do a big presentation at work to some important people. I was quite anxious as I’m still fairly new-ish to the job and still feel like a huge imposter. I’ve also got a new manager who sat in on the presentation to check everything went okay. 
I did it and when I came out the other side my anxiety was telling me it went terribly. Though I tried not to show it, throughout the presentation, the anxiety was saying, “oh god, you’re bombing, end it so the audience can stop feeling awkward and embarrassed for you.” I was sure that my manager must be quite disappointed. I fully expected to get a call from her to go over what went wrong and how to improve. 

Instead, she copied me in to an email between her and her boss giving me a “shout out” because I handled the tough questions “like a pro, giving extremely confident and good answers.” She also added that at the end, the head of department of the client I was presenting to had said the presentation was “one of the best” he’d seen and he’d found it “extremely useful and insightful”. 

I feel like she and I were at totally different presentations but it just goes to show, your anxiety is not always right about the situation and your perception does not always align with everyone else’s. 
Ignore the anxiety voice and just keep on going!

"I miss the days when I could relax, when my mind wasn't always searching for the next thing to be so overly nervous about I hear so many friends talk about how middle school was awful for them, but I look back and remember it so fondly. Not because it was my ""glory days"" or anything like that, but because it was the last time I can remember being able to enjoy life as it comes, and to take things one moment at a time. Just being able to play video games and relax without my mind wandering to ultimately pointless things to be anxious about. Being able to enjoy my hobbies, being able to go out in public without thoughts consuming me about the judgement of every stranger that walks by. I miss the days of being able to do nothing productive, and not be wrought with guilt about it.

I'm 26 now. The best way I can put things is that on paper, my life looks pretty great. Anxiety makes things pretty tough a lot of the time, as I'm sure you can all empathize with.

Like I’m a complete stranger to everyone anyway. Please tell me I’m not a total freak. The only time I can comfortably post is if I’m drunk and that results in me usually deleting them. And I shouldn’t drink anyway. I just wanted to get that off my chest.

That means I obsessively ask a lot of deep questions about reality, and the inability to find conceivable answers causes me a great deal of paralysing anxiety.

Currently I'm obsessing about the nature of time. Did everything come into being at the, well, beginning? Has something always existed? Has that something existed in eternal time, or a timeless/changeless state until time/events began? What caused them to begin?

None of the possibilities even make sense to me, and that really disturbs me.

So I decided to go to a mental hospital. Being in the calm, orderly environment helps a bit, and the doctor is very empathetic and really tries to understand what's going on in my head.

She is trying out some medications to reduce the anxiety, and other types of therapy will also be available. Luckily I live in Europe so I don't have to pay for any of this. Though food is pretty shit. 😀

Well tonight I was having a really hard day. I expressed it to her and she ignored me. She didn’t pick up on how hard my day was even though I expressed it very clearly. Later she could tell that I was even more sad and knew it had something to do with her. I didn’t want to go into detail because it would of set off a panic attack and I wouldn’t of been able to handle both my shit and her panic attack. I needed to take care of me tonight. 

So I tried to be as involved in our night as possible but let her lead and suggest what we did tonight. Obviously she could tell that my night was off and she started to become very distant. I got more upset at this because I wanted to be comforted. 

After a couple of hours she came out and said “ I know you need me tonight but I don’t know if I am strong enough.” She was talking behind a door and refused to come out. “But I just want to let you know that I love you and one day I will be able to comfort you.” 

After we kept talking she finally came out and I was able to open up and get the care and love that I needed. 

She didn’t have a panic attack. She did cry and almost went into it a couple of times but she was able to stay present and be what I needed in a partner tonight.

"Ukraine Megathread Update 4/15: A group of people from this community have created r/UkraineAnxiety

Update 4/13: We have decided to formally close this thread to new comments. We feel that this thread is too taxing for us to moderate and is no longer worth the strain on our mod team like it was back when the situation was brand new. We want to thank everyone who has stuck around to help others stay level-headed through this whole mess!

Update 3/27: Due to all the feedback we got from updates 3/20 and 3/21, we have decided to relax the requirements for posting links. You are free to post a link you want help with or to add commentary on to help others understand it in a less anxious way, and now you can once again post links to good news as well as create good news collections (see the current stickied comment which includes some info on reassurance-seeking behavior). Our one requirement is that you should refrain from posting multiple times over a short period with good news links. If someone does this we will begin taking down their comments as spam. In this case it would be better to put together multiple news links and then post them as a single comment.

*~~Update 3/21: Please see the current stickied comment for more information. It is ok to include a link that is causing you anxiety and asking people to help explain it better. It is also ok to provide a news link alongside your own commentary about the article to help people understand what it is saying in a less anxious way. We're specifically going to remove comments that have one or more news links without asking for help or providing original commentary about the article.~~*

*~~Update 3/20: We have seen a large amount of posts that are mainly about sharing/discussing specific news articles. Please remember to keep everything relevant to anxiety. If a comment is just a news link then we have decided we will have to remove it to keep the thread on topic.~~*

Hi everyone,

It has been requested that we create a megathread for all of the events that have been happening with regards to the conflict in Ukraine. We decided that this is a good idea since so many people have been experiencing extreme anxiety because of it.

We have opted to have this thread be sorted by Best for the time being. To read and respond to the latest comments you can manually change the sort to New. The reason we’re doing this is because we want the most helpful and most grounded comments to float to the top to help as many people as possible keep their anxiety under control during this difficult time.

For those who want to talk with other anxiety sufferers in more of a live format, feel free to join our official Discord server with this invite link: [https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9](https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9). We have added a special channel to it called ""#ukrainediscussion"" so people can talk about what's happening and help each other.

As always please remember to be supportive and report any problematic comments so we can remove them as soon as possible.

Thanks!

"Is it normal to feel physical symptoms of anxiety even if you are not mentally anxious about anything particular? I’ve been feeling the common physical symptoms of anxiety but I don’t know what’s causing it, and it’s been persistent for a week. 

I also have bad health anxiety so maybe focusing on it has been making me feel weird. I’m not sure. 

Does anyone else get random heat palpitations, the need to take big breaths and do breathing exercises, and also the feeling of not wanting to do anything? 

I contacted my doctor cause the heart palpitations and the need for breathing exercises usually happen at night.  
But I have to wait two weeks to have a 10 min phone call with my doctor. 

The only times I’ve ever felt this way were times when I was having such bad anxiety, but I don’t recall the heart palpitations. 

But like I said, I don’t have reasons to be THIS anxious.. unless I just don’t realize that I am actually this anxious.

I've been told by therapists before that it's at least 10 times harder for me to do any given assignment in school than most students as a result of my anxiety. I had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but I did it. 

I'm at a relatively difficult college and I even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. I also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. I genuinely don't have friends at college or groups I belong in. I have depression alongside this shit anxiety and I went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.

It may not be much, but I did it, and I made it through. And you guys can, too! 

Please never hesitate to get the support y'all need. If you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! Get doctor's notes. Most professors are more understanding than you'd think.

"Anyone else constantly have an upset stomach due to their anxiety? It’s a very specific kind of upset stomach that I get from my anxiety. It’s not a stomachache, or cramping, or “maybe I ate something bad”, it’s literally feeling sick with anxiety. I think out of all the anxiety symptoms I’ve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. 

I’ve already ruled many out other causes, and I know it’s likely only caused by my anxiety. I just don’t understand why my body and mind does this to itself. I can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally EVERYTHING 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something. No matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn’t change a thing. 

It makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. It just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. I don’t even need any suggestions for how to fix this. I don’t need to be told that I need medication or therapy. I’m just so tired of constantly feeling sick and no one understanding why or how it feels. No, taking a tums isn’t going to fix it. No, I can’t just “stop worrying”, or drink some damn ginger tea. I know a lot of suggestions come from a good place, but they don’t help.",anxiety

"Wake up feeling fine until I ""remember"" to feel anxious... anyone else deal with this? Hi all, 

Recently I've been dealing with a lot more latent anxiety than normal. I've struggled with it for years, but over the last few weeks there have been a lot of days where I've spent the entire time with a pit in my stomach. It's weird - I'll wake up feeling totally fine, then the moment I realize I'm not feeling any anxiety, it's like a switch flips and I just start accumulating it right then and there. What the hell is up with this? I'm not even having thoughts about anything specific while it builds up, it's just like I can't stop something that my brain has decided is normal. 

I think this started while I was having a rough time with a friend recently. That situation has since been resolved, but the pattern of this gnawing feeling has stayed.

"Does anyone else get super anxious or worried about any form of feedback or criticism? Like, to a crippling level.

If I get any positive feedback, I think I didn't earn it or that I'm being patronized. If I get negative feedback in any way, shape or form, I'm extremely discouraged and get too depressed to put in more effort to fix my mistakes, which leads to worse results and therefore worse criticism, and the cycle starts again. 

Or even worse, I'll just straight up refuse to ask anyone for feedback and then when I finally do work up enough courage to ask, it'll be I'm an objectively inferior state than it was before. Is this like, a common thing with anxious people or should I find a therapist lmao",anxiety

"How being ""gifted"" led me toward anxiety and a feeling of stupidity I was what one would call a ""gifted"" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety?

I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill “jinx” it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be “bad” or “unhealthy”. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she’s independent, to an extent. I want to be my own person, but i cant be independent im so scared of going into the world on my own.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle my anxiety and outlook on this?

*(edit: i did not expect this to get so many attention i dont have time to reply to everybody but just know ive read all the replies and i appreciate them so much! its so comforting to know that im not the only one who feels this way <3 )*",anxiety
A simple gif that may help you through an attack ,anxiety
Does anyone else get anxiety when someone doesn’t talk to them? Like mine gets so bad like “oh they don’t like me anymore” or “oh they don’t wanna talk to me anymore” when that’s probably not the case. Idk how to handle it ,anxiety
"I (17) finally managed to call the doctors, get an appointment and also make my way to the building and check in all on my own for the first time ever I feel so proud of myself. The amount of times I've tried to call and hung up immediately and now I'm in the waiting room. Baby steps.",anxiety
"My therapist told me I don't need further therapy sessions! I can't believe I am finally here.

The happiest news! After months of CBT, my therapist has finally told me that I no longer need further sessions for my anxiety.

I honestly wouldn't have been able to do it if it weren't for my therapist's strong and kind guidance, but she also told me to pat myself on the back for actively trying to help myself out of my situation. I went into therapy with a very strong desire to not let anxiety take over my life. I didn't hold back when telling my therapist about my anxiety attacks, every thought that bothered me, and the fears and worries that ate at my mind for hours and days on end. She was sympathetic and really helped me see through the lies my brain is telling me. 

I also did every homework, I took journaling to heart (and in the process found my new healthy hobby), I put in the work in trying out every cognitive restructuring exercise she suggested, from T charts to grounding techniques, really tried to determine which methods would work and which wouldn't, and also tried to get out more and connect with my friends and family.

And now after putting all that work, there is silence in my mind. The storm has passed and I now find myself in the calm I've long sought.

I am not *cured*, however; anxiety is part of the human condition and so cannot be completely eradicated. However, with the help of the techniques I've learned, I've been able to manage it enough for it not to bother me anymore.

There is help. There is light at the end of the tunnel. There is no harm in seeking help, and you deserve all the happiness in the world. I hope everyone in this sub finds peace.",anxiety
"Anybody else have anxiety attacks over mundane situations but feel totally numb over more serious situations. Like right now I’m freaking out because my arm is in a little pain and I’m at a friends house, it’s 4:00 am and I’m cold and I don’t have a blanket but I don’t wanna wake anybody up by going out of the room to find one or wake them up directly to ask for one. I’ve been pacing back and forth in the same spot for an hour and a half, all because I’m a bit cold and my arm hurts. Same thing happened when I spilled juice on a table at school. I started hyperventilating over spilled juice. And in slightly more serious situations, I feel totally numb and i disassociate. It’s like I’m not there and my life isn’t real. I had to confront my professor about a paper I didn’t turn in yet and when I was about to talk to him, I started to feel lightheaded, my vision stated closing in, my emotions disappeared and I started to disassociate. 

I’m sorry for this somewhat long rant/DAE question that probably doesn’t even make sense. I just hate myself for being like this and I just wanted to get me feelings out.",anxiety
"Does anyone else miss quarantine? Listen I know it’s controversial. Like many others, I lost my job, I was struggling financially, but the feeling of not having to commit to anything, wake up whenever I want, stay up until late hours, not have to socialize with anyone; I found it so relaxing in a very stressful way. I was scared shitless for the majority of it, I showered and lysol-ed my entire apartment after going to the grocery store. I had a small savings and was able to support myself which I know is not the case for a lot of people, so I do feel bad saying this, but I kind of wish we could have another lock down just so I could feel this sense of freedom again. Am I alone in this feeling?


*edit! I did not expect this to blow up as it did. I feel terrible for those who got more anxiety from staying home, I can completely understand where you’re coming from if you were in a bad situation. I lived alone at the time with my cat which was a blessing. I know many people didn’t have the means to relax as I did. And finally, I commend those of you had to work essential jobs during this time and I do not mean to denote that whatsoever. I just loved the feeling of waking up to another day of absolutely nothing on the table. No meetings with friends that I agreed to a week ago that I’m regretting now, no leaving the house unless necessary, no driving into work, just a state of pure nothingness that helped me heal in a way I never thought it would. Anyway thanks for all your responses, love you all and hope you’re doing well :)",anxiety
"Anxiety the second I wake up Does anybody else wake up normally in the morning and the second your eyes open the racing thoughts and mind just kick into overdrive? It lasts about maybe 10-15 minutes before going down, but it completely fucks up the tone of the rest of my day. 

Idk why it happens, but 90% of the time nothing is actually wrong, it’s like a chemical rush of being still in your sleeping state/waking up. 

Any idea why it happens and how do you deal with it? I have been feeling very anxious in my waking life recently dealing with health anxiety, so that’s probably it, but still, this is no fun :(

Edit: thank you so much for the responses. I’m learning a lot, but also find relief in knowing I’m not alone. I hope everyone finds some relief. Feel free to pm if you ever need to talk.",anxiety
