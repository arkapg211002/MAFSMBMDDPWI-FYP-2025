Flashbacks don't stop, I can't stop thinking about it, and can't find any logical reason for this event to have happened to me Very recently while riding my motorcycle on my way home, using the same route I've been using almost daily for over 2 years, I had an unhappy encounter with a reckless person with no self control at all. It started at an avenue, traffic was stopped, I was filtering since I was on a motorcycle, and suddenly another person on a motorcycle pops out of nowhere and tries to squeeze between me and a car, but failed because there was not enough space, so I went in front, and noticing the way he was riding, I decided to move quickly to get some distance from him, but he was following me. I was starting to go dangerously fast but I was pretty chill at the moment moving between traffic just enjoying the moment and he was trying hard to keep up, so I weaved my hand to the side for him to pass me or at least try to, but he couldn't. That made him so upset I could never ever imagine how a simple joke or something supposed to be a funny moment could startle someone like that. Moments later, when traffic was less dense, I reduced my speed, not much worried about him, but he caught up and didn't pass me, but rather started kicking my bike to try to make me lose balance and fall. I was like \"what the hell man?\" but I didn't say anything. Then I stopped and he stopped next to me looking very angry, and he suddenly starts reaching for a gun. He pulled a gun on me in the middle of the traffic, and I was just looking at him not understanding his reaction, I just said \"calm down man, I'm sorry if I did anything that bothered you\" Something along those lines (I can't remember perfectly as it was super quick and stressful). He pointed the gun at me and even hit me (it left a bruise on the side of my chest where he hit me) to intimidate. Meanwhile I was trying to not escalate things at all, because at that point I knew I was dealing with a crazy person and even the slightest form of confrontation could lead to me getting shot. I didn't complain about anything, and acted like it wasn't a big deal, just telling him stuff like \"sorry, my bad\" (although I knew I didn't have to be sorry for anything). He was probably expecting a fight or some sort of panic reaction from me, but since things didn't go like that he couldn't say anything, he only stared at me for some more seconds and told me to leave quickly. I left then and told the police everything. \n","Mental Issue: ptsd\n","Wellbeing Insight: Based on the text, the individual exhibits symptoms consistent with PTSD following a traumatic incident involving gun violence.\n","\n","**Ryff Scale Insights:**\n","\n","*   **Autonomy:** Seek control in safe environments.

The challenges I’m facing of not letting my frustrations out on people who don’t deserve it ie doctors (I had a bad experience when I was 12 in the hospital for a week or so as well as experiencing some issues imo with standard of care) \n","\n","I finally did a few things for myself regarding relationships with other people and it has helped lift some weight I didn’t know I had. I’ve been by exes therapist for a few years after our splitting ways, we both genuinely cared about each other and kept in touch frequently. If she was ever in a relationship I’d never call out of respect for the other guy. All that being said this past week I just didn’t want to do it anymore, to me it is so frustrating to watch someone suffer when they don’t have to especially when I am doing it practically 24/7 and would do anything to get back to a different time. I told her how I felt about her abusive bf, how I felt about her, and how she was better than this situation and that she needs to start respecting herself if she wants to stay in touch. Not as a way of getting her back, but as a way of setting a boundary. As I said I can’t stand to be around people who subject themselves to pain and suffering. It’s a long story and I know abuse is not to be taken lightly often those relationships are the hardest to leave, this being said she has so many people that would drop everything for her to help her get out of this. They’ve not been together to long and I told her time is of the essence the longer she waits the harder it will be. The last thing she said to me prior to me dropping a bomb on her (metaphorically cmon guys) was NOOOO jk jk she said not to call and just say okay right after we got off the phone and she brought up old times of us being together. Well she didn’t say that she had her mom text me that. (Also I live states away otherwise I’d interject myself) \n","\n","Anyways that’s the tip of the iceberg.

It’s given me someone to look at and base my actions off of. Helpful to me because I am like a blank slate some days as far as how to function as a human being. Right from wrong, not in a drastic way but my compass is slightly warped. \n","\n","Online support groups- regarding the chronic pain specifically I spoke with other people going through similar experiences. Being able to speak freely in the comfort of other people while also using the things you’ve learned to help others is such a great positive cycle to be a part of.  I encourage everyone if they have the confidence to do so that you find a support group for a problem you have and see what it can do for you. \n","\n","On a positive note I’ve removed enough of my bad habits to actually be able and enjoy a good one! I’m slowly getting into making music and trying my best to fall in love every step of the way. I’ve always wanted to but that voice in my head told me it was a waste of time and I shouldn’t bother since it won’t go anywhere. No more. I hope to continue and be able to see through the veil that is my perception. \n","\n","To anyone currently going through something they can’t see themselves getting out of, I promise there’s someone who can help you. There is an answer in the right direction out there for you.

He felt well enough to go to school for 2 days and now he’s complaining of a headache again and has a low grade fever again. He’s acting normal, just says he’s tired. My neighbors kids had the same thing last week (headaches and fevers that lasted a few days) so that’s reassuring but I can’t keep myself from googling. I haven’t slept in days. I’m worried sick. This happens every single time one of my children isn’t 100%. I think what triggered it was when my daughter (barely two at the time) had salmonella and it transferred to her blood stream. We were admitted to the hospital for several days and she responded quickly to treatment.
