## Abstract

This project leverages artificial intelligence to detect early signs of mental health issues by analyzing multimodal data from social media platforms. By processing text, images, videos, audio, and PDFs, the system uses advanced machine learning and deep learning models to classify mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and PTSD. The framework also generates personalized wellbeing insights by mapping mental health cues to Ryff‚Äôs Wellbeing Scale. With an ensemble of algorithms‚Äîincluding Logistic Regression, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, LSTM, Transformer, and XGBoost‚Äîthe system achieves high accuracy and robustness while enabling real-time web-based analysis via Streamlit.

## Features

- üîç **Multimodal Analysis:** Processes text, images, videos, audio, and PDFs.
- üìä **Data-Driven Insights:** Uses ensemble learning for robust classification.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced Preprocessing:** Cleans and tokenizes raw social media data.
- üß† **Diverse ML Models:** Implements Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- ü§ñ **Deep Learning Models:** LSTM-based and Transformer-based models for sequential and contextual data.
- üåê **Web Application:** Deployable via Streamlit for real-time analysis.
- üìà **Performance Evaluation:** Extensive testing with cross-validation, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.
- üìã **Wellbeing Mapping:** Uses an association matrix and a brief wellbeing survey to map predictions to Ryff‚Äôs Psychological Wellbeing dimensions. It highlights areas (e.g., purpose, autonomy) users should focus on.
- üß† **AI-Powered Wellbeing Insights:** Uses Gemini API to generate personalized wellbeing insights based on predictions.
- üîÅ **RAG-Style Insights:** Employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation using dynamic datasets and similarity-based input matching‚Äîwith Gemini‚Äîfor scalable and explainable wellbeing analysis.
