# Multimodal AI Framework for Social Media Based Mental Disorder Detection and Personalized Wellbeing Insights

---

## Abstract

This project leverages artificial intelligence to detect early signs of mental health issues by analyzing multimodal data from social media platforms. By processing text, images, videos, audio, and PDFs, the system uses advanced machine learning and deep learning models to classify mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and PTSD. The framework also generates personalized wellbeing insights by mapping mental health cues to Ryff’s Wellbeing Scale. With an ensemble of algorithms—including Logistic Regression, SVM, Naïve Bayes, LSTM, Transformer, and XGBoost—the system achieves high accuracy and robustness while enabling real-time web-based analysis via Streamlit.
