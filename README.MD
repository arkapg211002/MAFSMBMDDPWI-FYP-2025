# Multimodal AI Framework for Social Media Based Mental Disorder Detection and Personalized Wellbeing Insights

---

## Abstract

This project leverages artificial intelligence to detect early signs of mental health issues by analyzing multimodal data from social media platforms. By processing text, images, videos, audio, and PDFs, the system uses advanced machine learning and deep learning models to classify mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and PTSD. The framework also generates personalized wellbeing insights by mapping mental health cues to Ryff‚Äôs Wellbeing Scale. With an ensemble of algorithms‚Äîincluding Logistic Regression, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, LSTM, Transformer, and XGBoost‚Äîthe system achieves high accuracy and robustness while enabling real-time web-based analysis via Streamlit.


## Introduction

Social media platforms have become a mirror reflecting the mental state of their users. This project addresses the challenge of detecting mental disorders early by analyzing posts and multimedia content on platforms such as Reddit and Twitter. The multimodal approach integrates:

- **Text Analysis:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment and context analysis.
- **Image Analysis:** Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and facial emotion detection.
- **Video & Audio Analysis:** Extraction of frames and mood analysis via audio features.
- **PDF Analysis:** Text extraction from documents for mental health cue detection.

By combining traditional machine learning with modern deep learning techniques, the system provides accurate classification and actionable wellbeing insights.
