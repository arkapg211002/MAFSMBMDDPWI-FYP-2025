I see a lonely house perched on the edge of a cliff, isolated and weathered. Below, a dark and empty beach stretches out under a sky filled with heavy, ominous clouds. A twisted tree with sparse, drooping branches stands near the shore, struggling to survive.

It evokes feelings of isolation, sadness, and emptiness. The house seems abandoned, the tree looks tired, and the whole scene carries a weight of loneliness—like being stuck in a place where no one can reach you.

Yes, it reminds me of moments when I felt distant from everything, like I was standing alone while the rest of the world moved on. The waves keep coming, but they don’t change anything—the feeling of being stuck remains.

It would be about someone who lives in that house, disconnected from the world, watching the ocean but never stepping forward. The tree mirrors their struggle—still standing, but barely holding on. Over time, the cliff might crumble, just as the weight of isolation wears them down.

The waves will keep washing the shore, the wind will keep bending the tree, and the house will keep decaying. But the sense of solitude won’t fade—if anything, it might deepen, as time passes and nothing truly changes.
