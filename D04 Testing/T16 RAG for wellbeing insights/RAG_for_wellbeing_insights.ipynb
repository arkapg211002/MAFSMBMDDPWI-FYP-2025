I’ve only ever had it as an extreme anxiety or panic attack, and then when it’s over, the anxiety slowly calms down over the course of about a month. But two months ago I started having “normal” anxiety. I it started as a day long anxiety attack, and then it calmed down. Or so I thought, cause 2 months later I’m still anxious and I’m so confused and scared. I’ve had my blood work done to check if there’s anything wrong. I had low b-12 levels, and also folate deficiency which can cause anxiety, but after a few weeks of supplementing the anxiety is still here and it’s scaring me to think that this may never pass. I’m not used to this. I had a panic attack a few days ago, the first since I was a teenager, and I’m so so so so fucking scared. (I categorize anxiety attacks and panic attacks as two different things. Anxiety attacks feels like panic attacks, but lasts multiple days. Panic attacks lasts a couple of hours) I’ve always said that I’d sacrifice every limb of my body if it meant I’d never experience anxiety again. I’d rather be chronically physically ill forever than live with anxiety. And now I’m anxious every day. I’m so scared that I’ve developed generalized anxiety disorder. I can’t live like this.

            "Text: Need advice on chronic procrastination  Hi there! I’m looking for advice or to know your experiences with procrastinating because of being so overwhelmed with having a noisy head while trying to work on anything. People often say: don’t think just do it/ 5 seconds rule/ start and you’ll build momentum/ eat the frog/ quit the illusion of perfectionism/ use the pomodoro  technique. While all these are great suggestions, they still don’t work for me because my problem is the inability to focus on the task from the non-stop fearful thoughts. It feels like multitasking between working on the task and trying to quiet my brain or respond to the persistent anxious thoughts (which a lot of the time sound rational and worthy of attention so, I always fall for it). My fear response slows me down so much, I don’t know what to do about it!! All of this creates quite a stressful, resulting in a feedback loop that makes me chronically procrastinate and conclude that I’m incompetent. I’ve been like this for many years and it’s starting to get worse. Nothing has worked. Body doubling helps only a little and not all the time. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and CPTSD and have been doing therapy and taking meds for many years yet. I haven’t gotten any better with procrastination and I’ve been so frustrated about it all, to the point that I’ve gotten depressed because I continue to resent myself for being incompetent. \n",

None of them speak English very well. My stepmom, stepbrother, and 3 year old baby brother all moved to America a little over a year ago. My dad owns a trailer that he’s lived in for the past 11 years in the suburbs of Chicago. My stepmom knew this before we began the paperwork process to bring them over here. Everything was normal and peaceful the entire time they’ve been here until one day in February or March when the power went out in the trailer because of a storm. It came back on the next day, but my stepmom says that’s when the fear started.\n",
            "\n",
            "Flash forward to September when I moved out, she started experiencing panic attacks, crying, losing her appetite whenever there is even just wind sounds outside. She checks the weather everyday and at has even left the trailer with the kids in the middle of the day a couple of times. She doesn’t know how to drive and doesn’t speak english. On one occasion, she asked the neighbor if she could pay him to drop them off at Walmart and she stayed there with all the kids for the entire day until my dad got out of work and picked them up. Now she asks my dad to book a hotel room for a day so that she can stay there with the kids because there’s a forecast of bad weather tomorrow. My stepbrother has missed a lot of school because he’s staying at home with her.\n",

The psychiatrist prescribed her trazadone, setraline, and most recently hydroxyzine. I sent her over a list of therapist who she can set up an appointment with to start counseling but I don’t think she’s called anyone. Her symptoms don’t seem to be getting better and my dad doesn’t know what else to do. All she says is that she’s scared to live in the trailer. He’s now selling the trailer and plans to move into a more expensive apartment for nearby so that she can be calm and so that their lives go back to normal, but they’re waiting on the apartment application to be processed. In the meantime, things don’t seem to be getting better and this problem has turned their entire lives upside down. My stepmom says that when she’s in a solid building she feels much better and doesn’t experience any panic attacks, but that in the trailer her heart races and she feels like she can’t breathe and she’s just really afraid. My dad can’t afford to keep booking them hotel rooms and he is threatening that if these problems don’t stop after they move into the apartment then there’s nothing more he can do. At night she cries a lot and that prevents him from being able to sleep and he has to get up for work at 4 am each day. He took a whole week off work last week to try to tackle this problem, I also went over there for a few days to help since I speak spanish. That’s when we found the apartment and filled out all the paperwork and stuff.

My current fixation is accidentally getting high, I used to be a stoner, I did acid once and shrooms twice and dabbled in pills, I never had a bad experience visually but the last time I smoked and did shrooms it triggered internee panic and then I was fine when I sobered up, I didn’t see anything scary but I just wasn’t ok. My problem is I get overstimmed really easily, by lights, noises, complex thought(shit like math) and it’s getting worse and it is when I get overstimulated my first thought goes to youre high, yours having a bad experiencing you’re having bad trip AND I DONT MNOW WHY.

I’ve been battling anxiety for 3 years now since college, and while I’ve made progress, I’m not so sure I have. I was put on medicine and took myself off (wasn’t smart), but as soon as I started my first job, it came back. I tried to wean myself off again, and it wasn’t working. I started seeing a psychiatrist this past September. He’s been great and for several months I felt great. It wasn’t until after I sat for a CPA Exam that i started to feel anxiety again for a few weeks. Perhaps I was awaiting the score, but all went well. A week later, the pandemic and quarantine started around St Pattys Day. Pretty much since then, I’ve been on and off. One good week, one off week. Two good weeks, one off week. And I don’t even know if off is the right word. It doesn’t last the whole week or even a whole day, but it’s this constant monitoring to see if I’m anxious and how I feel. My anxiety has become this general feeling of uneasiness and worry with constant rumination. When I feel good, things are rolling along and I can’t understand how I get caught in my web of anxiety. However, on the flip side, once I’m caught, it feels as though I’ll never get out (even though I always do and I know there is no danger). So I don’t even know if I’m technically experiencing anxiety at this point, or I’m psyching myself out due to fear and the past. Isn’t it bad that in the fall I went months feeling good and now I’m on and off all of a sudden? My doctor is contemplating putting me on 40mg, but wants to see what happens after lockdown. He says everyone is struggling right now, which I get. I’m extremely analytical and my worse fear is this lasting forever. I even see posts I made a year ago asking questions regarding anxiety, so it seems I’m in the same spot. My anxiety used to be panic attacks but now it is the symptoms I described. I exercise, I’ve read books on it, but it always comes back. I don’t wanna go on more medicine because I want to get off it one day. If it’s necessary I guess I don’t have a choice. How can I keep getting caught in the same trap every other damn week? Is there something wrong with me? Sorry for the long post, but can anyone give an opinion/advice/help? I have so many good things going on in my life, I hate this. I feel so close to breaking through as well, but then so far.\n",

I don't know when it started just because for the longest time, I thought it was the norm. My deepest point was when I graduated highschool. That is when I had suicidal thoughts... Sometimes i would try to commit suicide but ending up not doing it anyway as thinking about death also triggers my anxiety. And me already having a grasp of what was happening to me probably helps, as at those times I already have done my research about depression, anxiety, suicidal and such. I have a better understanding of my situation and can make myself calm by doing things that are right like postponing it(basically telling myself if i want to commit suicide, I have to do it tomorrow) which basically will not happen anyway as i will experience a whole different kind of emotion at that time. It's just that when i tell someone about my anxiety and depression i have been through, i feel like i can't tell them that I'm also suicidal as I never did it anyway, as I was afraid of doing it anyway, so I feel like they were invalid.

It started a year ago when I was working as a waitress. I would get super dizzy nauseous and my heart would start racing. I thought it happened because I had a high stress job but I started to feel the symptoms out of work at stores, family events, driving, being alone in public etc. I got to the point where I started to isolate myself from everything. \n",
            "       I quit my job and made my boyfriend go into stores for me and getting takeout. He came and sat in the parking lot while I was in classes. Since then I’ve been seeing a therapist and taking buspar and propranolol. I’ve been pretty good about going into stores now with my boyfriend and I can go into gas stations sometimes if I’m feeling good. I just think I’m at the point where I want to hang with my friends and they kind of understand how I’m feeling but I’m nervous to spend time with them without my boyfriend or go and do anything without him for that matter. My therapist wants me to get out of my comfort zone and try to do things on my own but I get panic attacks. \n",
            "    I get a light headed heart racing feeling when I drive so I always worry about that happening. It’s the scariest experience. I vape which I know doesn’t help it but does anyone have any advice on how I can break out of my shell and become more social again? I get nervous getting to my destination but once I’m there I’m “ok”.  I just want to be “normal” again.\n",

Friend of mine (F/20) is constantly worrying (sometimes to the point of feeling physically sick) about everything in her life that could go wrong but will never really happen if you think about it, e.g. she worries she'll get breast cancer, that she won't get married, that she won't pass law exams that she cannot do until we finish our undergrad degree (at least two and a half years away) and these are exams that she doesn't even think she will do because she doesn't actually want to be a lawyer. She constantly puts herself down and says she's not good at things that from an outside perspective (other people, not me because I know she actually feels like this) seems like she's just looking for validation because it's obvious to everyone but her that she is actually good at it, e.g. she is currently ranked second in our class but constantly says she is no good at academic stuff. She has broken down in tears multiple times this year over the stress she feels and her feelings of being overwhelmed, and I honestly cannot deal with it any more. It feels like our whole relationship has become about her feelings of worry but she won't do anything about it. I've asked her multiple times if she would consider going to talk to a counsellor (she never has and she has never been formally diagnosed with anxiety, and I know I probably shouldn't do this but I do think she suffers from it) I've told her I'm worried about her, I've told her that at one point I considered calling her mom to help me get through to her because I was so worried. It feels like I'm talking to a literal brick wall and that nothing is going through. It makes me feel useless, and I'm getting to the stage where I've stopped telling her constantly that she is good at stuff, etc. because she's just not listening. I'm beginning to feel annoyed every time she puts herself down and I'm really trying not to but it's really hard to keep propping someone else's self-esteem up. Don't get me wrong I love this girl, she's practically my best friend but recently the relationship has been exhausting and I don't know how I can get through to her. Any advice would be welcome.\n",

I had derealization 24/7 for 9-10 months but have snapped out of it, still get feelings of unreality on some days but it's not where near as bad. My main concern is that I am paranoid of being paranoid and it scares me so much. Ever since I was robbed I became mistrusting of people and when I was attacked I had a panic attack which put me in a sever state of depersonalization. Since then I began researching symptoms of schitzophrenia and is something I dwell on 24/7 it's always on the back of my mind. The biggest problem is that whenever I see something, I.e a person in a suit with a suitcase, if it resembles what you'd see in a movie, the person looking like an agent, I start to ecesssively think about why I though that and end up worrying about it all day. But at the time it happens it feels so real like I feel fear inside of me and am terrified. I am extremely scared of going insane and losing touch with reality. I also think I could have some ptsd as am very jumpy but I don't have any nightmares or flashbacks. It has sort of become an obsession. Whenever I get a depersonalization attack it makes me feel that everything around me is fake and this puts a seed of strong fear in me which makes me freak out and worry that am being paranoid and that eventually It's going to turn into a full blown phsycosis. I spoke to phsyciatrist as over 8 months ago and they were consistent in telling me it is not schitzophrenia. What worries me the most is the overwhelming feelings of paranoi that I get or is it the anxiety and fear that I feel. I don't believe the paranoia and know it's irrational but it just feels so real in the moment. Please could someone help. I am going to see a phsyc again and am not looking for reassurance but am really scared so if anyone can help at all. Is paranoia like this common with depersonalization? \n",

My anxiety surges in amazing highs and lows, where one day I think I’m the best contender for Prime Minister, and the next I think I’ll be a crack head for the rest of my life. My therapist thinks my anxiety is chronic, and that I was probably born with it or developed it in early childhood. The psychiatrist said that while I definitely met the standards for having GAD, my level of day-to-day functioning does “not require intervention on our part.” Basically, he said I didn’t need any drugs, and that if I wanted to, I didn’t even have to keep seeing my therapist anymore. \n",

I mean as in the daily anxiety feeling that lingers. I’ve only ever had it as an extreme anxiety or panic attack, and then when it’s over, the anxiety slowly calms down over the course of about a month. But two months ago I started having “normal” anxiety. I it started as a day long anxiety attack, and then it calmed down. Or so I thought, cause 2 months later I’m still anxious and I’m so confused and scared. I’ve had my blood work done to check if there’s anything wrong. I had low b-12 levels, and also folate deficiency which can cause anxiety, but after a few weeks of supplementing the anxiety is still here and it’s scaring me to think that this may never pass. I’m not used to this. I had a panic attack a few days ago, the first since I was a teenager, and I’m so so so so fucking scared. (I categorize anxiety attacks and panic attacks as two different things. Anxiety attacks feels like panic attacks, but lasts multiple days. Panic attacks lasts a couple of hours) I’ve always said that I’d sacrifice every limb of my body if it meant I’d never experience anxiety again. I’d rather be chronically physically ill forever than live with anxiety. And now I’m anxious every day. I’m so scared that I’ve developed generalized anxiety disorder. I can’t live like this.

I don't know when it started just because for the longest time, I thought it was the norm. My deepest point was when I graduated highschool. That is when I had suicidal thoughts... Sometimes i would try to commit suicide but ending up not doing it anyway as thinking about death also triggers my anxiety. And me already having a grasp of what was happening to me probably helps, as at those times I already have done my research about depression, anxiety, suicidal and such. I have a better understanding of my situation and can make myself calm by doing things that are right like postponing it(basically telling myself if i want to commit suicide, I have to do it tomorrow) which basically will not happen anyway as i will experience a whole different kind of emotion at that time. It's just that when i tell someone about my anxiety and depression i have been through, i feel like i can't tell them that I'm also suicidal as I never did it anyway, as I was afraid of doing it anyway, so I feel like they were invalid.

Basically if your anxiety worries you then it’s a disorder but if it doesn’t (maybe you’re just trying to live with it) it’s not a disorder. Is this true?

            "Text: Do I have GAD? I don’t know if I’m making progress please help. I just don’t understand where I’m at. I’ve been battling anxiety for 3 years now since college, and while I’ve made progress, I’m not so sure I have. I was put on medicine and took myself off (wasn’t smart), but as soon as I started my first job, it came back. I tried to wean myself off again, and it wasn’t working. I started seeing a psychiatrist this past September. He’s been great and for several months I felt great. It wasn’t until after I sat for a CPA Exam that i started to feel anxiety again for a few weeks. Perhaps I was awaiting the score, but all went well. A week later, the pandemic and quarantine started around St Pattys Day. Pretty much since then, I’ve been on and off. One good week, one off week. Two good weeks, one off week. And I don’t even know if off is the right word. It doesn’t last the whole week or even a whole day, but it’s this constant monitoring to see if I’m anxious and how I feel. My anxiety has become this general feeling of uneasiness and worry with constant rumination. When I feel good, things are rolling along and I can’t understand how I get caught in my web of anxiety. However, on the flip side, once I’m caught, it feels as though I’ll never get out (even though I always do and I know there is no danger). So I don’t even know if I’m technically experiencing anxiety at this point, or I’m psyching myself out due to fear and the past. Isn’t it bad that in the fall I went months feeling good and now I’m on and off all of a sudden? My doctor is contemplating putting me on 40mg, but wants to see what happens after lockdown. He says everyone is struggling right now, which I get. I’m extremely analytical and my worse fear is this lasting forever. I even see posts I made a year ago asking questions regarding anxiety, so it seems I’m in the same spot. My anxiety used to be panic attacks but now it is the symptoms I described. I exercise, I’ve read books on it, but it always comes back. I don’t wanna go on more medicine because I want to get off it one day. If it’s necessary I guess I don’t have a choice. How can I keep getting caught in the same trap every other damn week? Is there something wrong with me? Sorry for the long post, but can anyone give an opinion/advice/help? I have so many good things going on in my life, I hate this. I feel so close to breaking through as well, but then so far.\n",

It started a year ago when I was working as a waitress. I would get super dizzy nauseous and my heart would start racing. I thought it happened because I had a high stress job but I started to feel the symptoms out of work at stores, family events, driving, being alone in public etc. I got to the point where I started to isolate myself from everything. \n",

Since then I’ve been seeing a therapist and taking buspar and propranolol. I’ve been pretty good about going into stores now with my boyfriend and I can go into gas stations sometimes if I’m feeling good. I just think I’m at the point where I want to hang with my friends and they kind of understand how I’m feeling but I’m nervous to spend time with them without my boyfriend or go and do anything without him for that matter. My therapist wants me to get out of my comfort zone and try to do things on my own but I get panic attacks. \n",

I had some stronger pill on the second night but it didn't do anything. 3,8mg of melatonin last night didn't seem to work either. After 22 hours I'll be able to call into my employer and probably get someone to talk to, and hopefully a medication that would stop this particular attack. I already learned how to cope with this and what works for me and what doesn't. I'm mentally in a good state most of the time but my body won't let it go.

            "Text: Need advice on chronic procrastination  Hi there! I’m looking for advice or to know your experiences with procrastinating because of being so overwhelmed with having a noisy head while trying to work on anything. People often say: don’t think just do it/ 5 seconds rule/ start and you’ll build momentum/ eat the frog/ quit the illusion of perfectionism/ use the pomodoro  technique. While all these are great suggestions, they still don’t work for me because my problem is the inability to focus on the task from the non-stop fearful thoughts. It feels like multitasking between working on the task and trying to quiet my brain or respond to the persistent anxious thoughts (which a lot of the time sound rational and worthy of attention so, I always fall for it). My fear response slows me down so much, I don’t know what to do about it!! All of this creates quite a stressful, resulting in a feedback loop that makes me chronically procrastinate and conclude that I’m incompetent. I’ve been like this for many years and it’s starting to get worse. Nothing has worked. Body doubling helps only a little and not all the time. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and CPTSD and have been doing therapy and taking meds for many years yet. I haven’t gotten any better with procrastination and I’ve been so frustrated about it all, to the point that I’ve gotten depressed because I continue to resent myself for being incompetent. \n",

None of them speak English very well. My stepmom, stepbrother, and 3 year old baby brother all moved to America a little over a year ago. My dad owns a trailer that he’s lived in for the past 11 years in the suburbs of Chicago. My stepmom knew this before we began the paperwork process to bring them over here. Everything was normal and peaceful the entire time they’ve been here until one day in February or March when the power went out in the trailer because of a storm. It came back on the next day, but my stepmom says that’s when the fear started.\n",
            "\n",
            "Flash forward to September when I moved out, she started experiencing panic attacks, crying, losing her appetite whenever there is even just wind sounds outside. She checks the weather everyday and at has even left the trailer with the kids in the middle of the day a couple of times. She doesn’t know how to drive and doesn’t speak english. On one occasion, she asked the neighbor if she could pay him to drop them off at Walmart and she stayed there with all the kids for the entire day until my dad got out of work and picked them up. Now she asks my dad to book a hotel room for a day so that she can stay there with the kids because there’s a forecast of bad weather tomorrow. My stepbrother has missed a lot of school because he’s staying at home with her.\n",

The psychiatrist prescribed her trazadone, setraline, and most recently hydroxyzine. I sent her over a list of therapist who she can set up an appointment with to start counseling but I don’t think she’s called anyone. Her symptoms don’t seem to be getting better and my dad doesn’t know what else to do. All she says is that she’s scared to live in the trailer. He’s now selling the trailer and plans to move into a more expensive apartment for nearby so that she can be calm and so that their lives go back to normal, but they’re waiting on the apartment application to be processed. In the meantime, things don’t seem to be getting better and this problem has turned their entire lives upside down. My stepmom says that when she’s in a solid building she feels much better and doesn’t experience any panic attacks, but that in the trailer her heart races and she feels like she can’t breathe and she’s just really afraid. My dad can’t afford to keep booking them hotel rooms and he is threatening that if these problems don’t stop after they move into the apartment then there’s nothing more he can do. At night she cries a lot and that prevents him from being able to sleep and he has to get up for work at 4 am each day. He took a whole week off work last week to try to tackle this problem, I also went over there for a few days to help since I speak spanish. That’s when we found the apartment and filled out all the paperwork and stuff. Originally the plan was to take her to the ER, but the psychiatrist advised against that unless she is in the middle of a panic attack.\n",

My problem is I get overstimmed really easily, by lights, noises, complex thought(shit like math) and it’s getting worse and it is when I get overstimulated my first thought goes to youre high, yours having a bad experiencing you’re having bad trip AND I DONT MNOW WHY. I don’t feel that way AT ALL but my brain tries to convince me like this is the day. And it does this on and off like I’ll be fine for weeks then for like days straight it’s every time I get overstimulated my brain goes to that. I have ADD so I get overstimmed alooot and i will keep getting over stimmed and I know that. I also have been scared to use cups, drink and eat cause my brain is like it’s laced WHEN I LNOW ITS NOT I KNOW ITS NOT!

Friend of mine (F/20) is constantly worrying (sometimes to the point of feeling physically sick) about everything in her life that could go wrong but will never really happen if you think about it, e.g. she worries she'll get breast cancer, that she won't get married, that she won't pass law exams that she cannot do until we finish our undergrad degree (at least two and a half years away) and these are exams that she doesn't even think she will do because she doesn't actually want to be a lawyer. She constantly puts herself down and says she's not good at things that from an outside perspective (other people, not me because I know she actually feels like this) seems like she's just looking for validation because it's obvious to everyone but her that she is actually good at it, e.g. she is currently ranked second in our class but constantly says she is no good at academic stuff. She has broken down in tears multiple times this year over the stress she feels and her feelings of being overwhelmed, and I honestly cannot deal with it any more. It feels like our whole relationship has become about her feelings of worry but she won't do anything about it. I've asked her multiple times if she would consider going to talk to a counsellor (she never has and she has never been formally diagnosed with anxiety, and I know I probably shouldn't do this but I do think she suffers from it) I've told her I'm worried about her, I've told her that at one point I considered calling her mom to help me get through to her because I was so worried. It feels like I'm talking to a literal brick wall and that nothing is going through. It makes me feel useless, and I'm getting to the stage where I've stopped telling her constantly that she is good at stuff, etc. because she's just not listening. I'm beginning to feel annoyed every time she puts herself down and I'm really trying not to but it's really hard to keep propping someone else's self-esteem up. Don't get me wrong I love this girl, she's practically my best friend but recently the relationship has been exhausting and I don't know how I can get through to her. Any advice would be welcome.\n",

            "Text: Intensely scared I have schitziohrenia I am intensely worried and have convinced myself that I have schitzophrenia. I had derealization 24/7 for 9-10 months but have snapped out of it, still get feelings of unreality on some days but it's not where near as bad. My main concern is that I am paranoid of being paranoid and it scares me so much. Ever since I was robbed I became mistrusting of people and when I was attacked I had a panic attack which put me in a sever state of depersonalization. Since then I began researching symptoms of schitzophrenia and is something I dwell on 24/7 it's always on the back of my mind. The biggest problem is that whenever I see something, I.e a person in a suit with a suitcase, if it resembles what you'd see in a movie, the person looking like an agent, I start to ecesssively think about why I though that and end up worrying about it all day. But at the time it happens it feels so real like I feel fear inside of me and am terrified. I am extremely scared of going insane and losing touch with reality. I also think I could have some ptsd as am very jumpy but I don't have any nightmares or flashbacks. It has sort of become an obsession. Whenever I get a depersonalization attack it makes me feel that everything around me is fake and this puts a seed of strong fear in me which makes me freak out and worry that am being paranoid and that eventually It's going to turn into a full blown phsycosis. I spoke to phsyciatrist as over 8 months ago and they were consistent in telling me it is not schitzophrenia. What worries me the most is the overwhelming feelings of paranoi that I get or is it the anxiety and fear that I feel. I don't believe the paranoia and know it's irrational but it just feels so real in the moment. Please could someone help. I am going to see a phsyc again and am not looking for reassurance but am really scared so if anyone can help at all. Is paranoia like this common with depersonalization? \n",

            "Text: Ridiculous insecurity postpartum/need help and advice Hi friends - I gave birth to twins (my first kids) 8 months ago and it has been extremely difficult, and that is an understatement. I have anxiety at baseline, but postpartum has amplified that 100-fold. They were conceived naturally, and it was an absolute shock when we found out at my first ultrasound. I have been struggling badly through PPD, PPA, and extremely crippling insecurity, and I'm not sure how to navigate this (I do have a therapist, she is somewhat helpful).\n",
            "\n",
            "Mainly, I am going through insane insecurity, specifically around my husband. The thought of him with other women makes me want to crawl out of my skin. I always had a level of being territorial in the past, but it was not excessive, more of like a \"this is my man\" but now, it gives me immense distress to picture him with anyone else. He is a good man and has not given me a reason to suspect that he's doing anything behind my back. The main thing that happened was that he went to a strip club on a bachelor party when I was pregnant (it was planned before I got pregnant, I was very newly pregnant when he went, and I told him he could go to the party since it had already been planned). In the past I was never bothered by strip clubs (I realize everyone has very different views on this and I respect them all) but after he came back and told me about it, I lost my shit and in postpartum it has become so much worse, like intrusive images of him with the stripper who he got lap dances from, picturing him in a very intimate situation with her, etc. I'm sure this event has augmented the insecurity and my hormones are not helping at all. He was very apologetic and has expressed a lot of remorse, not thinking it would affect me the way it did (I also did not think it would mess with me like it did). Really just looking for advice on how I can stifle this insecurity because it has gotten very bad. I haven't been able to lose the last 20 lbs I want to lose to get back to my pre-pregnancy body, and my c section scar just bothers the shit out of me whenever I see it. I just feel so broken now, I used to be so much more confident, excited for life, loved going out with friends and dressing up and I always kinda knew I was out of my husband's league (he has told me that before), and now I feel like a shell of my former self and sometimes with all the overwhelm of my life, I feel like its not really worth living anymore.\n",

It didn’t impact my sleep to this extent last time and I feel like my brain just panics all night because now I have this little baby to take care of and if I’m not sleeping I’ll start to lose it.

It makes me angry and then he gets upset that I’m upset which I hate. Anyways, that’s the level we’re on right now.

            "Text: New mom anxiety I feel like my inlaws don't respect me. I went through hell bringing my baby into the world and almost died due to malpractice bleeding out 3x my total volume.  And now I have bad ppd and ppa. Anytime I start telling my story to them they hardly listen and they change the topic. They are topically positive, in my opinion. Sometimes negative things meed to be discussed.  I feel like they really don't care mich about what I went through and they just want to hog my baby. They are from another state across the country so I get they want to soak up baby time. But when she cries instead of bringing her to me they try to fix her up themselves and tell me \"she's fine \".  She isn't fine. That's her hunger cry...or her diaper cry...or her tired cry.  So when I tell them gently, she needs a new diaper they don't belive me and continue singing to her and walking her up and down the halls.  I corrected them when they fell asleep with her on the couch and when they tried holding her up high on a bar chair and I said please don't do that it could end badly and it gives me anxiety. They say she's fine. I'm like no please listen. Finally I cried to my hubby and he finally listened. I was seperate from my baby for a few days in the hospital while I was dying and then for weeks after I needed a lot of help with caring for her. So now that I can be the mom I want my baby to know I'm the mom and I don't want others trying to replace me. For instance when she fussed they wanted me to get them a bottle so they could feed her...but I said no I'm trying to only nurse her and use bottles for if I have to leave for an appointment or if I need a nap. For the most part she never gets bottles.  They acted like that's rediculous. But it's really hard to breast deed and latch her right now. She's 3 months and has regressed back to nipple shields which are a pain in the ass. I just want one thing to be natural and promote bonding so I'm really serious about breast feeding her.  It's going well till others try to tell me what to do. I was putting her in her carseat and FIL would not stop trying to help buckle after I said repeatedly that I got it.  Like when I'm caring for my baby as the mom, keep away and let me be. I don't need advice or help if I'm not asking for it.  I am very maternal and have been a nurse for over 8 years with lots of peds and neo experience, plus I grew up baby sitting human babies and had a farm full of baby animals that I took care of and bottle fed PLUS I read a bunch of baby books throughout pregnancy. I do well with her and I don't need outdated advice. They used to keep my husband in a seperate room so he could cry and they could sleep AS A NEWBORN!\n",

I told him that I actually enjoyed picking out my daughters Christmas dress online. Then I said 'I am starting to get irritated with your criticism and comparisons, it's annoying'.

I ended up needing an emergency c-section due to my baby not getting enough oxygen as I was having contractions. Then, I spent a week in the hospital with Postpartum preeclampsia. Now, my colostrum is drying up despite me trying every way to stimulate my nipples, pump, and latch my baby on and my milk hasn’t come in. I can’t even hand express more than a dribble. It’s been a week since she was born. I’ve had to formula feed because she had lost 9% of her body weight 3 days after birth and was jaundice. I know a fed baby is a healthy baby but I was so set on breastfeeding and I feel like a failure. I talked to my OB about it today and she was going to prescribe me a medication to help my milk come in. Well, she called me later and said that I actually can’t take it because it’s the ONE medication that I’m allergic to. I feel absolutely defeated. My baby spent around 6 hours in the NICU due to not transitioning well and she needed oxygen and a feeding tube so I didn’t get a chance to do skin to skin bonding with her after delivery. Because I was recovering from my c-section and then the preeclampsia I wasn’t able to take care of my baby like a mother should and my husband and our family did almost all of the feedings, changing her, and holding her. I feel like she doesn’t have the connection to me that everyone talks about having with their baby. It feels like she likes everyone else more than me. I have extremely bad Postpartum Anxiety and I haven’t slept more than a couple of hours in a week because I feel like if I fall asleep something bad will happen to her. I try to sleep and I just wake up with an impeding doom feeling and have to stare at her and watch her breathe so I know she’s okay. I can’t handle it. I have extremely deep stretch marks all over my stomach and an apron belly now. I hate how my body looks. I feel like it’s failed me in every aspect. I don’t know what I’m seeking from posting this but I just had to get it all out… I know I should just be happy that I “gave birth” to a beautiful baby girl. She’s absolutely perfect and I’m so in love with her. But, I can’t shake the feelings I’m having. Can anyone relate? Sorry for the long rant. I’m just really struggling.\n",

It was terrifying, but I thought I’d get a break afterward and finally focus on enjoying my time with my son. Instead, my son caught Covid, and we spent Christmas in the hospital—on the same ward where I had been treated for postpartum hypertension. That period was traumatizing, especially as it coincided with the first anniversary of my mom’s passing.\n",

            "When my son was five months old, I went to the ER for palpitations (likely a panic attack) and a spot was found on my lung. The waiting and testing that followed pushed my nervous system into overdrive. I was convinced I had cancer—every new sensation in my body felt like confirmation of it. I was at the ER so often, terrified I had something like a brain tumor or metastasis. Thankfully, the spot turned out to be benign, but it was rare and required surgery in late June to remove part of my lung. Now I have to go for regular follow-ups, and the scan anxiety has been debilitating. My mom’s experience with metastatic breast cancer only fuels my fears.\n",

So i had my baby in March and i am currently 8 months postpartum, everything seemed completely fine this entire time up until 2 weeks ago i noticed i’ve been having a ton of anxiety. I usually never feel anxious or have panic attacks, so this is out of the ordinary for me. Like ill be sitting there and randomly get waves of anxiety and have a panic attack. Or if something’s going on with my physically that really seems to make me very anxious. Ive caught a cold, gotten a uti, and stomachache and those literally made me spiral into a panic for no reason. Id say maybe feeling some health anxiety. Or anytime ive eaten the past few weeks, once im done and full itll trigger a ton of anxiety in me. Not in an eating disorder kind of way, ill randomly just get extremely anxious after eating and not sure why. My husband said maybe i developed diabetes while being postpartum since i feel panicky after eating but that doesnt seem to make sense. Im definitely going to call my obgyn and tell them about all of this but i was wondering if anyone else feels the same. Just feeling like im going to be stuck this way forever and the anxiety attacks/ depersonalization are making me feel like im crazy 🥲\n",

But his FMLA is running out and he is supposed to go back to work at the beginning of December.  It’s looking like I will still need to stay in the IOP beyond that - probably until the end of January.  Has anyone had to have their husband stay home beyond paternity leave/FMLA? I can’t stay in the IOP if he goes back to work because I don’t have anyone else that can watch our daughter.

I have never had issues with OCD before, and have rarely had much anxiety before pregnancy. Since having my baby, the anxiety has been so bad somedays that’s it’s nearly crippling and I found that I hyper focus on things (did I lock the door before I left, did I turn the oven off, triple checking things, etc). I have medication for days it’s extremely bad, but don’t like taking it much since it makes me so groggy the next day. I’ve tried other medications in the past that didn’t work either. Does this get better down the road? Are there any weird “remedies” that have helped anyone? I workout consistently, tried journaling, therapy, and meditation. Those things have helped a little.

My husband (27) says they were always at somebody's house every weekend, he lived with his grandparents for like a month just because. Both his mom and his dad's sides would get together at their house for bbqs and what not, it would have been like 25 people, probably more. He spent the night at all kinds of different people's houses. Both sets of grandparents watched him and his siblings frequently. MIL is also definitely going through some shit, her and my FIL divorced several years ago. She's a boy mom to 5 boys. Idk if her new husband doesn't give her attention or what but she's always going on about missing her boys being little and nobody needs her anymore and she's always trying to get them together and she gets all bent out of shape if you can't. She says it's fine, but you can tell it really makes her sad. \n",
            "My husband and I have already decided we aren't leaving our son anywhere for a while, and we're probably not ever doing sleepovers. She doesn't know that yet, that'll be a whole other ordeal. My son has severe reflux that I've been trying to get under control for 4 months, and if you've had a baby with reflux you know it's awful and so stressful. Other than that he's the perfect baby, super sweet and happy when he's not in pain. So I don't really feel like visiting my needy MIL. I don't have the energy to deal with her anymore, I can't even fake liking her anymore. I can't look at pictures of her when she pops up on facebook. She was texting relentlessly, sending tik toks of grandma's playing with their babies and saying \"maybe someday I'll get to be like this with Noah\", texting that were \"holding him hostage\". And now she's posting pictures of him on facebook side by side with a picture of my brother in law saying \"I think we can all see the resemblance\" but throwing in that he has my eyes. I get it, but DILs don't want to hear about how their baby is a carbon copy of yours. I responded to a passive aggressive text the other day saying I just needed to be left alone for a while. She understood, or at least said she did. Then my BIL posted a picture of him when he came over for 15 minutes to help my husband with something, and that's when she plastered it on facebook (without asking, i don't care that much but still) telling everyone he looks just like her sons. \n",
            "I hate her. I don't want to hate her at all, she means well (or at least did before all the comments and facebook stuff) and i know she's being snooty because she thinks I'm keeping him from her to be an asshole. But i literally cannot stand to see her, hear about her, and I definitely don't want to visit or have her anywhere near my house. I don't want him going anywhere without me for a while, so my husband visiting and me staying home is not happening. My husband won't talk to her. I hate myself for being so hateful and I want them to have a relationship but I can't get over it or even fake it. And now LO is starting a sleep regression and I'm going to be even more irritable with less sleep in addition to reflux. Idk what I'm hoping to get from this, and of you've made it this far thank you for reading. \n",
            "I'm going to go to the Dr once I have insurance and tell them what's going on, but that might be a few weeks. Idk what to do in the meantime. Hubby loves me and says he's gonna help me through it, God bless him. But i don't want to be like this for his and my sons sake. I know I'm partially in the wrong, I think its a lot of miscommunication too, but she's so emotional that we know telling her we don't want to see her so much would be a whole thing (and I don't want to see her at all for while because it just makes me worse). I love my son so much, I was made to be a mama. I was not made, however, to be a part of a big social family. I don't know how to fix my hatred. \n",

It took me months to finally start to feel like myself again and be able to sleep without the use of meds. Looking back I often think it’s a miracle that I survived.

Four months ago when we first met, he observed our children for awhile and said they are some of the healthiest kids he’s ever seen. We all noticed that my younger twin’s fontanelle hasn’t closed and he told us to wait another 4 months and if it hasn’t closed by then, we will do genetic testing to rule anything out.

I feel like she’s bored or just spoiled despite me trying to get her to be independent and not held 24/7. (Yes I hold my baby I just don’t want to have a Velcro baby) My anxiety this time around has been absolutely unbearable. The thought of not knowing what night time is about to bring for me, or not knowing how much sleep I will/will not get makes me panic before there’s technically anything to panic about. If she happens to be sleeping at night I find myself laying awake despite being so exhausted because my stomach is in knots thinking about her waking up as soon as I fall asleep. My husband tells me to just calm down and take it minute by minute, but my brain is just not wired to do that. I feel like I want to run away because I feel like I can’t breathe.

I was in the doctors once a week anyway for a bp check and thank god my GP genuinely cared about me because she listened to me cry about the side effects of this medication so many times. I didn't change to another medication because it was doing the right thing for my BP just had to put up with the side effects for 8 weeks. \n",

It was that but on my legs, my knees would be the reddest part and BOILING hot to touch, it was as if the blood was pooling into my legs so much there was no blood anywhere else! If I stood for long enough I couldn't bend my knees or bend down they were so painful, but the minute I elevated them on the sofa, GONE. I was hating every second of making bottles or picking my baby up because of this symptom. I was on here almost everyday searching for someone else with this problem so I'm hoping that this will help someone if they are worrying too.

I’ve been to the er multiple times, and I even called the ambulance once. I’ve had ekgs, bloodwork, an echocardiogram, a holter monitor, x-rays, and everything comes out normal. The holter monitor caught skipped beats and some tachycardia, but it did not catch one of the episodes I’m worried about. My left leg has been swollen since birth and it finally has gone back to normal. Doctors tell me it’s anxiety and prescribed me buspirone, hydroxyzine, and propanol. I take 5 mg of propanol in the morning, and I take 5 mg at night. I’m also nursing. I remember having palpitations when I had my first baby, but not near as bad.

Last year or so, I was referred to a psychiatrist I think thats the right word Im sorry my medical lingo not great to talk about my anxiety disorder. My anxiety surges in amazing highs and lows, where one day I think Im the best contender for Prime Minister, and the next I think Ill be a crack head for the rest of my life. My therapist thinks my anxiety is chronic, and that I was probably born with it or developed it in early childhood. The psychiatrist said that while I definitely met the standards for having GAD, my level of daytoday functioning does not require intervention on our part. Basically, he said I didnt need any drugs, and that if I wanted to, I didnt even have to keep seeing my therapist anymore. I dont see my therapist anymore, and its been over a year since Ive taken a psychiatric drug. My anxiety is still pretty much the same, and sometimes I really feel like I should be in therapy or medicated to help with it. But when I called back to my local mental health clinic, my anxieties described in the intake interview were not serious enough to warrant our action. Basically does anyone else have any similar experience with this kind of thing? Honestly just hoping someone tells me Im not crazy', 'output': 'This person describes high-functioning anxiety and feelings of invalidation from mental health professionals.\\n\\n**Ryff Scale Insights:**\\n\\n*   **Autonomy:** Challenge external validation dependence. Practice independent decision-making.\\n*   **Environmental Mastery:** Set achievable goals. Focus on strengths and past successes.\\n*   **Personal Growth:** Embrace learning, even from setbacks.

I see a beautiful natural landscape with a lush green meadow, a calm lake, and dense forested hills in the background. A majestic deer with antlers is gracefully walking across the grass, adding life to the serene environment. The overhanging tree branches frame the image beautifully.  This image brings a sense of peace, joy, and relaxation. The vibrant greens, blue sky, and fresh atmosphere make me feel happy and connected to nature. It’s a perfect representation of tranquility and harmony.  Yes, it reminds me of family trips to the countryside and moments spent in nature, enjoying the fresh air and scenic beauty. It brings back memories of hiking, picnics, and peaceful walks near lakes.  This could be a story of a lone traveler who stumbles upon this hidden paradise while seeking solitude. As they sit by the lake, watching the deer roam freely, they realize the true essence of peace and the beauty of undisturbed nature.  Yes, over time, the scene could change with the shifting light of the day. The sun might set, casting golden hues across the landscape.
