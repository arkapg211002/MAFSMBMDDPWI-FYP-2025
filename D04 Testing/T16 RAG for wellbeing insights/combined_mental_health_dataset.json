        "text": "Treatment resistant GAD Hi everyone, I'm 28 and have been dealing with persistent, severe anxiety symptoms since childhood. I've been diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder, OCD, agoraphobia, and somatization disorder. My anxiety is marked by recurring physical symptoms like dizziness, near-fainting, tachycardia, sweating, nausea, and brain fog. These symptoms cycle weekly and are accompanied by intrusive thoughts and hyper-vigilance that make daily life a challenge.\n\nI've tried a wide range of treatments, including SSRIs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and other meds, but most either didn\u2019t help or worsened my symptoms. Benzodiazepines provide some relief for panic attacks but not for generalized anxiety or OCD. I\u2019ve also explored alternative medications like Clonidine and Lyrica without success. My symptoms are present 24/7 and i never get a break ever. When my condition flares up during the day it becomes so bad that i am not even aware im having anxiety, i just feel delusionally sick physically and mentally.\n\nI\u2019ve spent years undergoing medical tests (MRIs, blood work, specialist visits) to rule out physical causes, but no definitive answers have emerged. My psychiatrist suspects underlying bipolar traits, and I\u2019m being referred to a specialist for further evaluation.\n\nI\u2019m looking into nardil as a next step and am curious if anyone here has had success with it for anxiety.

What does your day look like.. I\u2019m scared\n\nI\u2019ll explain my situation if anyone wants to read. I had panic disorder when I was a teenager. Then two years ago I had this horrifying anxiety attack that lasted 11 days, and it completely changed my life for the worse. But I\u2019ve never had \u201cnormal\u201d anxiety. I mean as in the daily anxiety feeling that lingers. I\u2019ve only ever had it as an extreme anxiety or panic attack, and then when it\u2019s over, the anxiety slowly calms down over the course of about a month. But two months ago I started having \u201cnormal\u201d anxiety. I it started as a day long anxiety attack, and then it calmed down. Or so I thought, cause 2 months later I\u2019m still anxious and I\u2019m so confused and scared. I\u2019ve had my blood work done to check if there\u2019s anything wrong. I had low b-12 levels, and also folate deficiency which can cause anxiety, but after a few weeks of supplementing the anxiety is still here and it\u2019s scaring me to think that this may never pass. I\u2019m not used to this. I had a panic attack a few days ago, the first since I was a teenager, and I\u2019m so so so so fucking scared. (I categorize anxiety attacks and panic attacks as two different things. Anxiety attacks feels like panic attacks, but lasts multiple days. Panic attacks lasts a couple of hours) I\u2019ve always said that I\u2019d sacrifice every limb of my body if it meant I\u2019d never experience anxiety again. I\u2019d rather be chronically physically ill forever than live with anxiety. And now I\u2019m anxious every day. I\u2019m so scared that I\u2019ve developed generalized anxiety disorder. I can\u2019t live like this. My psychologist says I have to accept the anxiety for it to get better, but I\u2019m not capable of sitting in it.

I\u2019m looking for advice or to know your experiences with procrastinating because of being so overwhelmed with having a noisy head while trying to work on anything. People often say: don\u2019t think just do it/ 5 seconds rule/ start and you\u2019ll build momentum/ eat the frog/ quit the illusion of perfectionism/ use the pomodoro  technique. While all these are great suggestions, they still don\u2019t work for me because my problem is the inability to focus on the task from the non-stop fearful thoughts. It feels like multitasking between working on the task and trying to quiet my brain or respond to the persistent anxious thoughts (which a lot of the time sound rational and worthy of attention so, I always fall for it). My fear response slows me down so much, I don\u2019t know what to do about it!! All of this creates quite a stressful, resulting in a feedback loop that makes me chronically procrastinate and conclude that I\u2019m incompetent. I\u2019ve been like this for many years and it\u2019s starting to get worse. Nothing has worked. Body doubling helps only a little and not all the time. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and CPTSD and have been doing therapy and taking meds for many years yet.

        "text": "Urgent Help About two months ago my stepmom started developing an extreme phobia of bad weather (fear of winds, storms, and tornadoes, specifically). My dad is at his wits end and has no idea how to help her anymore. \n\nJust to offer some background on the complexities of the situation, my dad is 60 years old and works full time, she is 35 and stays at home with the kids (10 month old baby, 3 year old toddler, and her son who is 15 years old). None of them speak English very well. My stepmom, stepbrother, and 3 year old baby brother all moved to America a little over a year ago. My dad owns a trailer that he\u2019s lived in for the past 11 years in the suburbs of Chicago. My stepmom knew this before we began the paperwork process to bring them over here. Everything was normal and peaceful the entire time they\u2019ve been here until one day in February or March when the power went out in the trailer because of a storm. It came back on the next day, but my stepmom says that\u2019s when the fear started.\n\nFlash forward to September when I moved out, she started experiencing panic attacks, crying, losing her appetite whenever there is even just wind sounds outside. She checks the weather everyday and at has even left the trailer with the kids in the middle of the day a couple of times. She doesn\u2019t know how to drive and doesn\u2019t speak english. On one occasion, she asked the neighbor if she could pay him to drop them off at Walmart and she stayed there with all the kids for the entire day until my dad got out of work and picked them up. Now she asks my dad to book a hotel room for a day so that she can stay there with the kids because there\u2019s a forecast of bad weather tomorrow. My stepbrother has missed a lot of school because he\u2019s staying at home with her.\n\nI found her a Spanish-speaking psychiatrist who she\u2019s met with twice now via telemedicine in the past three weeks. The psychiatrist prescribed her trazadone, setraline, and most recently hydroxyzine. I sent her over a list of therapist who she can set up an appointment with to start counseling but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s called anyone. Her symptoms don\u2019t seem to be getting better and my dad doesn\u2019t know what else to do. All she says is that she\u2019s scared to live in the trailer. He\u2019s now selling the trailer and plans to move into a more expensive apartment for nearby so that she can be calm and so that their lives go back to normal, but they\u2019re waiting on the apartment application to be processed. In the meantime, things don\u2019t seem to be getting better and this problem has turned their entire lives upside down. My stepmom says that when she\u2019s in a solid building she feels much better and doesn\u2019t experience any panic attacks, but that in the trailer her heart races and she feels like she can\u2019t breathe and she\u2019s just really afraid. My dad can\u2019t afford to keep booking them hotel rooms and he is threatening that if these problems don\u2019t stop after they move into the apartment then there\u2019s nothing more he can do. At night she cries a lot and that prevents him from being able to sleep and he has to get up for work at 4 am each day. He took a whole week off work last week to try to tackle this problem, I also went over there for a few days to help since I speak spanish.

Originally the plan was to take her to the ER, but the psychiatrist advised against that unless she is in the middle of a panic attack.\n\nCan anyone please help me help them. What kind of resources are available for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder? (These are the diagnoses she was given by the psychiatrist)They have no else who can help them nearby. The only other solution would be to send my stepmom and the kids back to Cuba where she would be able to live with her mom. But my dad would essentially be losing his family.

I\u2019ve been having nonstop anxiety attacks for 3 months and have suffered from an array of physical symptoms that have never left. I\u2019m now on one month of 20mg prozac and take xanax as needed, and have moved in with my family, which being separated from them in another country made the situation worse. I feel like now i\u2019m in a much more stable position but I still feel like absolute shit. I get daily headaches in the back of my head and temples, my vision hurts and I can\u2019t focus it properly, and my limbs feel extremely weak. Throughout this whole thing I also developed horrible health anxiety and i\u2019m constantly thinking I have a serio disease such as a brain tumor or MS, or even about to have a stroke.

        "text": "Do I have GAD? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making progress please help. I just don\u2019t understand where I\u2019m at. I\u2019ve been battling anxiety for 3 years now since college, and while I\u2019ve made progress, I\u2019m not so sure I have. I was put on medicine and took myself off (wasn\u2019t smart), but as soon as I started my first job, it came back. I tried to wean myself off again, and it wasn\u2019t working. I started seeing a psychiatrist this past September. He\u2019s been great and for several months I felt great. It wasn\u2019t until after I sat for a CPA Exam that i started to feel anxiety again for a few weeks. Perhaps I was awaiting the score, but all went well. A week later, the pandemic and quarantine started around St Pattys Day. Pretty much since then, I\u2019ve been on and off. One good week, one off week. Two good weeks, one off week. And I don\u2019t even know if off is the right word. It doesn\u2019t last the whole week or even a whole day, but it\u2019s this constant monitoring to see if I\u2019m anxious and how I feel. My anxiety has become this general feeling of uneasiness and worry with constant rumination. When I feel good, things are rolling along and I can\u2019t understand how I get caught in my web of anxiety. However, on the flip side, once I\u2019m caught, it feels as though I\u2019ll never get out (even though I always do and I know there is no danger). So I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m technically experiencing anxiety at this point, or I\u2019m psyching myself out due to fear and the past. Isn\u2019t it bad that in the fall I went months feeling good and now I\u2019m on and off all of a sudden? My doctor is contemplating putting me on 40mg, but wants to see what happens after lockdown. He says everyone is struggling right now, which I get. I\u2019m extremely analytical and my worse fear is this lasting forever. I even see posts I made a year ago asking questions regarding anxiety, so it seems I\u2019m in the same spot. My anxiety used to be panic attacks but now it is the symptoms I described. I exercise, I\u2019ve read books on it, but it always comes back. I don\u2019t wanna go on more medicine because I want to get off it one day. If it\u2019s necessary I guess I don\u2019t have a choice. How can I keep getting caught in the same trap every other damn week? Is there something wrong with me? Sorry for the long post, but can anyone give an opinion/advice/help? I have so many good things going on in my life, I hate this. I feel so close to breaking through as well, but then so far.",

I have a better understanding of my situation and can make myself calm by doing things that are right like postponing it(basically telling myself if i want to commit suicide, I have to do it tomorrow) which basically will not happen anyway as i will experience a whole different kind of emotion at that time.

It started a year ago when I was working as a waitress. I would get super dizzy nauseous and my heart would start racing. I thought it happened because I had a high stress job but I started to feel the symptoms out of work at stores, family events, driving, being alone in public etc. I got to the point where I started to isolate myself from everything. \n       I quit my job and made my boyfriend go into stores for me and getting takeout. He came and sat in the parking lot while I was in classes. Since then I\u2019ve been seeing a therapist and taking buspar and propranolol. I\u2019ve been pretty good about going into stores now with my boyfriend and I can go into gas stations sometimes if I\u2019m feeling good. I just think I\u2019m at the point where I want to hang with my friends and they kind of understand how I\u2019m feeling but I\u2019m nervous to spend time with them without my boyfriend or go and do anything without him for that matter. My therapist wants me to get out of my comfort zone and try to do things on my own but I get panic attacks. \n    I get a light headed heart racing feeling when I drive so I always worry about that happening. It\u2019s the scariest experience. I vape which I know doesn\u2019t help it but does anyone have any advice on how I can break out of my shell and become more social again?

Friend of mine (F/20) is constantly worrying (sometimes to the point of feeling physically sick) about everything in her life that could go wrong but will never really happen if you think about it, e.g. she worries she'll get breast cancer, that she won't get married, that she won't pass law exams that she cannot do until we finish our undergrad degree (at least two and a half years away) and these are exams that she doesn't even think she will do because she doesn't actually want to be a lawyer. She constantly puts herself down and says she's not good at things that from an outside perspective (other people, not me because I know she actually feels like this) seems like she's just looking for validation because it's obvious to everyone but her that she is actually good at it, e.g. she is currently ranked second in our class but constantly says she is no good at academic stuff. She has broken down in tears multiple times this year over the stress she feels and her feelings of being overwhelmed, and I honestly cannot deal with it any more. It feels like our whole relationship has become about her feelings of worry but she won't do anything about it. I've asked her multiple times if she would consider going to talk to a counsellor (she never has and she has never been formally diagnosed with anxiety, and I know I probably shouldn't do this but I do think she suffers from it) I've told her I'm worried about her, I've told her that at one point I considered calling her mom to help me get through to her because I was so worried. It feels like I'm talking to a literal brick wall and that nothing is going through. It makes me feel useless, and I'm getting to the stage where I've stopped telling her constantly that she is good at stuff, etc. because she's just not listening. I'm beginning to feel annoyed every time she puts herself down and I'm really trying not to but it's really hard to keep propping someone else's self-esteem up.

I had derealization 24/7 for 9-10 months but have snapped out of it, still get feelings of unreality on some days but it's not where near as bad. My main concern is that I am paranoid of being paranoid and it scares me so much. Ever since I was robbed I became mistrusting of people and when I was attacked I had a panic attack which put me in a sever state of depersonalization. Since then I began researching symptoms of schitzophrenia and is something I dwell on 24/7 it's always on the back of my mind. The biggest problem is that whenever I see something, I.e a person in a suit with a suitcase, if it resembles what you'd see in a movie, the person looking like an agent, I start to ecesssively think about why I though that and end up worrying about it all day. But at the time it happens it feels so real like I feel fear inside of me and am terrified. I am extremely scared of going insane and losing touch with reality. I also think I could have some ptsd as am very jumpy but I don't have any nightmares or flashbacks. It has sort of become an obsession. Whenever I get a depersonalization attack it makes me feel that everything around me is fake and this puts a seed of strong fear in me which makes me freak out and worry that am being paranoid and that eventually It's going to turn into a full blown phsycosis. I spoke to phsyciatrist as over 8 months ago and they were consistent in telling me it is not schitzophrenia. What worries me the most is the overwhelming feelings of paranoi that I get or is it the anxiety and fear that I feel. I don't believe the paranoia and know it's irrational but it just feels so real in the moment. Please could someone help. I am going to see a phsyc again and am not looking for reassurance but am really scared so if anyone can help at all. Is paranoia like this common with depersonalization? ",

        "text": "Ridiculous insecurity postpartum/need help and advice Hi friends - I gave birth to twins (my first kids) 8 months ago and it has been extremely difficult, and that is an understatement. I have anxiety at baseline, but postpartum has amplified that 100-fold. They were conceived naturally, and it was an absolute shock when we found out at my first ultrasound. I have been struggling badly through PPD, PPA, and extremely crippling insecurity, and I'm not sure how to navigate this (I do have a therapist, she is somewhat helpful).\n\nMainly, I am going through insane insecurity, specifically around my husband. The thought of him with other women makes me want to crawl out of my skin. I always had a level of being territorial in the past, but it was not excessive, more of like a \"this is my man\" but now, it gives me immense distress to picture him with anyone else. He is a good man and has not given me a reason to suspect that he's doing anything behind my back. The main thing that happened was that he went to a strip club on a bachelor party when I was pregnant (it was planned before I got pregnant, I was very newly pregnant when he went, and I told him he could go to the party since it had already been planned). In the past I was never bothered by strip clubs (I realize everyone has very different views on this and I respect them all) but after he came back and told me about it, I lost my shit and in postpartum it has become so much worse, like intrusive images of him with the stripper who he got lap dances from, picturing him in a very intimate situation with her, etc. I'm sure this event has augmented the insecurity and my hormones are not helping at all. He was very apologetic and has expressed a lot of remorse, not thinking it would affect me the way it did (I also did not think it would mess with me like it did). Really just looking for advice on how I can stifle this insecurity because it has gotten very bad. I haven't been able to lose the last 20 lbs I want to lose to get back to my pre-pregnancy body, and my c section scar just bothers the shit out of me whenever I see it. I just feel so broken now, I used to be so much more confident, excited for life, loved going out with friends and dressing up and I always kinda knew I was out of my husband's league (he has told me that before), and now I feel like a shell of my former self and sometimes with all the overwhelm of my life, I feel like its not really worth living anymore.",

However I\u2019m looking for insight from others as the internet only says Zoloft is likely to cause OVERproduction.\n\nI had been on Sertraline 100mg prior to my pregnancy for anxiety and felt the need to start it up again after having baby. November 14 I started the same dosage again, per the prescription/approval of my OB. Prior to this, I was producing 2.5-3oz per pump. By November 17th my supply was noticeably dropping and since then I am only producing .5-1.5 oz per pump at the very most.\n\nI have run the gamut with my lactation consultant trying to diagnose possible causes.. Stress, pumping frequency, pump malfunction, flange size, diet, etc etc. She finally had me get blood work to test my iron and prolactin this week and my prolactin was only 21 ng/mL when it should be upwards of 100. The only correlation we can draw is starting the Sertraline. \n\nOf course stopping the Sertraline is not an option for me at this time as my mental health is priority. But she talked with me about the use of Domperidone as a possible solution to get my prolactin up? Does anyone have any experience with using the Domperidone for this and/or any experience with a drop in supply when starting an SSRI and/or any remedies for this to get my supply back up? She also mentioned I could try supplementing moringa to help the prolactin but it\u2019s unlikely to make an impact to override the Sertraline.\n\nAny insight or shared experiences are appreciated, thank you!",

And now I have bad ppd and ppa. Anytime I start telling my story to them they hardly listen and they change the topic. They are topically positive, in my opinion. Sometimes negative things meed to be discussed.  I feel like they really don't care mich about what I went through and they just want to hog my baby. They are from another state across the country so I get they want to soak up baby time. But when she cries instead of bringing her to me they try to fix her up themselves and tell me \"she's fine \".  She isn't fine. That's her hunger cry...or her diaper cry...or her tired cry.  So when I tell them gently, she needs a new diaper they don't belive me and continue singing to her and walking her up and down the halls.  I corrected them when they fell asleep with her on the couch and when they tried holding her up high on a bar chair and I said please don't do that it could end badly and it gives me anxiety. They say she's fine. I'm like no please listen. Finally I cried to my hubby and he finally listened. I was seperate from my baby for a few days in the hospital while I was dying and then for weeks after I needed a lot of help with caring for her. So now that I can be the mom I want my baby to know I'm the mom and I don't want others trying to replace me. For instance when she fussed they wanted me to get them a bottle so they could feed her...but I said no I'm trying to only nurse her and use bottles for if I have to leave for an appointment or if I need a nap. For the most part she never gets bottles.  They acted like that's rediculous. But it's really hard to breast deed and latch her right now. She's 3 months and has regressed back to nipple shields which are a pain in the ass. I just want one thing to be natural and promote bonding so I'm really serious about breast feeding her.  It's going well till others try to tell me what to do. I was putting her in her carseat and FIL would not stop trying to help buckle after I said repeatedly that I got it.  Like when I'm caring for my baby as the mom, keep away and let me be. I don't need advice or help if I'm not asking for it.

I weighed about 220 when I got pregnant with my daughter. And after when I finished the pregnancy with my son, I weighed 282. Now, I weigh 225. A year has passed and I lost a considerable amount of weight. I am always upset that I can\u2019t get down to 200 quick enough. My body is still healing after having babies back to back. It is so hard for me to get used to my new mom bod, I never weighed in the 200\u2019s in my life and I am upset about it. Do you think I am being to hard on myself ?

        "text": "Father insults my marriage  I bought my daughter a Christmas Dress online and it came too small. I went and got my auntie to let it out and it fit my LO. When I was showing my dad the dress, he made a comment that the fun of things is in buying stuff in person and not online. That's what they always did. He was rolling his eyes whilst he said this. I told him that I actually enjoyed picking out my daughters Christmas dress online. Then I said 'I am starting to get irritated with your criticism and comparisons, it's annoying'. He totally brushed off my grievances and told me stop being so daft. If he had done it once or twice then fair enough but he would have small comments about feeding her, sleeping with her, playing with her, Christmas, etc... It was really beginning to ad up. \n\nHe tried to shut the conversation down and invalidate my comments but I wouldn't let him. I wanted him to listen to the fact that these little things were starting to become bigger. When I wouldn't let him brush it off he said 'Give over, I'm not your husband who will lie down and take your shit'. I was so hurt because he used something I said in a vulnerable moment and twisted it. You see, We are staying at my family home and I had opened up to my dad about how I'm struggling with postpartum and how I was getting too critical of my husband. I told my dad that I needed to step back and really re-learn to appreciate my husband. \n\nWhen my dad made that comment, I squared up to him and told him never to speak about my husband or marriage that way. He actually had the audacity to roll his eyes. I called my husband and we agreed that I would leave the next morning. \n\nCome 9am, I gave my mother my child so that I could pack the car. She was surprised as the previous days argument happened after she had went to bed. \n\nI feel absolutely terrible about leaving my parents home, as my mother started to cry. My daughter is their first grandchild and they love her a lot. \n\nThe reason I escalated the issue to leaving was because my dad can be selfish when it comes understanding how hurtful he gets. I wanted to nip this behaviour in the butt straight away. With my dad, actions speak louder than words. In doing so, I feel absolutely gutted for my mother. My daughter and I were suppose to stay with them for a week or so more. She was bawling when I left and it really hurt having to choose between letting it go and reinforcing a boundary \n\nWas I in the right?! Or did my hormones lead me to over react? ",

        "text": "First time mom  I\u2019m a first time mom. I spent the last nine months with hyperemesis and the last trimester with gestational hypertension. I ended up needing an emergency c-section due to my baby not getting enough oxygen as I was having contractions. Then, I spent a week in the hospital with Postpartum preeclampsia. Now, my colostrum is drying up despite me trying every way to stimulate my nipples, pump, and latch my baby on and my milk hasn\u2019t come in. I can\u2019t even hand express more than a dribble. It\u2019s been a week since she was born. I\u2019ve had to formula feed because she had lost 9% of her body weight 3 days after birth and was jaundice. I know a fed baby is a healthy baby but I was so set on breastfeeding and I feel like a failure. I talked to my OB about it today and she was going to prescribe me a medication to help my milk come in. Well, she called me later and said that I actually can\u2019t take it because it\u2019s the ONE medication that I\u2019m allergic to. I feel absolutely defeated. My baby spent around 6 hours in the NICU due to not transitioning well and she needed oxygen and a feeding tube so I didn\u2019t get a chance to do skin to skin bonding with her after delivery. Because I was recovering from my c-section and then the preeclampsia I wasn\u2019t able to take care of my baby like a mother should and my husband and our family did almost all of the feedings, changing her, and holding her. I feel like she doesn\u2019t have the connection to me that everyone talks about having with their baby. It feels like she likes everyone else more than me. I have extremely bad Postpartum Anxiety and I haven\u2019t slept more than a couple of hours in a week because I feel like if I fall asleep something bad will happen to her. I try to sleep and I just wake up with an impeding doom feeling and have to stare at her and watch her breathe so I know she\u2019s okay. I can\u2019t handle it. I have extremely deep stretch marks all over my stomach and an apron belly now. I hate how my body looks. I feel like it\u2019s failed me in every aspect. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m seeking from posting this but I just had to get it all out\u2026 I know I should just be happy that I \u201cgave birth\u201d to a beautiful baby girl. She\u2019s absolutely perfect and I\u2019m so in love with her. But, I can\u2019t shake the feelings I\u2019m having. Can anyone relate? Sorry for the long rant. I\u2019m just really struggling.",

        "text": "i feel bad that i\u2019m not more present with my newborn  i love him sooooooo much. he\u2019s almost 2 weeks old. i do have moments where i look at him and almost cry & sometimes actually do cry because of how much i love him & how happy i am that he is healthy since i was formerly using pain killers in the beginning of my pregnancy and vaping ( i got clean from both & joined a program when i found out i was pregnant at 22 weeks ) he came out with no health complications and im so happy to have him home. \n\nthe thing is ive had so much anxiety since bringing him home. i reached out to my psychiatrist and he perscribed me something for it, but honestly i don\u2019t think it\u2019s helping. i have a follow up appointment with him next week to reassess how im feeling. \nnothing and i mean nothing prepared me for this level of anxiety. i\u2019ve managed to ease some of it though, for example - when i brought him home i was soooo scared to fall asleep for the first couple of nights. i was scared i wouldn\u2019t hear my alarm or hear him crying when it was time for a feed. even though i have my mom & partner both here to help. \nnow i\u2019m able to fall asleep when he sleeps because i realized if i don\u2019t i LITERALLY cannot function. even 2-3 hour stretches of sleep is enough for me to function, but i can\u2019t function with zero 24 hours of no sleep. \n\ni\u2019d be scared for anyone to swaddle him because i didn\u2019t want it turning into a loose blanket. i don\u2019t even swaddle him myself bc im scared, but im getting velcro swaddles and my mom has swaddled him multiple times and fell asleep and he was still wrapped tight & fine. she swaddles him with his arms out bc he doesn\u2019t like being fully swaddled lol. \n\ni was scared to leave my bf alone with him while my mom stepped out, bc im like what if he doesn\u2019t hear him cry, or goes to the other room for a second , but i realized if i do all of the work my bf is never going to learn his cues and i need to give them time alone so he can learn the baby as well as i have, & so far he\u2019s done an amazing job and hasn\u2019t let me down. \n\ni was scared he\u2019d be too hot or too cold, but im like okay he\u2019s waking up every 3 hours, if he\u2019s too hot or cold i\u2019ll just change him into something else. everytime i wake him up he\u2019s fine. \n\ni was anxious about him crying during diaper & clothing changes - now im not because i realize he\u2019s a baby and he\u2019s going to cry when i do those things, i just have to talk him through it & do it quick and then he\u2019s literally fine. \n\ni\u2019ve eased all these anxieties on my own. yet STILL i have this overwhelming anxious feeling in my whole body and can\u2019t pin point why. i\u2019m starting to believe it really is my hormones because mentally i know everything is okay. he is always fed, changed & sleeps safe. i am meeting all his basic needs. these things reassure me, but my body still screams anxiety. \n\ni\u2019ve been so tired that whenever it\u2019s time for me to feed him ( usually this feeling mostly happens at night or around 3am ) whenever i have the bottle in his mouth i think to myself \u201c i can\u2019t wait for this to be over so i can sleep \u201c and i feel like SHIT about it. \ni\u2019ve waited so long for my son & yet im counting down the minutes til he can go to sleep so i can as well. i feel like a bad mom for it, like i should be enjoying these moments more, like im going to regret not enjoying his newborn stage. did anyone else have this feeling ? there are times when im well rested where i feel so calm feeding him. sometimes it actually is the only thing that calms me down, i love after i burp him when i rub his back & hug him and hold him tight, i feel so much love for him. \nbut there are other times where im like omg can he just go to bed already so i can have some sleep and quiet. i dont want to feel this way. i want to enjoy all the moments which is probably impossible but yeah. \n\nsometimes when he\u2019s wide awake im like ugh okay i have to read him a book or do something stimulating for his brain & i literally just don\u2019t have the energy to. i either do it anyways or make someone else take over. but i wish i could have the feeling and energy of wanting to. i just want the best for him.

        "text": "My postpartum has been horrific \nI\u2019m a FTM and my son is turning one on December 9th. While this should be a time of celebration, this past year has been incredibly overwhelming and painful. I lost my mom a year ago in December, and my small support system became nearly nonexistent.\n\nAfter my C-section, I was hospitalized twice for postpartum hypertension that came out of nowhere. It was terrifying, but I thought I\u2019d get a break afterward and finally focus on enjoying my time with my son. Instead, my son caught Covid, and we spent Christmas in the hospital\u2014on the same ward where I had been treated for postpartum hypertension. That period was traumatizing, especially as it coincided with the first anniversary of my mom\u2019s passing.\n\nWhen my son was five months old, I went to the ER for palpitations (likely a panic attack) and a spot was found on my lung. The waiting and testing that followed pushed my nervous system into overdrive. I was convinced I had cancer\u2014every new sensation in my body felt like confirmation of it. I was at the ER so often, terrified I had something like a brain tumor or metastasis. Thankfully, the spot turned out to be benign, but it was rare and required surgery in late June to remove part of my lung. Now I have to go for regular follow-ups, and the scan anxiety has been debilitating. My mom\u2019s experience with metastatic breast cancer only fuels my fears.\n\nIn July, I started experiencing palpitations again and was referred to a cardiologist. I was convinced I had pulmonary hypertension and fell into another dark spiral. Thankfully, all tests, including an echocardiogram and Holter monitor, came back normal- anxiety.\n\nNow I\u2019m dealing with acid reflux that has triggered another wave of health anxiety. Every new symptom sends me into a spiral of worst-case scenarios. I\u2019m terrified I won\u2019t feel well enough to enjoy my son\u2019s first birthday, and I desperately need this December to be free of more painful memories.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to share these feelings with other moms because I often hear \u201cI can\u2019t imagine,\u201d which makes me feel even more isolated. I\u2019ve been in therapy, focusing on trauma, but I still feel like I don\u2019t know who I am anymore. The health anxiety is consuming, and I\u2019m exhausted from crying so much.\n\nMy life has been so difficult and filled with so much trauma. All I want is to be able to experience my son, to be present for him, and to give him all the love and attention he deserves.\n\nOn top of this, my relationship with my husband has been strained. It\u2019s been painful to realize that some people can only show up during the good times and struggle when things are hard.\n\nI\u2019m just praying that 2025 is a year of healing, joy, and peace because I feel so overwhelmed and scared right now. I don\u2019t want to die and leave my son. \n\n",

        "text": "PPA? Yeah idk. Me and my SO met on hinge 2 years ago. We kind of instantly hit it off and have been inseparable since. In fact we got engaged fairly quickly and shortly after our engagement I had a car accident leaving me unable to walk for almost 5 months. We also discovered we were pregnant. He was amazing the entire time and took care of me in ways that nobody should even have too until we\u2019re old and sick. I will forever be grateful for him for that. \n\nWell our baby came in June. Everything has been great and we love him so much and our relationship has never been better honestly. Our sex life is phenomenal, our late night pillow talk is back to how it was when we were dating, we have date nights together and we text more because I\u2019m home with the baby and he\u2019s at work. \n\nI am and have been suffering for quite some time with PPA. It been a little better baby wise, was hoooorrrible for the first month or two, and has now switched to other things including self image issues and my need to try to look better. I\u2019m at my highest weight ever and as a girl who used to be able to go get her hair, nails and lashes done whenever I\u2019m now a mom with very minimal time for myself. It\u2019s been really hard. I\u2019ve also been trying to loose weight bc it will make me feel better over all to be healthier, especially with what trouble I\u2019m having with the repercussions of my injuries, that loosing the weight will make and help me get around better as a mom. (Before pregnancy 185, before birth 260lbs, now 240lbs and still going) \n\nSo lately I\u2019ve been feeling insecure in my relationship even though everything seems good with us. A lot has happened to us in our timeframe but I know we do love each other a lot. When I think about him (prior to this all of a sudden insecurities) he makes me feel safe, loved, heard and cared for. We truly believe we\u2019re soulmates and I wouldn\u2019t want to do life without him. But..\n\nThe other day we took the baby to his work for a holiday thanksgiving party. He introduced me and the baby and slipped up and called me Beth. Well my middle name is Beth, but his ex girlfriend who cheated on him with his bf while they were cling togethers name is also Beth. He corrected himself super fast and seemed extremely embarrassed and I didn\u2019t even say anything to him about it because we were at his job and I didn\u2019t want to argue about something like that when we never argue. We always talk things out. But for some reason my PPA wouldn\u2019t even let me bring it up. It was like if I shattered our perfect relationship with an argument about it or mentioned  it I was gonna loose my mind. \n\nAnother thing, he\u2019s been weird about my best-friend. She currently going through a break up with her baby daddy. We both love her son like our own as he spends a lot of time with us. He keeps jokingly saying after we spend the day with them that he\u2019s been \u201cthinking\u201d and that he and his mother (my bff) should move in with us. He says it jokingly as if he just wants them to do that bc he loves her kid but the amount of times he brings it up is starting to bother me. He also said something recently like it\u2019s fine ik you guys love each other y\u2019all can get married to each other and I\u2019ll just marry you. Like no I don\u2019t want to live and be with just you and not another woman thanks! Even tho I know he\u2019s kidding it rubs me the wrong way?? \n\nIdk outside of all of this like I said has been great. We want another baby, he doesn\u2019t even want to wait lol, and we want to get on with our plans to get married. He really is my bestfriend. Our families are planing to spend the holidays together and I\u2019m just upset w myself for not just speaking up and letting myself fester in this way. Idk why it\u2019s happening and it\u2019s very unlike me. I think I\u2019d I brought both of these things up hed be kinda shocked? \n\nIdk I just need advice and someone to talk this through w who is unbiased. Maybe someone who understands or has also had PPA or anxiety. \n\nWe were both in really long relationships before eachother. Not ones that were good either. His ex cheated like I said and mine might have as he ended up with one of my ex bestfriends as well, so I think that that might have to do something with how I\u2019m feeling as well. My ex and my ex bff getting together was a shock early into my pregnancy and I know I prob shouldn\u2019t have cared but I was just taken aback that they could do that after being friends (10 years) and my bf (8 years) for so long\u2026 I think that I really felt blindsided and thought I knew my ex better than that and it\u2019s seeping into this relationship. Like am I really just that bad at knowing peoples trie intentions when two very prominent relationships of mine ended and then they ended up together. Idk\n\nI feel sick lol. Someone help I feel crazy ",

Since the pandemic my mental health has slowly been declining. I haven\u2019t been able to put down roots in the way I wanted: I still don\u2019t feel like I have any of my own people here.

        "text": "I hate my MIL and I can't help it I'm a F(23) SAHM and just had my son 4 months ago.  I've always been an independent person, I hate being helped or pitied. My family was very antisocial growing up, I saw my mom's parents a few times a week but that was pretty much it, we didn't see my dads family except maybe 3 times a year. Nobody came over to our house and I wasn't allowed to spend the night anywhere. I hate when people tell me things I already knew. I have pretty bad preexisting anxiety, but I somehow function somewhat normally. I've been like this my entire life. \nMy MIL was definitely expecting to be a larger part of my sons life. My husband (27) says they were always at somebody's house every weekend, he lived with his grandparents for like a month just because. Both his mom and his dad's sides would get together at their house for bbqs and what not, it would have been like 25 people, probably more. He spent the night at all kinds of different people's houses. Both sets of grandparents watched him and his siblings frequently. MIL is also definitely going through some shit, her and my FIL divorced several years ago. She's a boy mom to 5 boys. Idk if her new husband doesn't give her attention or what but she's always going on about missing her boys being little and nobody needs her anymore and she's always trying to get them together and she gets all bent out of shape if you can't. She says it's fine, but you can tell it really makes her sad. \nMy husband and I have already decided we aren't leaving our son anywhere for a while, and we're probably not ever doing sleepovers. She doesn't know that yet, that'll be a whole other ordeal. My son has severe reflux that I've been trying to get under control for 4 months, and if you've had a baby with reflux you know it's awful and so stressful. Other than that he's the perfect baby, super sweet and happy when he's not in pain. So I don't really feel like visiting my needy MIL. I don't have the energy to deal with her anymore, I can't even fake liking her anymore. I can't look at pictures of her when she pops up on facebook. She was texting relentlessly, sending tik toks of grandma's playing with their babies and saying \"maybe someday I'll get to be like this with Noah\", texting that were \"holding him hostage\". And now she's posting pictures of him on facebook side by side with a picture of my brother in law saying \"I think we can all see the resemblance\" but throwing in that he has my eyes. I get it, but DILs don't want to hear about how their baby is a carbon copy of yours. I responded to a passive aggressive text the other day saying I just needed to be left alone for a while. She understood, or at least said she did. Then my BIL posted a picture of him when he came over for 15 minutes to help my husband with something, and that's when she plastered it on facebook (without asking, i don't care that much but still) telling everyone he looks just like her sons. \nI hate her. I don't want to hate her at all, she means well (or at least did before all the comments and facebook stuff) and i know she's being snooty because she thinks I'm keeping him from her to be an asshole. But i literally cannot stand to see her, hear about her, and I definitely don't want to visit or have her anywhere near my house. I don't want him going anywhere without me for a while, so my husband visiting and me staying home is not happening. My husband won't talk to her. I hate myself for being so hateful and I want them to have a relationship but I can't get over it or even fake it. And now LO is starting a sleep regression and I'm going to be even more irritable with less sleep in addition to reflux. Idk what I'm hoping to get from this, and of you've made it this far thank you for reading. \nI'm going to go to the Dr once I have insurance and tell them what's going on, but that might be a few weeks. Idk what to do in the meantime. Hubby loves me and says he's gonna help me through it, God bless him. But i don't want to be like this for his and my sons sake. I know I'm partially in the wrong, I think its a lot of miscommunication too, but she's so emotional that we know telling her we don't want to see her so much would be a whole thing (and I don't want to see her at all for while because it just makes me worse). I love my son so much, I was made to be a mama. I was not made, however, to be a part of a big social family. I don't know how to fix my hatred. ",

My daughter had NEC and has been in the NICU almost 2 hours away. I have two children at home so I couldn\u2019t be there everyday as they need life to be as normal for them as possible\u2026so I drive twice a week. That\u2019s my backstory.\n\nEver since I came home from the hospital (2 days later) I\u2019ve been having terrible migraines. I can pinpoint their location and it\u2019s been this way for almost 3 months now. I have upped my water. I take naps when I can. I make sure to eat. I\u2019ve developed anxiety as I feel the headaches make me feel like I\u2019m going to die and I want to make sure I\u2019m forever here for my 3 kids. My doctor prescribed caffeine Tylenol pain pills along with Zoloft. My anxiety got me worked up over the side effects on the Zoloft so I haven\u2019t taken it. I\u2019ve messaged my OB for a referral for a scan of my head, but do I really want to find out if something is wrong and not curable?\n\nJust yesterday I had an anxiety attack while going 80mph where I felt like I couldn\u2019t feel my face and my vision faded out. I feel like I\u2019m panicking now about having another episode like that when I\u2019m making the drive to the hospital or anywhere with my children.\n\nHow can I cope, what can I do. This is my first time reaching out for help outside of my husband. I\u2019m tired of zoning out to make sure these attacks don\u2019t happen, but I\u2019m terrified at the same time since I\u2019m a SAHM and I need to find ways to manage them alone.\n\nThank you for reading. \nSincerely, \nA mom that needs help.",

That didn\u2019t seem to help me at all as I felt extremely isolated and alone but was able to start some medication.

It took me months to finally start to feel like myself again and be able to sleep without the use of meds. Looking back I often think it\u2019s a miracle that I survived. I was able to wean off medication fully in early 2024 and then became pregnant again shortly after. \nMy pregnancy was going really well until the beginning of my third trimester- it\u2019s like a switch got flipped and I suddenly feel anxious all the time again and am unable to sleep at all without being back on medication.

        "text": "Never Say Never They say \u201cnever say never,\u201d but after my first child was born almost 10 years ago, I was certain I\u2019d never have another baby.\n\nOn October 11, 2014, after 29 exhausting hours of labor and an emergency C-section, my fianc\u00e9 and I welcomed a beautiful 9lbs 1oz. baby girl. For a brief moment, I felt pure relief. The worst was over, right? I could finally rest, get reacquainted with my body, and say goodbye to gestational diabetes and the dark melasma patches that had covered my arms, breasts, and belly. But that sense of relief quickly turned into overwhelm.\n\nI found myself on an emotional rollercoaster that was nothing like the blissful glow people promised. It was intense, all-consuming, and I felt like I was drowning in it. Waking up every two hours to pee during pregnancy was now replaced by waking every two hours to feed, change, swaddle, and soothe a newborn did not help.\n\nThen, just 18 months in, I became a single mom. Co-parenting brought its own set of challenges, but by the time my daughter was a toddler, I felt like I had made it through the trenches with one certainty\u2014I would never have another baby!\n\nSo certain, in fact, that I went to my OB and asked her to tie my tubes. She refused, convinced that one day I\u2019d fall in love again and want another child. She also explained that many doctors hesitate to perform tubal ligations for women with only one child. So, I let it go.\n\nFast forward almost a decade. I did fall in love again, but \u201cbaby fever\u201d never hit me. In fact, when I saw first-time pregnant women, I felt sympathy, silently hoping they knew what was coming. And moms with multiple kids? I secretly wondered if they were gluttons for punishment. As for that idea that you \u201cforget\u201d the pain of childbirth and the sleepless newborn nights? Not for me. I remembered everything vividly, and I had zero desire to revisit that chapter.\n\nNine years later, I reignited the conversation about getting my tubes tied. This time, my doctor agreed, but she cautioned me that most doctors no longer tie tubes; they now recommend completely removing them to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. That gave me pause. The idea of removing them felt too final, like I\u2019d be giving up a piece of my womanhood.\n\nI left the appointment with the option to schedule the surgery, but I never did. I told myself I\u2019d get a second opinion, but life got in the way. A new job and a new house took priority.\n\nThen, in January 2024, while sipping champagne and planning to turn the room that had once been staged as a nursery into a \u201cclothfice\u201d (closet/office), I started feeling nauseous. I brushed it off until I realized my period was late. After a few weeks of feeling off, I took a pregnancy test. Within seconds, two lines appeared.\n\nBoth my partner and I had always agreed we didn\u2019t want more kids and had taken precautions to avoid that outcome. But living in a state where I still had a choice, we decided that a baby still wasn\u2019t in the plan for either of us\u2014until\u2026",

I am finally over it but my daughter is still congested and coughing, we have been to the doctor for a sick visit and again there is nothing they can do besides suggest humidifier, suction, etc. \nI feel like i can\u2019t even leave the house bc i\u2019m so anxious, about her choking on her mucus or something happening. I know that she will be alright but why is this happening now. I physically feel ill if we\u2019re out and she has one tiny cough. Anyone else gone through feelings like this \nI don\u2019t know if i\u2019m just stressed out or if it\u2019s anxiety or what and how to get over this ",

        "text": "Heading to my primary tomorrow to talk about my mental health.  I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m actually experiencing ppd,ppa, ppr, etc, but I know something is off. \n\nMy son was born in March and things have been pretty good. I\u2019m a SAHM and I was a sahw before I got pregnant. \n\nLittle bit of background on my stressors: \n\nWe\u2019ve been going through some financial struggles the last year or two because of changes at my husband\u2019s job, Like we were doing great before his company was bought out by a bigger company. He financed a rarer vehicle (it\u2019s a 1996 don\u2019t get too excited- but he\u2019s never financed a car before), proposed, and we planned a wedding for 6 months later. Right after he proposed and we set the date they got bought out and shtf. Took him 6 months of job searching to find somewhere else only to be let go when I was 33wks pregnant. He found a new job a week before my son was born, thankfully. I was driving Lyft to help pay bills while he was unemployed and searching. Mostly the midwife bill because my payments in the last month and a half were basically an extra mortgage. \n\nHe was at that job until about a month ago because the promises of enough work to make what he was making before his first company was bought out (he was paid by the book hour not hourly rate) but it only got slower and slower with lots of empty promises to turn on direct repair with a major insurance company to get more work in. \n\nHe\u2019s been at the new job for 3 weeks or so, and is making an hourly rate and working OT. His first check had no OT and was finally a decent check that is helping us get caught up. I\u2019m hoping finances stop being a stressor now. \n\nThe last few weeks, I\u2019ve really noticed I have no patience for anything. I\u2019m not sad, but I cry when frustrated or angry and always have. \n\nThis weekend really made me think about the possibility that it\u2019s more than just stress. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure. So when I do the ppd survey I score like a 4-7 and 12 is when they say it might be ppd. But I have been irritated as hell. \n\nSo Saturday I hadn\u2019t eaten all day because it\u2019s hard to find time I can eat and finally sat down to eat a bowl of soup when he went into the kitchen to get food for himself. \n\nHe was pissy because we have a fruit fly issue due to me not being able to clean the dishes often enough. So I got pissed and decided that cleaning the kitchen was now more important than eating in the moment. \n\nHe took our son outside with him after I screamed at him about how I feel like I can\u2019t get anything done and he needs to be more present. \n\nSunday, I woke up at 8, walked into the bathroom to the smell of dog pee. Got pissed. Hubs let the dogs out and asked me where their food was (I\u2019ve been cooking at home for them) it wasn\u2019t thawed because I forgot to pull it out last night. So he gave them cat food and comes in and says I gave them some cat food. I was like wtf does some mean? Did you feed them or not? Do they still need food? Or are they good. He wasn\u2019t giving me a direct answer and I flipped. Like he was like no I just gave them some they still need food but them saying he fed them. Idk it just irritated me. \n\nI\u2019ve had thoughts about how much I\u2019m failing as a wife and mother and I finally told him today that sometimes I think it\u2019d be better if he just leaves me. \n\nMy primary has previously mentioned she didn\u2019t realize she had ppd with her first until she had her second and I just don\u2019t know at all anymore. \n\nAnyone have any thoughts that could be helpful?

It's all very sad, which is why I feel like it's my job to help others, experiencing the same pain, as I had.\nThis list is meant for those who are sick and tired of trying meds that never work, & for those who are looking for answers that they can't seem to find. \nIf you follow it, daily, it'll work. It only takes 3 weeks to make new habit pathways in the brain, so in 3 weeks, you'll be a brand new woman.\nReady??\nSay this outloud, and tell me how it feels.\nI am Powerful, so I revitalize with the Sun\nI am Transformation, so I replenish with Water.\nI am a Mother, so I honor myself as I care for others.\nI am Worthy, so I am aware of what goes in and on my body\nI am Peace, so I allow myself to rest and restore\nI am Life, so I breathe consciously and deeply.\nI am Creation, so I influence my surroundings with sound.\nI am Strength, so I exercise for endurance.\nI am Energy, so I bring awareness & control to my thoughts and words.\nSo why, right? WHY do all this? The Sun is a natural healer, & vitamin D deficiency side effects, cover most ppd symptoms.  Getting sun (best in am) will help balance hormones & blood pressure, it will also help regulate serotonin, Melatonin & your circadian rhythm.\nWater- not only are we made mostly of water, but it makes up 70-80% of each cell within us. It's used to energize & help dump out toxins, add more water, and reignite your cellular health.\nSelf-care is something we honestly take for granted, but it must be prioritized as an act of self love. Having proper self care habits, literally prevent depression & even cancer, that's how important it is. It also drives our self-worth, and you are so worthy of love \u2764\ufe0f\nBringing awareness to what goes in and on our bodies, will help you understand the environmental effects your choices are having on the body's reactions. We put so much harm on and in us, just bringing awareness to ingredients will increase mindfulness & deeper understanding to cause and effects we experience. ALSO the gut creates the majority or serotonin & dopamine in the body, so give yourself a fighting chance.\nRest & sleep- it's paramount we get adequate rest, so many will say \"there's not enough time\", but we only have time for what we make time for, so always prioritize rest/sleep over screen time. It's not worth your mental health taking a nose dive that day.\nBreath is Life, so when you want to add more life to your day, breathe more deeply. Doesn't need to be excessive, just consciously add deep breaths. Our breath matches our emotions, so if you want to master your emotions, master your breath as a short cut.\nSound- everything carries a frequency, everything is energy. So to influence your energy, and your surroundings, quickly, add sound. Chimes, singing bowls, bells, clapping, humming, solfeggio frequencies, healing tones, classical music & binaural beats, work best.\nThought awareness is KEY! Our thoughts make up our feelings, and both create our day. So to create the day we want, we've gotta manipulate the thoughts we put out into the universe. No more damning ourselves with things like \"this is the worst\" or \"I hate...\" or \"I will never...\" because everything we say, creates more of it. Everything we focus on GROWS. So be careful what you're growing.\nI'm praying this reaches all who need it, you are all so worthy of love, care and healing. Start now, there's never been a better time than NOW \u2764\ufe0f Your soul with thank you for it \ud83e\udef6\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\n\n",

I was in the doctors once a week anyway for a bp check and thank god my GP genuinely cared about me because she listened to me cry about the side effects of this medication so many times. I didn't change to another medication because it was doing the right thing for my BP just had to put up with the side effects for 8 weeks. \n\nAnyway the side effect that was making me worry so much was that every single time I stood up my legs from hips downwards would flush like MAD. I have never seen anything like it, you know when you go bright red faced when nervous? It was that but on my legs, my knees would be the reddest part and BOILING hot to touch, it was as if the blood was pooling into my legs so much there was no blood anywhere else! If I stood for long enough I couldn't bend my knees or bend down they were so painful, but the minute I elevated them on the sofa, GONE. I was hating every second of making bottles or picking my baby up because of this symptom. I was on here almost everyday searching for someone else with this problem so I'm hoping that this will help someone if they are worrying too.

To me, I think I\u2019m just doing a three second blink, but I think it\u2019s actually much longer and it\u2019s happening at inappropriate times, such as during people\u2019s presentations (I feel terrible about this). It\u2019s even happened driving, and I literally slap myself to make it stop. Has anyone else had this issue? I suppose it could just be an inability to stay focused, but I feel like it happens more within a couple of hours of me taking the medicine. ",

I even studied abroad for 2 years when I was 17 and I loved this part of my life. When I came back home to pursue my studies, it felt a bit strange but I kept it together and had a pretty full social life. Then I turned 20 and my life became hell. First I started having insomnia, then I just started throwing up randomly and feeling nauseous all the time. My thoughts were eating me alive and I could not tell anyone about it. That's when my panic attacks started. It was almost everyday before going to uni. Nonetheless, my life was perfect on paper. I am a sociable and conventionally attractive woman who just graduated from my country's best university. So I kept pretending for a few months that everything was okay and started obsessing over fitness to the point where I lost a lot of weight. I felt palpitations continuously and could not eat without feeling like I was going to choke on my food. I would feel hot all the time and start sweating excessively, which never happened to me before. I was a complete mess and could not face my reflection in the mirror, but nobody knew. I spent the summer doing all these medical tests to find an answer, then I faced the truth last month and went to see a psychiatrist. I got diagnosed with GAD, PTSD and OCD. I take 100mg of sertraline everyday, it's been 4 weeks now. I don't know how I got there. I used to be a perfectionist and a true workaholic. I was not scared of anything and always felt like I was special. Now I just feel like a waste of potential and a burden. I am screwing everything's up and I am relying on medication to stay alive. If there was a magic pill to come back to who I was a few years ago I would take it, but I know that's not possible. I can't even go out or take public transportation without feeling threatened by others. I kinda figured out how I got there, people were harsh with me for years because they thought I \"could take it\". Well, turns out I can't anymore. The thing is, I don't know how to get out of that place, and it's killing me. It's such a pity for me to say that my physical appearance is the only thing I have left, and I keep thinking about how it will one day fade away and how lonely I'll be. Maybe it's the side effects of my medication making my anxiety worse for a while, but I really don't want to turn 21 with such little hope for the future. No one around me seems to understand what anxiety is really like, so I guess I wanted to reach out to people who might understand my situation or who have had similar experiences in the past. Is there any chance for me to get better ? Is there anything I can do besides taking pills and hoping for the best ? ",

I act nonchalantly around people and act as if all my problems would solve by themselves, but I worry. I worry all the time, whether it be big or small, the last thing I've achieved was my high school certificate 4 years ago. I've done nothing after it and I am currently at my lowest point ever. Every night I wonder if things truly get better even when I think of just committing suicide to make all of my problems disappear. \n\nI do know that I need help and I'm currently following therapy in order to come out as a stronger person, but as of right now I don't see the benefits at all. There are so many things I want to achieve but I just know I can't, because that's who I am. A guy who says a lot but never shows the work. Only my family and some friends know about my situation and I'm surrounded by good people but I just feel so fucking empty all the time. I also never experienced love with a girl due to my looks, I wouldn't say I'm that ugly but I'm just average and slightly overweight. I always thought some romance I my life could make it better, but now I just think I'd make my future partner crazy if I were to tell her all this.\n\nEvery now and then when I'm thinking about how shitty my life is suicide seems to cross my mind more and more, although I never really go further than that I still silently cry because I was like: \"What the fuck was I thinking? There's people who want me to succeed and to laugh\". But I just can't do it anymore. I'm tired and I feel like nothing is helping, at this point it's just a coinflip whether I wake up happy or depressed. I've also never really vented on the internet before so that's a first. It's gone so far that I made a fresh account just so I can evade my friends that follow me on my main account. I sincerely think that I'll be dead in the next 5 years, I don't care if it's a war, or I get killed, or I commit suicide. I just know I won't make it past 25.\n\nAnyways that's about it regarding my situation, if any of you guys want to ask questions or just talk I don't really mind. Since it probably won't matter anyway.",

In the beginning it was just small comments. And I trusted him so I let it go. And then they got bigger and he got meaner. Eventually I was convinced nobody would ever want me so I stayed. Once we ended, he was so mean and just tore me apart. Paragraphs about how I was ugly, nobody would ever love me, he never loved me, ect. It got so bad that my parents were going to put a restraining order on him.\n\nIt\u2019s been about a year and a half and im still not the same. I am trying to get myself back but it feels kind of impossible.\n\nI miss not feeling like a nuisance to everyone around me, I miss being able to talk things out with people without fear of them being mad, I miss liking myself and how I looked. I am so tired of this ruining my relationships with friends and potential relationships with guys as well. (Just fucked up a talking stage with this guy I REALLY liked because I was scared to talk things out). I miss the passion that I used to have for things. I used to be so passionate about my writing and crocheting and my style and the people around me and now im just kind of here. I was so so special. Just a ray of sunshine and laughter and I made everyone around me feel so happy and special.\n\nAnd now im such a shell of myself. I still like crocheting and dressing up and everything but i am not as passionate about it. I am no longer kind. I am so mean to people for no reason. I am in therapy, on medication, I go for walks, I journal, but it feels like I\u2019ll just never be me again. I have goals. I work towards them and I am trying to better myself because yes, he did fuck me up but it\u2019s my choice to either stay that way or get better. And I know I can get out of my depression but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be ME again. \n\nIm not mad at him anymore. It\u2019s not productive. And i understand him. I understand why he does those things. I understand why he\u2019s so mean. I just wish I got away sooner. I wish this wasn\u2019t my first relationship. \n\nEveryone keeps telling me to forget and move on but I just can\u2019t. I can\u2019t move on when I deal with the effects of this every day of my life.\n\nAnd the worst part is that people don\u2019t believe me. He gets away with it. He\u2019s on the news for some bullshit he pretends to care about and everyone\u2019s like \u201comg he\u2019s so brave for speaking up\u201d and in reality he\u2019s just pretending he cares about people. 2 of my friends still talk to him.\n\nI just want to be myself again.

Thanks :) \nHi,\n\nI'm 21F, and I feel like sharing how I feel because I\u2019m not sure anyone around me would truly understand or even want to listen. Nobody seems to get me\u2014especially my mom, who I unfortunately have to live with for a long time. She\u2019s ill, possibly with bipolar disorder and other illnesses, and, sadly, she\u2019s made me a mess. Maybe even messier and angrier than she is. Yet she still doesn\u2019t understand me.\n\nI have a loving boyfriend who tells me I'm the most wonderful woman he's ever met, that I\u2019m beautiful and kind, and that he\u2019s never known someone as pure as me. But I don\u2019t see that. He doesn\u2019t see the real monster I feel I am\u2014the ugly, flawed person I see in the mirror, the face I can barely stand to look at. I hardly ever take pictures of myself; I avoid mirrors as much as I can.\n\nWe might get married one day, but even then, I feel haunted by the fact that I never met my father. He\u2019s even more of a mess than I am. Who would walk me down the aisle? I don\u2019t have an uncle. I can\u2019t even face my best friend and tell her I\u2019m not who she thinks I am.\n\nI feel like a failure, like I\u2019ll never be \u201cnormal.\u201d I rely on medication to stabilize my mood, and I may have to take it my whole life. My therapist doesn\u2019t seem to care about how I feel\u2014she\u2019s only concerned with my mom\u2019s wellbeing, never mine.\n\nAm I not important? Not to my dad? Not to my mom? To anyone, really?\n\nI don\u2019t even know what I love, or what my favorite color or dish is. I don\u2019t know who I am or what I want to do. I feel empty, unable to put words to anything. I can\u2019t even cry.\n\nSometimes, I don\u2019t even feel like my diagnosis is accurate. I feel messier than just \u201cbipolar\u201d\u2014like I have an illness no one\u2019s ever identified. It\u2019s like I have maggots crawling inside me, eating me from the inside out, and all I want to do is tear my skin open to get them out.\n\nBut I can\u2019t self-harm, because if my mom found out, she\u2019d just call me crazy, a failure. And with her heart condition, it could even be dangerous for her to see me that way.\n\nI\u2019m scared of death, too. I don\u2019t believe in any religion, so I have no idea what comes after. What if I\u2019m already dead?\n\nAm I just bipolar ? Or maybe I also have BDP? Maybe affective schizophrenia? \nHow am I supposed to know that even my therapist doesn\u2019t listen to me !!!  ",

        "text": "I was assaulted by another woman and now I don\u2019t know what to do I was sexually assaulted by a woman a few weeks ago.\n\nWe had casually hooked up a few times, not really knowing each other in a sober context, mostly just meeting up at college parties and making out, etc. One day she encouraged me to get high and then asked to go back to my room place. When we did she raped me.\n\nI was so high that I barely knew what was happening. I had initially consented to kissing and above the waist stuff. But she quickly grew more aggressive and it progressed to more- both her touching me between the legs and using my hand to pleasure herself. I\u2019ve been sexually assaulted before (by a man) so I just froze, I couldn\u2019t move. When I finally came to my senses I tried to push her off of me and told her that I needed a break/to text my roommate/find my phone. I kept repeating myself but she refused to stop. \n\nI finally pushed myself up and tried to get out from under her, but she pinned her legs around me and forced me back down. I told her no, but she didn\u2019t listen and kept going. The next day my arm was sprained from being held down with it pinned behind my back. I also had visible hickeys on my neck, which made it even more triggering.\n\nWhen I finally got her out of my room after physically forcing her off of me (she kept saying ten more minutes and continuing to make out with and touch me despite my protests. I had eventually just surrendered and lay passively while she did what she wanted) I felt nothing.\n\nI washed my face and immediately went to bed, feeling uncomfortable, used, and terrified. I didn\u2019t know what had happened, or if that was normal for sex. I\u2019ve never had sex with a woman before so I didn\u2019t know.\n\nThe worst part is I continued to see this girl for over a month before finally cutting things off yesterday. After this incident I\u2019d still go out with her, even though she regularly ghosted me on planned dates, blew me off, and objectified me in front of other people, treating me like arm candy and talking about me in overly sexual ways in front of people I barely knew. She also always found ways to turn our planned sober \u201cdates\u201d into affairs where both of us were drunk and/or high, and when this happened she was always aggressively physical with me (even though I had said I\u2019m uncomfortable with PDA) in public spaces, pinning me up against walls/tables and making out with me roughly. \n\nMy friends noticed this and were always uncomfortable by it, and said they were worried for my safety. I brushed it off and made excuses, and kept seeing her.\n\nThe day after the assault my roommate made a joke about my hickey, saying something about how it looked like I\u2019d had a fun night. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I didn\u2019t know what I was supposed to do, or what had even happened.\n\nI still feel like it was my fault. I put myself in that situation, saw the red flags and kept telling myself it was okay. Every time she did something cruel or inappropriate she would say I deserved better and apologized. I always told her it was okay, and I put up with all of it.\n\nFinally I cut it off, after she told me she didn\u2019t have the time to commit to our relationship and wasn\u2019t going to be available much. I called it quits and told her we were done. She almost cried, for some reason, even though she had practically initiated the split. Mind you, we were never officially \u201ctogether\u201d, just seeing each other for around two months. \n\nI\u2019m just now processing the assault after we\u2019ve broken up. I\u2019d rewritten in my head to be just a bad sexual experience. I\u2019ve even lied about it to my friends about it being enjoyable, just rough. I\u2019m having a really rough time coming to terms with it, and I think I\u2019m finally feeling the effects of the trauma in full force.\n\nIf anyone else has had experience with female on female assault, please let me know any advice you have. I don\u2019t know if I can continue to even say I\u2019m a lesbian, as the word leaves a bad taste in mouth now. I don\u2019t know how I can continue to date women. Anything having to do with sex just feels raw and wrong and violating. I don\u2019t understand how people can enjoy it. I walked away from my first sexual encounter wondering if I was actually asexual because of how horrific it had been. I feel like a fraud even calling myself a lesbian anymore. I don\u2019t know what I am.\n\nAny advice is graciously appreciated. Thank you.\n\n\n\nJust wondering if anyone else here has dealt with this, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of resources for lesbians/women who were raped/assaulted by other women. I\u2019m 18F, also.",

In addition to that, I would go long periods being distant with him, then try to make up for it with acts of kindness or treats.\nLove bombing became a major and horrible habit for me.\nNone of it was intentional and I truly cared for him, but I felt so much relief after I broke up with him.\n\nDuring that 7 month relationship, I was undiagnosed with what I now know is Bipolar Disorder, which seemed to line up with the love bombing.\n\nLooking back, I still did care for him, but not once when I said I love you did I mean it the way he did, and I relize now I still can't tell the difference between strong platonic love for someone, and attraction.\n\nNow someone is interested in me.\nI really like him, I really like spending time with him, and I don't feel ashamed if myself with him, but I can't do that again.\nWhen he confessed the way he felt, I told him I felt the same way, because I do, but I fear I'm doing the same thing again. \n\nI never dated in high-school and have no desire for anything besides close platonic physical contact with anyone I have ever known. \n\nI'm medicated now, but extremely irregulated and emotionally volatile.\nI'm terrified that if he sees me as more than a friend, he'll see the kind of neglectful asshole I am because I'm too absorbed in my own problems to care for another person.\n\nI want to be normal, I want to have normal reactions and thoughts and feelings. I want to be able to go on normal dates and be normal around friends. I don't want to feel like I am a different person every single day so I can have stable relations with others.\n\nDesperately looking for some advice from others who may have gone through something similar.",

I don't trust many ppl. I've been trying to gear up to kill myself for the past week. Slowly destroy myself with alcohol and sleeping aids since it wont take me out quick enough. Im too weak to actually get a gun and shoot myself. I can only hope I fade away eventually. \n\nI see this apartment that's basically a house in my birth city I'd be okay with getting. My birth city holds a lot of sad memories. But its the only other place I'm familiar with. I could afford it monthly with the right job, but there's a list of things keeping me from it. I don't have my license due to anxiety, I'm states away from my birth city, I'm trying to find a remote/local job but I don't qualify for anything id actually like. Im trying to study for both a payroll job and my license, but my lack of motivation and feeling of being overwhelmed is baring me from moving forward. A payroll job isn't even what I truly want to do, living in my birth city is just a last resort. I want to do music and art but it seems like thats just a dream. I want to stay in my current city, i cant afford it making $20/hr.

Hi everyone, I would really appreciate if you could read or skim this and help me out a bit.\n\nThe past couple of years have been rough on my mental health and I couldn\u2019t figure out the cause. \n\nIt all started when I had a bad hangover for the first time ever (mind you I never really drank so it was new to me) as I was on a train. I felt like I had to throw up for 2 hours straight, and there was nothing I could do about it. I was panicking and my anxiety was to the roof. \n\nA few days later I started having random panic attacks and I would start shaking and every time I tried to think of something happy or positive, it just didn\u2019t work. So now I was depressed because of that, I mean nothing really brought me the same joy as it did before.\n\nFast forward a bit and it started to get kind of better, I didn\u2019t drink or do anything to make me feel like I did on the train.\n\nIt\u2019s been 1.5 years since the train and things have been all right (not terrible but not the same level of happiness before). All until I threw up, and this was not because of alcohol. \n\nExactly one month ago from writing this post, I went to the gym and went past my limits and I also ate some granola and potentially expired milk, I don\u2019t remember. All I remember is the horrifying feeling of \u201coh god im gonna throw up\u201d and it you just knew there was no stopping it. The uncomfortable feeling of choking while my stomach acid is burning in addition to the severe panic made me almost faint. I had to slowly lay flat on the ground to calm down.\n\nNow within the month after this happened, I have felt so mentally low with many panic attacks where I shake uncontrollably and essentially don\u2019t see a clear future as bad as that sounds. I mean if this is what life is going to be then what is the point.\n\nI am constantly doing everything in my power to not ever feeling like I did a month ago, because that was hell.\n\nI am scared nothing will work to help this but I want to be back to my normal self. I was so happy and enjoyed life, and now I can\u2019t enjoy anything without worrying. \n\nTo conclude this, from anyone\u2019s experience, do I have emetophobia? And whether I do or not, can this get better to the point where I can enjoy life again?\n\nAdditional notes: I am currently seeing a psychiatrist but he doesn\u2019t know about this whole throwing up thing yet, and I will not ever consider suicide, but I would give anything in the world to make this better.",

I was in dangerous situations from a young age, as I grew to a teenager, I put myself in a lot other dangerous situations with my temper and lack of control, and ego. \n\nI\u2019ve been in a lot of altercations. I\u2019ve been attacked many times, I\u2019ve attacked people many times in retaliation. I\u2019ve been jumped, beaten, kicked and stabbed at different times in my youth. \n\nI\u2019ve lived a beautiful life for the last 2 and a half years or so now. I survived. Today I feel like random people who I just met are untrustworthy or trying to take something from me. I don\u2019t let anyone walk behind me (I\u2019ve been jumped from behind), I can\u2019t trust anyone and I\u2019m always in a state of tension and readiness. \n\nMy mind has cleared up a lot, I\u2019ve talked thru a lot of the flashbacks and situations where me/people I love were almost killed. I\u2019m very hopeful for the future and I live a good life, I cleaned up, got off drugs, went to college. I\u2019m doing great. The faces of my old enemies began to not startle me anymore when I would see them in my head. \n\nBut I can\u2019t just relax. I\u2019m lying in bed rn, and the last thought I had was about an older man I met for the first time today, he literally was so nice and we had a good conversation\u2026 I was thinking about this as I lay down but then my head comes out with \u201cif he tries to fuck me over I\u2019m gonna kill him\u201d. \n\nFor context, I\u2019m a fit 19 year old man. He was far older and smaller than me. This thought made absolutely no sense. Why do I see innocent people as a threat? It\u2019s not like I always see them this way but I can\u2019t get the smoke to clear when the mood takes me. \n\nMy brain just said \u201cwhy would this random man be nice to you\u201d and it immediately became defensive. I come from a place where most people are extremely friendly unless you make enemies with them. It\u2019s like I think everyone has an agenda, things they want that they\u2019d be willing to fuck me over for. AND I KNOW ITS NOT TRUE\n\nI KNOW ITS NOT TRUE. \n\nI have been shown so many times that it is not true. It makes me feel like I truly am mentally ill, I\u2019ve never known anything different. I\u2019ve always been an upbeat guy, laughing all the time. When I was a child, before things happened, I used to only ever laugh or cry, there was nothing in between. I was always an intense kid. So maybe that doesn\u2019t help. \n\nI just want so badly to come home and actually believe that the fighting is over, but I\u2019m so UP all the time. It takes so little to set me off but the thing is I don\u2019t even realise I\u2019m \u201cset off\u201d. It\u2019s just normal to me. And then I realise people are afraid of me, intimidated. Cos I\u2019m in fight mode. \n\nLast night I couldn\u2019t sleep, and I was sick for the whole day, my stomach was so weak and nervy. I felt cold. My body wouldn\u2019t stop tho. Adrenaline kicked in at around 10am, just after I rested while on public transport for a while. \n\nGod I don\u2019t know. I just wanna come home. \n\nIt hurts me so much that people I love are afraid of me when they feel the intensity. They don\u2019t realise that in that moment I\u2019m actually a lot more scared than they are\u2026 and there\u2019s no good reason why anymore, it\u2019s been over for years, they\u2019re not coming anymore. \n\nBut I\u2019m just scared.

        "text": "Can you develop PTSD from being physically ill? Hello, hope everyone is doing well. Sorry if this is against the rules or a stupid post, I will delete it if people want me to.\n\nSo I've had a look online at some information about PTSD or CPTSD and in some regards it seems like I might fit, but in other cases I'm not sure. For example, I've never suffered abuse or anything like that, my family are great. So I thought I might share my experience and see if anyone here can offer any advice, if that's okay.\n\nWhen I was 13, I suddenly got really ill. I would feel like I was gonna be sick almost constantly, no matter what I was doing but I think it might've been worse when I ate. We had a lot of tests, for celiac disease and lactose intolerance, but couldn't figure out what was going on. I dunno how much I weighed but I wasn't eating and my weight dropped. Then after 2 months in December 2013 my appendix ruptured, so it looks like it was that all along.\n\nNot long after that I started having trouble eating, like there was a mental block, it was really difficult every time I ate so I avoided it a lot. Then I started to have OCD symptoms like having routines about everything and obsessing about the possibility of being sick. Things got worse and worse until I had to go into the psychiatric ward in 2015. I was there for 3 months, and by the time I left the eating problems and the OCD seemed to have receded.\n\nBut after I left, I realised that I no longer seemed to feel emotions or enjoyment about anything. I don't know when it happened or how or why but at some point while I was at hospital I went from crying every day to now having not cried in over 9 years. I'm just numb all the time, I don't enjoy anything or have any interests or passions or anything. The OCD and eating problems have returned but in slightly different guises, along with depression, and nothing seems to help, not therapy (CBT, TherapyForYou, counselling, group OCD therapy, art psychotherapy and currently seeing a private therapist) or medication (Sertraline, Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Vortioxetine and probably others I've forgotten) or anything. I had EMDR but the lady ended up stopping it because it wasn't doing anything. So now I'm stuck, I have no energy or drive to do anything, even the stuff people suggest like exercise or trying new things. I've read about things like the freeze response and it seems to make sense but I don't know what to do about it. \n\nSorry for the long post, I didn't know what was worth mentioning and what to omit",

There have been these kind of bombshells all year from spare siblings we didn\u2019t know about to major medical diagnoses. Heart attack, mini stroke, to a cancer scare.

Such a weird thing to be overly anxious about since it\u2019s so rare but I\u2019m one of those people that obsesses a little with it and I need some comfort. \n\nYesterday on a walk, a loose chihuahua mix cornered me and bit my leg. Their house was nearby as I saw the owners outside calling them and the dogs ran back. I went to the house and asked the couple for rabies paperwork. They were an older couple and said they are their dogs but their daughter takes care of all of that. They contact daughter who has the vet send her their rabies info and she sends it to me.\n\nThe date on the paperwork is 11/6/2023. Granted, the bite happened on 11/7/2024. My question was is the paperwork date the expiry or the date given? So I call the vet.\n\nThe vet says yes, it expired 11/6/2024. One day before the bite. If you want to get technical, like 10 hours before the bite. So I verify, \u201cokay, so he got a one year rabies vaccine?\u201d\nVet says \u201cno, he got a 3 year, but we always recommend a one year.\u201d (I\u2019m in Texas just fyi) \n\nI ask \u201cso if we are going to be technical, based on what you just said, the dog is current on his rabies vaccine?\u201d And she says yes. \n\nSo why is my anxiety still up in arms? The dogs rabies was \u201cexpired\u201d for ONE DAY. 10 HOURS. I know in my head rabies vaccines just don\u2019t go poof and they are just severely susceptible. Even so, if the dog had bit me 11 hours before and it was current, how much of a difference would that have made? Does anyone see where I\u2019m going with this? \n\nSo, what\u2019s your thoughts?

I always felt empty and chased the feeling of happiness. I didn\u2019t do anything super destructive like drugs and alcohol until now but I dissociated often. I\u2019ve been at a mental decline for months now before I could self regulate and be happy for months at a time but it\u2019s hard when you are constantly shot while trying to get up. For starters I lost my boyfriend which sucks but who cares then I found out I have stage 4 endometriosis and can\u2019t have kids. Ive been experiencing pain associated with that since I was 10. Then I found out I wasn\u2019t going to have a job because they weren\u2019t accepting transfers 4 weeks before I was moving 3 hours away. It took me 1 month to find a job and it doesn\u2019t pay anything close to what I was making before. I pay for my college as well as my rent with no help bc I\u2019m not eligible for fafsa or any aid bc my mom claimed me. I\u2019ve been here since Aug and I haven\u2019t made any friends and Im really into manifesting and had good results before but that has really let me down. I\u2019m running out of money and i probably will have to drop out soon bc I have to choose between school or a place to stay. My old friends never reach out and I always have to which makes me feel like shit. I want to get help and talk to someone bc i really don\u2019t see the point in living and never really have. It sucks when you don\u2019t really even need much just friends and money and I can\u2019t even get that. I always feel like I am a burden to people when I asked for help bc I get treated that way. I bring up anything and it\u2019s pls don\u2019t do this again bc I tried to kill myself when I was 12 because I was heavily getting sexually assaulted and bullied at school and by family. And plus who wants to hang out with a depressed person. I pretend to be happy and force myself to see the positive in everything and self regulate but it isn\u2019t working anymore. I can\u2019t keep pretending when nothing is improving. I\u2019ll just cry every night and wish my life would change for the better. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m personally a burden or ugly or worthless bc I\u2019m not but I can\u2019t live like this anymore.

I became a paramedic/ firefighter in a renowned party and crime city. The pediatric calls messed me up. I\u2019m sure my childhood influenced that. I had an extremely painful surgery experience in April 2023 where they had to do a thoracotomy (cracked my chest bones) and scraped my lung away from my back. They also removed part of my lung. I woke up screaming in pain. I never recovered physically, mentally or emotionally. I already had PTSD but now it is focused on the medical field. I get anxious whenever I have to go to the doctor. I have 3 chronic conditions so I end up having to go to the doctor way too much. Since my surgery I have gone into respiratory distress a few times and my spouse called an ambulance. I would get terrified when I saw it and begin to cry plus I would pee myself. I am so ashamed and have begged my spouse to just let me die. Not sure why I\u2019m posting this because no one but my spouse knows about the mounting anxiety, terror and shame I feel. ",

Every choice is confusing. I\u2019m nervous. Financial burdens are heavy. Would I feel a sense of comfort with 30k in the bank? Possibly. Is the anxiety building to prepare me for my next difficult action?     \n  Will I accomplish any goal I wish to achieve? Does a higher power watch over me? I hope.

The human begins to question which barrel is closer. I can\u2019t let the world see me weak. I am timid to admit my shortcomings.

I have fallen before and that is all I may do. Even the strength to lift 100s of pounds will never be enough. I must relax and calm my flowing mind of negative thoughts, for I am not weak, but careful in my judgement. I want to floss and brush, as to sleep beautifully. I pray my nightmares or dreams will improve. Is the past but a torment onto a weak mind? Help me remain calm and positive. Ever pursuing the goals, I wish to accomplish. I hope the things I desire are worthwhile. I crave beautiful, elegant, wonderful memories. I will continue to benefit my health with whole foods and water.

        "text": "Panic disorder, medication (and insight practice/nonduality) Hi all,\n\nI've suffered from generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks and derealization for years. It comes in episodes, and I recently just went through one of the worst episodes of my life, lasting for a few weeks. I've never used medication before, but finally broke down and saw a psychiatrist during this recent episode and got prescribed some meds. \n\nThe panic attacks are characterized by this intense feeling of being \"trapped inside of reality\". I have no way to describe it other than that. In the past I'd have a panic attack, but then be able to sort of get back to living life and forget about it. The problem during this most recent episode was that the idea of reality itself became a trigger - \"I am always inside reality, which means I am always trapped\". I know this may be incomprehensible to most people, but these thoughts and panic attacks induced real shifts in perception (derealization) where I perceive in my direct experience that I am literally trapped inside 3D space in the present moment. I am trapped inside experience itself. So for about 2 weeks I was in a state where I felt trapped like 24/7. Couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, constantly either panicking, in constant anxiety, or ruminating/obsessing over these thoughts and my direct experience of being a being/consciousness who is inside of experience. \n\nThe psychiatrist prescribed me mirtazapine, prozac and propranolol. At this point I've had 6 nights of mirtazapine (15 mg) and today was my second morning of prozac (10 mg). I've taken propranolol only twice and don't plan to take it for daily use unless needed. \n\n3 days ago I felt okay, yesterday I felt decent for much of the day, and today I'm feeling \"normal\" in a way I haven't felt in a long time. Reality itself doesn't feel threatening, and the thought about \"being inside reality\" that was triggering panic is not doing so.\n\nI should also add that I'm very into meditation, Buddhism and exploration of direct experience, so all during this episode I was practicing all kinds of insight practices to explore my experience and see how suffering was being created. At times it felt like there were minor epiphanies that led to a momentary release of suffering, but I kept finding myself back at that place of being \"trapped inside reality\". \n\nMy questions:\n\n1) I'd like to believe that my recent comedown was due to progress I'd made by studying my direct experience, but if I'm honest that is probably wishful thinking. It's probably the meds. But which one is working? As I said above, I've only been on mirtazapine for 6 days (nightly) and this is only my second morning of prozac. But today is the first day where I feel \"normal\". I don't feel high, I feel just completely grounded and normal. Could it be that the mirtazapine is helping, or maybe even the Prozac is already hitting on day 2? I've heard these meds can take weeks to take effect. To have something work on day 2 seems highly unlikely. Yet I feel so grounded and normal today. \n\nThe following questions are more for those who are into meditation, spirituality, studying direct experience.\n\n2) How do you reconcile your struggles with anxiety/panic disorders with your desire to walk the path? I'm left feeling a bit defeated - the states of suffering I went through were unbearable, even though I did my best to practice equanimity and acceptance. I feel defeated that I have to use medication and was unable to 'overcome' these states on my own. Further, I'm a big believer in studying direct experience to understand the truth of reality and how we create our suffering. Yet how can I reconcile the validity of studying direct experience with these states of strong derealization where I'm perceiving reality to be a certain way (i.e. that I am trapped)? During the episode I searched everywhere for a self who was trapped but couldn't find him. Yet it still felt like there was an \"I\" somewhere in experience who was trapped. \n\n3) Finally, how am I supposed to move forward with this knowledge I have? This knowledge that there is indeed some truth to the idea that I am a part of reality. In a way, that is true. Right now, it is not a threat. But clearly it has been/can be a trigger that can make my life miserable. And yet it's still true. I'm beginning therapy next week with a nondual therapist, and am hoping I can make some progress on my integration of this basic fact of life that I have been unable to integrate for over a decade and a half. Will I be forever dependent upon medication to keep me from panicking at this basic fact of life? \n\n4) Can anyone relate to this? This perception/trigger of being part of/inside of reality? I know it sounds bizarre, but it was my direct experience. Anyone else who is walking the path care to share their experience?",

Confused why I\u2019m upset when it wasn\u2019t personal and I have few memories of it I got seperated from my \u2018friend\u2019 on a night out and went back to her hotel to try and find her. My last memory of the night was in a room with at least 4 men in and was later found by other hotel guests naked in the corridor and my stuff was dumped in the outside bins. I woke up the next morning in her room not knowing anything bad had happened until I heard her on the phone to the police. Condoms with my DNA were found inside the room. \n\nA part of me is angry and upset that people are like that out there, but I know of the evil in the world and have read about much worse.

I\u2019m annoyed that I drank so much around someone I had never gone out drinking with before. I\u2019m guilty that I put my real friends through nights out with me as a liability. This I\u2019m blaming on being young and not setting myself strict enough rules around drinking. I have learnt from this and I\u2019m glad I will be safer in future.\n\nI also keep finding any excuse to make the men and their behaviour ok, like maybe I was compliant at first (still is rape). I\u2019m telling myself I know nothing, anything could\u2019ve happened. It wasn\u2019t personal. \n\nI am still finding myself getting upset for reasons I don\u2019t know.

When I felt it it felt like my beat was missing or fading and stopped and I instantly felt doom and weak and hot and I was like WOAH. I was 20 miles from home, phone was gonna die and I called 911 and laid down and felt horrible with shaking and tension in my chest, trembling and weakness. They came and did a ekg and blood pressure and blood oxygen and they said i seem okay, put me in the ambulance and said I really didn\u2019t need to go to the Hospital but I was pretty afraid and weak and shaky and went but of course I waited in the waiting room and they didn\u2019t do shit, like my usual hospital does.

All my live I have been riddled with anxiety and it really has had me in a chokehold for many, many years. The last 3 years of my life had been the darkest and it truly seems surreal I can look back on it and SEE it and am starting to understand it for what it is. It really had full control of me, my mind, my body, my thoughts, my voice and the choices I made. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and I\u2019m starting to really see it and most importantly feel it. Medication and therapy did kickstart this for me and the most awful times turned into just about bearable but life still wasn\u2019t enjoyable, it gave me that tiny bit of mental strength to begin questioning \u201cwhat is happening? Why is this happening? Is this really me?\u201d. These questions initially scared me and my mind was telling me all the wrong answers to them, trying to instil false reasoning like\u2026 Im just born this way or it\u2019s because of what I\u2019ve witnessed, how I\u2019ve been treated, there\u2019s nothing I can do I\u2019m stuck like this and I\u2019ve just gotta bear with it for however long till I meet my demise. This is all not true and I\u2019m really starting to realise and believe all these reasons of \u201cwhy am I like this\u201d was all something in me that was bigger, stronger and something I was simply identifying with involuntarily. My mind had tricked me for years controlling my emotions, reactions what I think, how I see things and how I should represent myself, I just wasn\u2019t the real me that I was tricked into believing. It took me a very long time to reach this point but there is a you that\u2019s in there, it just needs to be accessed. A major factor in this turning in a more positive direction has been reading and talking to people who have unlocked their real \u2018being\u2019. A book I can massively thank and couldn\u2019t suggest more is \u2018The Power of Now\u2019. Reading many posts on here I can whole heartedly relate to the many of people that are struggling with their own battle with anxiety and depression. I wanted to share this just in case it helps anyone like its begging to help me, I\u2019ve still got a long way to go but I\u2019ve finally started to get on a road that I\u2019m moving down and wouldn\u2019t wish any of what I\u2019ve experienced on a soul in the world. I realised it was only me that can change this and no other intervention was just going to solve any of my problems. It starts with you.

It was really abrupt and also really upsetting to see him that unwell and that I was unknowingly a burden to him. We\u2019ve talked it out, I\u2019ve been given all the answers I need, he broke up with me in the kindest most compassionate way, but regardless i am still extremely disregulated and struggling and given me a big ptsd flare up for weeks now, with little signs of improvement. I\u2019ve done all the healthy things - reach out to others, exercise, eat well, go outside, distract yourself, attempt to convince myself I deserve better, get on waiting lists for therapy, go no contact, get support from charities, try to be my own boyfriend. But I still end up feeling chronically unsafe and scared, I\u2019m in my final year of uni and im getting into dangerous territory with my fine art degree reaching nearly a month being away (every time I go in, I have a flare up/flashback to when I was a child, or when I make work, I think it subconsciously triggers things) and I recieved a diagnosis for ptsd yesterday.\nTo know the most important person in you life has chosen to live it without you, to be not as terrified of loosing you as you were about them, is a really difficult feeling with my past of abandonment I experienced as a child after facing SA.

Tw; gun violence \n\nA little over a month ago, | (28F) was walking my dog behind my house, a neighborhood where l've lived for years without ever feeling unsafe. Suddenly, a man wearing a ski mask holding a gun appeared from around the corner, pointing it at my face and demanded I hand over my dog. (Honey a 3 year old French Bulldog)\nSomething took over me and I instantly refused and used my body to protect her. He pulled the trigger right at my face, but nothing happened. He seemed surprised and tried again but it still didn\u2019t go off. Then he lunged and started hitting me in the head with the gun, telling me to stop screaming and trying to rip her away her from me. I kept screaming, and eventually, he fled. Honey and I were able to run in to a neighbor's house for safety.\n\nFor the first four weeks, I was in shock, unable to fully process what actually happened. I started therapy, and things felt ok enough that I was eager to jump back into work. Im absolutely terrified to walk my dogs or leave my house with them now but that didn\u2019t come to much of a surprise given what happened. \n\nBut the past week I\u2019ve become irritable and deeply resentful toward people close to me who haven't reached out or shown any support. So many friends and people from our local frenchie meet up group have acted as if this never happened and tbh really don\u2019t seem to care at all. I\u2019ve only getting 3 -4 hours of sleep a night this week and during the day at work I felt nauseous and had body aches.  But I assumed I was just getting sick or something. On my day off today, I felt completely fine! however, as soon as was in bed and thought about having to put on a face and be away from honey at work tomorrow.. instantly all my symptoms, especially the nausea, hit me like a train and I started to have flash backs which lead to a panic attack. I definitely see now that this is PTSD.\n\nI'm wondering if the resentment I feel toward people who haven't shown any support will eventually go away or if it's something I'll carry forever? I don't necessarily want to hold on to it, but thinking that l could have died and people close to me and honey don't seem to care makes me feel a level of hurt I can\u2019t even describe and tbh I don\u2019t know if I even want people like that in my life. \n\nI work two jobs, but my boyfriend has been incredibly supportive, encouraging me to slow down and focus on healing while he takes care of bills etc. I\u2019m considering quitting one of my jobs, but I\u2019ve only been there for three months, and as a chronic people-pleaser, I feel extremely guilty about leaving. I\u2019m also struggling with how to even explain my decision since I\u2019ve appeared perfectly fine since my attack. \ud83d\ude14",

If it was scary enough for me to \u201csee\u201d and experience, was it also scary for them? And this is not sympathizing. This is a question like from a PTSD standpoint. I often think the perpetrator just \u201cdoesn\u2019t have ptsd\u201d and I\u2019m left with it, but is it possible they have it too?\nI still feel an aura to them even though they did something so horrific I can\u2019t excuse or forgive.

I had my suspicions for some years that I was because my depression never really felt like normal depression but something much deeper and sometimes much darker.\n\nIt's been a lot to process. Finding out has brought a lot of emotions. Some of them have been shame because of the stigma around mental health and what I've seen. There has been a lot of finding out and thinking back to a lot of things, just going \"that makes sense now, that adds up.\" Between those feelings, a lot of things started to add up as to why when I felt a certain way in a depressive episode, I had no explanation as to why I felt that way, I just felt that way for no actual reason.\n\nRecently I had, what I am realizing now a mixed episode that is a big reason that I decided to be very open and vulnerable in therapy about how I've been feeling and how low the lows truly do get. I've been looking back at things and the signs of it were always there and a lot of times I just said I was going through a lot (I have had dealt with a lot of trauma) and it was nothing else other than that.

I thought about it, and decided to go for it and apply. Because you don\u2019t know if you don\u2019t try right? Well a month passed since I applied, and I started to be ok with everything. I felt like it was indicative that it wasn\u2019t my time. They went with someone else. I had moved on and was content with at least putting my name in the hat.\n\nEverything changed on Wednesday.\nI got notified I moved onto the next stage of the interview process and was given the pre-interview assignments. Suddenly, I felt the biggest pit in my stomach. I didn\u2019t understand the questions. The more I thought about the job, I delved into a panic attack. I didn\u2019t eat much. I cried so much. I felt like my world was ending. I got feedback from a few other upper managers at my job and I got a variation of \u2018do what\u2019s right for you, but what\u2019s the harm in doing the assignments?\u2019\u2026 and after a while I started to agree with them. I thought to try to do the assignments, but when I tried all the panic attack feelings came back. I felt so much dread. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I think there\u2019s something to be said about feeling this way about a job I don\u2019t even have and there\u2019s no guarantee I would get it. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong acknowledging that it\u2019s not the right fit, that I\u2019m content in my current position, and I don\u2019t want to move up the ladder at this moment in time. But I struggle with being a people pleaser and the feeling like I let people down. And that\u2019s what I felt like, I felt like I was letting those around me down for not going for it. But I had to do what\u2019s right for me. \n\nI let the proper personnel know that the job was not a good fit for me, I thanked them for the opportunity, and I wished them all the luck in finding the best candidate. I got a response from a top management telling me they understood, but they really encouraged me to do the assignment, that my background would help me and it\u2019s supposed to be difficult. \n\nAnd all those feelings of feeling like I let someone down came back up. I don\u2019t want to leave this place. It\u2019s not perfect, but I don\u2019t hate my job. I\u2019m content, I have a good group of people around me. It just doesn\u2019t feel right to change jobs. The grass isn\u2019t always greener on the other side. My biggest fear is what if I get this job, but six months in I realize it wasn\u2019t a good fit, but I can\u2019t go back to my old job. \n\nDeep down I know I\u2019m doing the right thing, but that weight on my chest just won\u2019t leave.

        "text": "Objectification/pressuring/coercion triggers Hi all, my first post here. I've been in therapy since early this year and was diagnosed with PTSD related to prior sexual abuse. I've been seeing a therapist and we're beginning prolonged exposure therapy. I also got into a new relationship within the last year and it's been really difficult for me to manage these new symptoms.\n\n*Trigger warnings of SA and self harm\n\nWhen I was 15, I began dating a guy a few years older than me. This was my first sexual relationship and I was excited and very interested in sex for the first time. Throughout our almost 2 year relationship, we definitely had your average vanilla teenage sex but mixed in was a lot of emotional and sexual abuse that I've been uncovering this year. I've always had a knowing that I was sexually abused by this person but specific memories didn't really come to mind until this year when I was retraumatized. I have had several sexual partners since this abusive relationship and didn't really feel triggered but now the triggers seem everywhere.\n\nDuring this relationship, I experienced a lot of pressuring and coercion. Sometimes he would accept my no and cheat as a result. Sometimes he would threaten to self harm/commit suicide if I didn't do as asked then show me proof. Sometimes he would just do things during sex and I felt I didn't have a choice. That fawning response still haunts me and used to confuse me if I was actually assaulted or not especially because it was over a long period. I was coerced into complying with nude photos as an underage teen. I was taken remote places in his car and had to comply to sex, I was yelled at during and afterwards if I didn't seem into it because I was dissociating and waiting for it to be over. I would try to push him off of me or stop him and he would pin my face and arms down as he was much larger than me. \n\nI have had intrusive images, nightmares and hyper vigilance from my current boyfriend overstepping a boundary during sex 7 months ago. I got angry at first then disbelief and betrayal, crying and just numb, not wanting to be touched at all. The next time we had sex I was so scared and almost in tears when in that position. I struggle with feeling like he really understood the gravity of the situation for me and I comforted him a lot afterwards. He hasn't crossed a boundary again and we have good conversations about what we both want in bed. I was having a lot of hyper vigilance and rumination about being unsafe and taken advantage of by him after that. I would dissociate at any sign of being unsafe. My therapist initially thought I had OCD. Symptoms have improved with therapy. Once that settled, I'm now really aware of my triggers but having all the discomfort, unease and scared feelings coming with them. I know these are signs of progress but it's still so difficult to be in a relationship and have this happening so suddenly and trying to to explain my pulling back or irritability related to it.\n\nI feel my partner is sometimes supportive and he understands I have PTSD. Other times I feel like he just keeps going and going with the sex talk and it becomes really triggering for me. Sex is very important to him and really makes him feel connected. Repeatedly bringing up how hot I am or explicit language about acts on my body can feel very objectifying and pressuring for me. What's prompted this post is him asking what panties I'm wearing 3 days this week and getting really hyped to have sex again. I feel disgusted, uncomfortable or scared he'll be mad at me instead of being turned on. It makes anticipated sex feel less exciting and more pressuring and like I owe it. I've felt scared about being pressured into things I don't want to do even though he's reassured me he does not want that. But he has made jokes about this, which feels triggering and makes me scared.\n\nI feel my trauma has really impacted my comfort levels with any sexual  exploration now even though I have in the past. I'm sad and frustrated that this happened over 10 years ago and like I can't have a normal sex life like everyone else. During sex I can thankfully enjoy it most of the time. \n\nJust posting as I'm wondering if others experience a lot of sensitivity around anything that feels like pressure or objectification. I'm realizing how much the emotional abuse really played into what I experienced. I appreciate anyone reading. I move forward knowing there's hope to a normal life again. ",

I'm not sure what I'm expecting but I'm pretty desperate thank you",

My ex was doing it all, all kinds of violence. But that wasn't what broke me. I broke up with him and he contacted all my friends to send them nudes of me. He blackmailed me to my employer and I got dismissed without further notice. He blackmailed me to my government. His claims: I'm a prostitute. I'm on drugs. I publish porn. I publish child pornography of my own child, I put my child on drugs. He put some videos of my child on pornhub that he took when my child was roaming around in a diaper on a sunny day. This is all really horrible per se. He nuked my whole social circle. But I was like fuck it and started a new life. I started dating my partner. Our anniversary is in 5 days. Right now he is working a lot and it throws me back to when he was working a lot in February but he was so shitty. He just came to eat what I cooked,To put dirty dishes in the sink. He also was using my computer cos his one was broken at the time so I was really isolated too. Whenever he had free time he went out with his uni friends (without me). In April I found out he said ily to all his female friends (and the girls he went out drinking with all the time). I have massive cptsd. Partly from what I went through in my previous relationship but the fact that he kicked me while I was on the ground amplifies my cptsd and just throws it completely out of dimension. Next month it will be a year ago that he treated me like shit, too. I was on a vacation with my mom shortly after we started dating and he ghosted me, partied the whole time, slept over at friends, battery on 1%. Later I went through his phone that he was texting everyone (including random girls like one for days 247 even) but me and he even gave his ex a birthday present for her bday last December. This I only found out in may. This year my birthday comes around and he's too broke toCome up with a gift on time. It was in September. Every time my cptsd is triggered I shut him out. And he has no EQ to know how to deal with it and everything just gets worse like right now.He has a lot of work right now and even tho he isn't acting like he used to but I keep having intrusive thoughts, spiralling thoughts like all the bad events accumulating in an endless loop and I know it's my trauma. He has no clue what is going on with me but I'm so on fire I literally wanna pack my bags and just leave the country with my son. Our anniversary is in 5 days and all I can think is I can't do another year like this. December will come and I will be so depressed about the anniversary of memories. And I shut him out I won't even talk to him because I don't feel safe to trust him with the pain I have because of what he did to me after my previous relationship. He witnessed it all. He was my friend during that time and the fact that he did that after I was so maliciously abused is hurting me more than the actual abuse. I don't wanna play victim here.

        "text": "Just need to get this off my chest  I start a new med today and I am a combination of fearful and optimistic. It\u2019s the first time an antipsychotic has been added to my regimen, and in a weird way, it feels like I failed. I\u2019m in danger of losing my job (for the millionth time) thanks to this cursed disorder so I\u2019m getting desperate to find a way to live better with these mood swings and stay employed and safe.  \n\nSome background: I had my first manic episode in 2016, absolutely spurred by SSRI\u2019s, and while I almost made the ultimate permanent decision to depart the planet, I was able to get help and that led to my bipolar I diagnosis, and the real work began.  \n\nWith proper support and meds, and essentially quitting alcohol, I stabilized for the most part by 2019. But then 2020 happened, and as someone who lives in the US during such an intense time, I backslid in a big way with my mental health. For the last 4 years I\u2019ve been going up and down like a yo-yo, on an overall downward trajectory. I\u2019ve cycled through multiple trades jobs since then, and early this year landed a carpentry job. I love the work so much, am learning a lot, and my natural creativity is a boon to this work.  \n\nUnfortunately, my boss (who I was friends with before getting the job, and still am) had to talk with me about my mood swings. It was done kindly but firmly, and I don\u2019t resent him in the slightest, but I am embarrassed and dejected about still feeling like a friggen slave to this disorder.  \n\nSo for the last 4 years, I\u2019ve said \u201cno\u201d to many medications because of the work I do. I\u2019m highly sensitive to medication changes, even small adjustments make me feel off for a few weeks. So even when things are extra activated, I\u2019m still refusing to try new meds that can possibly help. My refusal is always based on the demands of capitalism and the potentially life-ending tools and machines I use as a tradie. I can\u2019t be dizzy or sleepy or jumpy when using a table saw or router, it\u2019s unsafe for me and others in the shop/ on the job site. So I am always saying no to med adjustments so I can try to keep my head clear (lol), until last week.  \n\nAs an American, and a leftist at that, the last few weeks have been especially hellish. I saw myself spiraling, and foolishly thought I was masking it well enough at work, so I was crushed when my boss had to have a talk with me, as I\u2019m apparently killing the morale. Real, but ouch, but real.  \n\nI had a depressing revelation after that talk, when discussing with my psychiatrist what happened at work and how my mental health is tanking: I don\u2019t know if I can do work like this much longer. I kept choosing to stay on the current regimen of meds so I can safely use the tools of my trade, but my mood is canceling out any progress I make in my jobs. **It feels like there is no job in existence that wouldn\u2019t make my mental health worse.** And believe me, I\u2019ve tried to do a little bit of everything. I\u2019m almost fucking 40 and still don\u2019t know where I belong, and feel like any progress I make in a job is dashed upon the rocky shore of cold reality as soon as my mood becomes too intense to mask.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019m heartbroken. Just needed to vent. And I\u2019m crossing all my fingers and toes hoping that this new antipsychotic will help balance my broken brain so that MAYBE someday I can actually have a career, or at the very least, not have to live paycheck to paycheck.

I went to lay down and bring with my own thoughts laying down just made things worse.\nI started to freak out, breathing heavily, heart racing. My heart started to feel like it was going to burst out of my chest. I thought I was dying. I honestly feel like it was the closest I've ever been to death. Started questioning my life, wa so upset and ashamed that this is how I was going. I couldn't bear the thought of leaving my pregnant wife behind.  Felt like my life was flashing before my eyes. Eventually it settled, I calmed down. I was worried I was having a heart attack, and debated calling an ambulance. I convinced myself that how I'm feeling is just amplified due to the weed, so decided to wait it out and think about wtf happened coherently the next morning. \n\nIt is now the next day, about 18 hours since. I still have chest pain but feel like it comes on more when thinking about last night.\n\nI'm scared. Was it a panic attack? I think it was but what if it was a heart attack?  I just feel like my brain is all over the place and don't know what to do.",

        "text": "First timer anxiety / panic attack I would like to go see a doctor - but it\u2019s Saturday morning and my usual GP I go to only opens on Monday. Should I go to a different GP just to get help or should I wait it out to go see a doctor that knows my history? \n\nA little backstory. I have been suffering with chronic muscle pain for years. (12 years to be accurate) I have seen multiple doctors and specialists regarding this and they\u2019re still trying to pin point what exactly is the matter. Note that I have only actively started looking into/treating the muscle pain for the last 5 years. And I can only afford to see a specialist once a year max so it is a slow progress.\n\nNow these passed three weeks I have been noticing signs of anxiety. Tight chest, numb feeling - which are also symptoms of my chronic muscle pain. Buttt I also started getting really angry and irritated for no reason, I started feeling dizzy all the time and the tight chest felt more like a tight heart than the usual tight chest I get from my chronic pain. \n\nSo last night, my fianc\u00e9 wanted to go shower, and I switched off the geyser to save electricity. This is a common thing for us to do. He got a little irritated because getting out of a cold shower, even if it\u2019s a common thing for us to do to switch off the geyser, you really hate yourself a bit for not checking if the geyser was on. When I say he got a little irritated, I really mean a LITTLE, his reaction was minor and it completely tipped me over. \n\nI started with a cramp to the side of my rib cage, which is also common with my chronic pain, however this cramp/spasm felt minor to what I\u2019m usually used to. Shortly after the cramp/spasm my heartbeat started rising and I got even dizzier and a bit more shakier. I immediately started crying and I didn\u2019t understand why I was crying. I started getting irritated for being silly for crying for no reason and then I started to struggle to breath and this set off another sense of panic and overwhelmingness.\n\nA little while after I realised this may be a panic/anxiety attack and I need to calm myself down. I tried getting my breathing under control and I would eventually start breathing fine but still left traumatised. A little after that the breathing situation would flare up again and then I had to try and relax and focus on my breathing. This happened approximately 9-11 times within the next 90minutes or so\u2026 I was obviously not concerned about time or keeping a tally during this time. \n\nI obviously spent a bit of time on google after I managed to stay calm and breath normally again and most articles recommended seeing a doctor to make sure it was in fact and anxiety/panic attack and not some other underlying issue. Now the problem is that I know I have chronic pain and a different GP that\u2019s not familiar with my personality nor my history might request a bunch of tests which could potentially lead to a delayed diagnosis and/or unnecessary expenses (the unnecessary expense part is pretty important for me right now, I mean we\u2019re getting married soon and we\u2019re paying for it ourselves). But also, Monday still feels pretty far away and I\u2019m not even sure if I will get that appointment on Monday - there\u2019s a possibility my doctor may only have an opening Tuesday or Wednesday. So what do I do? And if anyone has any helpful tips please send them this way, I\u2019m scared to go back to that place of pure panic and I still don\u2019t feel 100% comfortable to go by my day. ",

I said I said hi and removed myself to another room.  He came in and said we have some administrative things to take care of.  I say ok, he tells me, I say ok.  He goes upstairs and texts me \u201cI have a few things to get off my chest.  We need to talk later\u201d.  This elevates me and I tell him it is unfair that he does that especially first thing in the morning.  \n\nI finally just go upstairs to ask him what he needs to get off his chest, extremely elevated at this point.  And he won\u2019t tell me,  we need to schedule a time to talk later.  I continue to ask him to please just tell me the bullet points.  He refuses and continues to lecture me about how all of this is harder for him because he has an anxious attachment.  He regularly has \u201cmeetings\u201d with me where he is the only one who talks.  Look, I know he has zero care for me, it\u2019s all about control.  Shortly later he slammed a door very loudly to the point both my kids said they were scared.  \n\nHow can I survive in this environment while making a plan to leave?  My nervous system is shot, but resisting him makes everything so much worse.  I hate him in the depths of my soul.  Please be gentle.\n\n",

I (21F) have been struggling with severe depression for a while.\n\nThose who don\u2019t know me personally would never even think to make this assumption as i am an optimistic performer. I have a very happy demeanor because I am hyperaware of emotional projection, and truly believe people do not deserve any sort of consequence to my personal misery.\n\nI realized my depression and time do not co-exist. I have now spent over 4 years bed rotting and neglecting my physical and mental health by consuming meaningless media, eating food, chasing moments of temporary happiness. These 4 years have felt like weeks, I can\u2019t believe the amount of time i\u2019ve spent neglecting myself.\n\nOne of the hardest things to wrap my head around is the fact that although my world has stopped, other peoples continue. I know it\u2019s unhealthy to put yourself in a state of comparison, but it\u2019s true. These years of my life have been crucial and I did it all wrong.\n\nMy peers are graduating college, while i got accedamically suspended at community college, now on academic probation as a first year student, when really i should be completing school.\n\nI\u2019m embarrassed, and my parents deeply resent me because of this. They don\u2019t believe in the concept of mental health, my depression is nothing but an excuse to my laziness to them, I wish they knew it runs so much deeper.\n\nI\u2019m so tired of living like this. I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so hard for me to love myself. I feel like a burden to everyone I encounter. I am constantly reassured by others that I am a positive light (and for that I am blessed) but my brain deems it as pity, or a wrong assumption due to them truly not knowing who I am.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long this will last, I fear that i will continue down this path and remain stuck in my misery. What sucks is I do believe I have so much to offer and have the potential to be successful, I just don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t be kind to myself.\n",

She was diagnosed with breast cancer back in 2023 and although she\u2019s clear now, my family have a long history of cancer. Both my grandmas had cancer, my uncle has been diagnosed with cancer recently (I think not too sure on details but my family never tell me anything) my grandmas sister died of cancer before my grandma was even born (she died at 2 years old of cancer). Basically what I\u2019m saying is that because there\u2019s such a long history of cancer my mother had an operation to have her ovaries removed so she wouldn\u2019t be at risk of cervical cancer. Also not to mention me and my sister are potentially very screwed over as we\u2019ve come to the conclusion we could be at higher rush of getting cancer. \n 2. My family is literally falling apart around me and I\u2019ve left most of the people I know clueless. I live in two different places (my friends mostly don\u2019t know), parents are divorced (again friends don\u2019t know), my mum quote literally has a boyfriend and two children (daughters slightly older than my sister who\u2019s 18). My sister won\u2019t make any efforts to get to know these people so I\u2019m on my own again trying to make myself likeable for a family I don\u2019t even care about.\n4. Exams, too many exams that I have 0 confidence in as I\u2019m definitely not an academic weapon and executive dysfunction is my worst enemy at the moment.\n5. Intrusive thoughts that are so bad. Every 5 minutes my brain is telling me stuff that just isn\u2019t true of telling me If I don\u2019t do a certain action e.g. tap a pen 3 times I\u2019m going to fail these exams.\n5. I can\u2019t end it because I\u2019d make people sad (I wish it didn\u2019t though) and also I don\u2019t want to traumatise my parents because they\u2019ve been through enough.

        "text": "I need some help  Apologies its a bit long. I was diagnosed with a disease called Ulcerative Colitis two years ago and was on medication for it to manage the flare ups for roughly a year and a half. It got so bad that I was just passing blood every time I went to the toilet, I was severely anaemic and still going to the gym throught it all. I was called in to the hospital for a blood test, then the day after they said I would have to come in for a 5 day course of IV corticosteroids to try and get it under control. \n\nSo I went in, was admitted to the emergency ward. I was severely dehydrated and in so much pain at this point. I was meant to be in for 5 days, but the steroids didn't work. They tried every other drug they could to try and help me but none worked. I was moved from ward to ward and despite my amazing team of gastroentologists and doctors they still couldn't help. Eventually they told me they would have to operate on me to remove my colon in order to stop me from dying. \n\nI obviously didn't want to, as it would mean I would have an ileostomy bag which was a big issue for me. However, I had no choice so I had the operation. The first 5 days after the operation went okay, I was in a lot of pain but not unbearable as it was managed by oral morphine and IV paracetamol. The operation was laparascopic, which meant small incisions = less pain. 5 days after my first operation I was in extreme pain. \n\nIt started around 8pm and got worse up until 1am, they gave me every drug they could (IV paracetamol, IV morphine, Oral Morphine, Ketamine, Fentanyl) but nothing would touch the pain. It got so bad I was begging the nurses to kill me or put me under to stop the pain. They took me for a CT scan of my abdomen, and it felt like when I was being taken down there (lying on a hospital bed) every bump was a knife in my abdomen and I thought I was going to die.\n\nThey discovered I had a massive build up of fluid and gas in my intestines, and took me down for an emergency operation at 2am, after I had been in unbearable pain for 6 hours. I woke up in the ICU hooked up to 5 different fluids and a morphine PCA. I was told I had suffered from a twisted bowel, which had constricted my stoma and killed a small portion of my small bowel. \n\nI was in the ICU for 7 days and they were horrendous, I had a NG tube down my nose, a Robinsons Drain in my side and a new scar down my abs. They had not done laparscopic surgery this time as they didn't have time to, and had cut me open to find the problem. As a result of them poking around in my intestines, my stomach had shut down and I had to have it aspirated by the NG tube every 4 hours, and wasn't allowed to eat or drink anything.\n\nEventually I got out of there and was moves to another ward for a couple weeks before I was discharged. I am getting healthier now, adjusting to my stoma bags. But whenever I hear anything to do with ICU, or hospitals or drugs or painkillers or anything at all that reminds me, it all comes back. Its like I'm right back there again, all the fear and pain and confusion is overwhelming and I can't do anything. I have day dreams about it and nightmares I wake up in a cold sweat. \n\nThe worst part is I don't feel like I have the right to have PTSD, like there are combat vets who have seen the worst a person can see and I have just laid in a hospital for 6 weeks. Anything have any advice on how to deal with this or any tips on how to manage when I have the flashbacks? Any help appreciated. ",

Anything from being addressed as the n word to being picked up and slammed to the ground while a friend of the main bully recorded me.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten a black eye from him even and nearly went blind. He faced no consequences as he was a master manipulator and people like him for being the high school \"Jock\u201d.\n\nHe always said sorry then repeated the behaviour and laughed with his buddies about it. He even made fun of my heritage (where my parents are from in Africa).\n\nI get an apology about two years after high school and it (in my opinion) looked like an apology for himself. Sure, he said he\u2019s sorry (he\u2019s said it so many times it doesn\u2019t hold value) and was more focused on saying in his apology \"I understand you probably hate my guts\".\n\nI accepted the apology because my dad told me to.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve been through addiction & other not-so-proud stuff I\u2019m not interested in sharing here. I decided to message him after all these years (been about 10 now) and it was a friendly message. Leaning towards me calling him a lovely person and how I understand if he still feels bad for what he did to me and said I understand the message could go unseen but I just wanted to share.\n\nHe, yet again, said he feels bad about how he treated me and said I look like I\u2019m doing well and he\u2019s happy specifically for that.\n\nI just asked him why he called me the n word all the time and would beat me up over it. I asked if he found racism funny at the time. He denied absolutely everything he did. I then sent him screenshots of how he use to speak to me and he said \"Man, I don\u2019t remember saying that, clearly I did though, there\u2019s no denying that photo. I honestly don\u2019t remember using that word with you or others. No one deserves that\".\n\nFor the sake of convenience of this post I\u2019ll make it short. We went back and forth over it and he accused me of spreading rumours about him over the last two years that he r\\*\\*\\*d his ex and said how I can\u2019t deny that as he has these messages pinned to my IP address.\n\nI blocked him and unblocked him after an hour saying how crazy that sounds and specifically said the last time we spoke was in 2018/19 when he messaged me out of the blue. I then tell him if he has all that info, what does he plan on doing with it? And said intimidation and what he claims to be true do constitute grounds for legal action and said we can take this to court.\n\nHe says \"James, for the hundredth time, I\u2019m done with these conversations. Chao for now\".\n\nI said \"for the record, I hope those things are not true Chris, I just can\u2019t connect the dots on why you think it\u2019s me who did that. Chao\".\n\nAfter a few days, I blocked him for good.\n\nLooking for advice",

I\u2019m almost 38, and after 18 months of trying to conceive\u2014with one ectopic pregnancy and an unsuccessful IVF round\u2014I\u2019m doing some serious reflection. My doctors tell me I could still conceive naturally if I keep trying, which I believe is possible. But I'm pausing to really think about what\u2019s best, especially with my family history of mental health.\n\nMental health issues are strong in my family. My mom has bipolar schizoaffective disorder, my dad has narcissistic traits, ADHD, and ASD. Growing up with two alcoholic, mentally ill parents meant any genetic predispositions my siblings and I had were bound to be triggered. As for me, I live with bipolar disorder, ADHD, and PMDD, and my siblings struggle with ADHD, ASD, OCD, anxiety, and depression.\n\nI'm in a happy, healthy relationship, living in a different country, financially stable, with a life that feels...almost idyllic. And yet, the thought of passing on a genetic predisposition to mental health disorders haunts me.\n\nSo, I\u2019m genuinely curious:\n\n* Did you inherit bipolar disorder or other mental health conditions?\n* Have you had children who inherited similar challenges?\n* How has your family navigated the ups and downs if you\u2019re parenting with a mental health history?\n* Is there a reliable genetic test for bipolar disorder?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your stories and advice\u2014especially if you've been down a similar path and had to decide between using an egg donor or moving forward with your own genetics.

        "text": "Being friends with the person who traumatized you Hey folks. Warning for potential violence and potential murder, it's not quite abuse so I'm not adding that tag. \n\nThe experiences that gave me PTSD were caused by one of my best friends who had PTSD themself, we lived together and due to certain circumstances I will not be discussing here, they were being triggered near-constantly. Their flashbacks were so bad that they would regularly forget who I was and would respond to certain situations violently, or sometimes they would get quiet and I would learn later that they were struggling not to attack me. I lived with them for about a month, and throughout that time I was never hurt, mostly through luck, coincidence, and a locked door.\n\nThat being said, it's been two years since I left. Unkind words were given on their part, I think because I was a constant in their life up until that point. But a few months ago, they reached out to me because of a personal situation that I could've had a stake in (I didn't) and we wound up talking about everything that happened. They were generally apologetic, and somehow we wound up saying that we would give friendship another try. \n\nWe mostly just play games together once a week, and discuss those games. We've strayed into serious conversations a few times, but I've put my foot down once or twice when we got too personal because we aren't close like that anymore. The thing is, though, I've been wondering lately whether talking again is even healthy?\n\nIt's complicated for me, because they used to be the person I looked up to the most, my best friend, the person I told everything to. Now I don't even tell them what I do for work and whether or not I'm in school. We just dance around everything that happened like it was an awkward moment for both of us. I enjoy talking to this person, I really do, but I don't know if it's going to hinder my recovery or not. My flashbacks were less frequent at first, and then they went back to their pre-reconciliation levels. They're not as upsetting anymore, but the distress has been replaced with confusion and frustration. My mood has also been more stable (I'm also bipolar). \n\nI don't think that they handled the situation well, really, but I also think that it's been two years and they know better now. Not perfectly well, but better. And I'm not going to ever see them in person again, I don't think, so they're never going to be in a position again where they could reasonably hurt me.\n\nSo, my question is, can this be healthy, considering all of the checks I've put on the relationship? Everyone around me is telling me that I'm making a mistake, but I care a lot about this person. A lot. They got me through some tough times, and I got them through some as well. I just don't know anymore. In any manner, thank you for reading. It means a lot.\n\nTLDR Is it possible to be friends with someone who nearly killed you?",

        "text": "I want to curl up in a ball and die even though all I want to do is live I want to curl up in a ball and die even though all I want to do is live, more than anymore in my life. I'm facing a severe depressive episode.\n\nI moved from my original home in Saudi Arabia as a young woman (for college) and moved to Canada. I grew up in a traditional Pakistani household. In no means was I ever meant to be the way I was raised. I developed a deep interest in looking beyond what I was taught, I became to my family, a very disturbed teenager to then just sucking up and being myself when I was alone but having a whole facade of what my family wanted out of me on the outside. The only reason being; it was the only way I was able to leave the country and be my own. I am grateful I had a roof over my head, never had to worry about my food, and my dad works his ass off to provide for us as there was no life to live in my home country; especially for our family. Despite having financial support in my life (my father continues to pay for my housing and tuition to continue to live here), everything else was never great. I faced physical, mental, emotional, verbal and sexual abuse at the hands of my family. They provided me with all the things I wanted, but not the secure love, but they were trying. They still try. But they also try to rid me of everything I am. Shame. That's the unfortunate feeling I walked away with. A ridiculous amount of guilt and shame. I was not allowed to be outside alone, never allowed to see friends or hang out with me until I was around 17, never allowed to be my own. I succumbed, cause I feel like I have a privilege no one else in my life has had. \n\nAll of this, but I struggled with my mental health my whole life. Ever since I was a kid. The abuse made it worse (or caused it, I can't remember, I just remember feeling sad and then getting beat or verbally told off and just wanting to dissappear). Somehow, I still managed, despite very private severe depressive episode and suicide attempts/self harm. I remember one day my mom saw my wrist, found out, she was very angry with me. She would later remind me of it in future sessions of outbursts when she would get upset at me for just about anything. I will always remember her telling me she wished I had cut deeper. I know she didn't mean it, she has been through a lot, and there was always an undertone of almost a mutual understanding, looking back on it. Not necessarily her being kind and understanding, but I see in her eyes a young girl suffering like I do. I was also struggling with severe physical health problems. I would try to tell my family, they wouldn't listen. These health issues have been reoccurring in my life ever since, though I don't let it get as bad as I was before. I remember getting blood work done and my hemoglobin was at a 3.7 (I don't know the units but according to them it was supposed to be at a 9). The doctor was taken aback and had asked me how I was managing on a day to day doing school and everything. I don't know. I don't remember much. It was all a blur of late night breakdowns and struggling to sleep for days on end. \n\nFast forward to now. I moved away to Canada, and my first year here started off in a positive outlook. Then I had a depressive episode again, then I picked it up and decided to completely change my life. I started doing MMA (something I was always passionate about) twice a day, training, cooking, pursuing my degree and doing well at it, and also maintaining all my hobbies. I also had a knack for organisation, keeping my house in tip top shape. I was living in dorms at the time. I had a roommate and she definitely noticed my depressive episodes, too. She was kind, but I was uncomfortable living with a stranger. I couldn't handle it. It pushed me to stay in my room more and later down the line, I would move away from campus with the support of my family as I told them how tough it was for me to have to live with someone. I feel like a brat. Then, it came again. I got hit with a depressive episode because I started to learn so much about mental health, as I was also going to counseling and seeing a physician for my depression. I got diagnosed with very severe ADHD and they believe I have some sort of clinical depression, anxiety, as well as something OCD related and they also think I might be on the spectrum. I was not shocked, I always knew there was something wrong with me. I started medication for mental illness and that is definitely a whole story on its own. I would take my medication on and off at the time.\n\nThe memories I had pushed away, current events that were occurring in my life (struggling with a semi-abusive relationship, all the normal young adult stuff probably) all of it just hit me. The final straw, my physical health went backwards again. I was still energetic though, but I had stopped going to MMA, I was hiking a lot, too. Canada is a beautiful country. Then I couldn't anymore. I got too physically and mentally weak. I continued to get help for both medically and on and off counseling (I was struggling to make it to appointments). Throughout this, it was well past my first semester in university. I was failing. Badly. I have continued to fail, to this very point. My transcript is all withdrawals with an acceptable grade here and there.\n\n I couldn't tell my parents, I still can't. My father paid for those courses. All that money, I wasted. I didn't also have a choice as I am legally obligated to be in school to abide by my study permit,  and it was my only way to stay in this country. I couldn't do anything else because my family made it very straight to the point that if I don't do this then I must return home and just live with them until I get married. They wanted me to be a doctor, and though I loved Biology, during this time I learned I didn't want to be a doctor or any of that, and I did love Biology but I loved the evolution side of it more. I learned I loved ancient history, and I switched over to anthropology. I fell in love. It's my passion alongside history in general. I couldn't tell my family about my degree. They would hate me. They would think I'm failure. So I have to lie about everything. Lie that I'm doing great, that I'm going to be a doctor, that I'm in university, that I'm going to be exactly what they want. If I don't, they will stop funding me. I have no other choice, I never had a choice to be financially independent, I lived in a country as not only a woman but a female immigrant so no one wants that in Saudi Arabia. I have a disdain to it anyway. It is filled with racism, sexism, and homophobia (I'm definitely not a straight woman, either). \n\nThis started two years ago. I'm here today, still alive. And this depressive episode only spiraled. My home is all just rotting garbage that I don't have the energy to take out, but I've been actually trying. I've been trying and failing but still kicking but the weight of everything and just having depression has left me in rock bottom. I feel like a piece of shit disappointment spoiled bratty privileged daughter, I even dug my savings and constantly need to ask my family for money as I have no energy to make my own meals. Nor do I have the means to as my fridge makes me gag everytime I open it, my sink is full of rotting dishes, pots, pans, etc. So I order food. I can't do anything, but I have been trying little by little to see hope, yet I still breakdown and want to die in a time where I'm fighting so hard to live.\n\n I have also reapplied to extend my status here as a student, and considering the current political situation and understandably, an unconvincing transcript, I'm probably going to get deported or something. I don't feel like I even deserve to be here, I am in a privileged place and I have not done anything worthwhile out of it. Someone else who deserves to be here can't, while I can.\n\nI hate myself and everything I am. I try to do things little by little as my counselor suggests, but it doesn't feel like the dawn of a new day. I feel absolutely disgusted by myself. I want to just curl up and die, but I so badly wish I could just live and live to help others. I want to be a voice of reason for many. I want to do so much, but those are just dreams. I'm afraid I'm going to lose my hard battle with depression. I don't even take any measures to hurt myself in any way. I think I'm just going to waste away until I become a shell of my former self. Then I won't be me anymore and rot away and die or do something to end it.",

At first, the symptoms that appeared to me were a headache and I started seeing blue and green colors and my heart started beating rapidly. The symptoms lasted for two hours and I did not ejaculate. At that moment, I had a scary feeling. I felt that the left side of my body started to tingle or feel like chills and I felt that my soul was coming out of my body. I do not know if this was a case of fainting or death or high blood pressure. I went to the hospital immediately. They measured my heart. I had palpitations and my blood pressure was high and they gave me heart palpitations pills. When I took them, I felt better, but the next day the heart palpitations returned and I became more anxious and afraid for no reason, especially when I went to sleep. I went to the cardiologist and he put a holter device on my body for a whole day and took a blood test and my vitamin D level was 8. I do not know if this was the reason. After that, the holter device was checked. My pulse was 164 beats when exerted and 43 beats when relaxed. Then he gave me pills.

The anxiety and fear increased for no reason, as well as depression, and I had a feeling that I was dying. I was crushed from the inside, and the thinking, fear, and obsessions increased.

        "text": "I've never been anywhere more scary than my local walmart Sorry, this might be a long post,, but I really need advice. I have had alot of anxiety issues about our walmart. Let me give some context-\nI have always had anxiety over walmart ever since I was a little kid. When I was about 6, my grandma made my older cousin and I go to the back to get something, as we were walking, a man flew around one of those shorter square shelfs, and hit me with his buggy so hard that the corner of the shelf stabbed into my side, he ran away and didn't apologize as I was gushing blood out of my hip. I still have a scar from it. \nSo now I'm 25- I still unfortunately have to go to the same exact walmart and I feel like it's only worse... \n-We live in a city of 35,000 people\n-Walmart is the most affordable grocery store in town (besides HEB, I live in Texas, but HEB is in an even SMALLER building  than walmart, and twice as packed because of the good deals)\n-this walmart not only has our whole towns population at times, it has everyone who is traveling the major state highway that is right in front of it, and people who are from smaller towns like 20 mins away. \n- we live in a retirement city, there are alot of older people on electric scooters and alot of families who come in together and it makes it really hard to get around. \n-everything is always out of stock and I feel like the grocery pickup has alot to do with it (and also contributes to the crowds when they push around their ginormous carts) \n\nWhen I turned 18- before pandemic times, I had no problem with shopping in the middle of the night because at least thats an option for people who don't like crowds. Now that walmart isn't 24 hours anymore, my best bet is going at 6am, which isn't possible anymore because my boyfriend and I are sharing a car and he gets off at prime time, 5:30 pm and unfortunately, he hates it as much as I do, so we end up sprinting out of there with barely anything.\n\n We have used the grocery pick up before, but it's really frustrating when we plan out a meal and it's out of stock and they replace it with something that doesn't work for our recipe, or they just entirely mess up or order, causing us to have to go inside to fix it. \n\nI'm not delusional when I say they are so busy, I've looked up reviews for our walmart and others say it's so crowded or the layout is bad. Please any advice that can help me get through this. A walmart shouldn't be making me want to pack everything and leave this town because it's my only option to shop at, but it is because it's affecting my everyday life and I'm tired of being hungry because I don't have the strength to push through in there. It feels like someone is constantly on top of me or in the way or about to hit me. Please help",

He shuts down on me, tell me to \u201cjust look it up\u201d (in a mean tone) and he\u2019s like \u201cyou seriously don\u2019t know how to use a can opener\u201d and all around, it was just a cruel experience. He never did show me and he ended up ignoring me from how angry and stupid he thought I was \n\nAnyways. That was not an \u201cok slay\u201d moment for me. I just have. No. Idea. WHY. He would send me a joke like that? I\u2019m so confused? \n\nLike I\u2019m just so hurt right now. And I might\u2019ve brushed it off but like. I was violently attacked not even 12 hours prior to him texting me that out of the blue. \n\nAnd I\u2019m just feeling so down on myself. I feel like I\u2019m overreacting to everything that\u2019s happened in the past 24 hours. Like I\u2019m just being over dramatic and I should get over this but god it is so hard right now. My feelings hurt. My face hurts. I just want support and kind words right now and I feel like such crap for trying to ask my loved ones \u201chey can you be extra nice to me right now? I was assaulted and then my ex texted me\u201d. \n\nI already told them all these details and like, they were pretty nice to me but idk it didn\u2019t feel like enough? I don\u2019t want to sound like a weird bitch by specifically asking them to be extra comforting to me. Or maybe they just don\u2019t really know what else to say to me. But I feel awful for venting and feel awful for feeling like I want to be a little, idk, doted on? Is that so wrong? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s wrong of me to feel or not. Like I don\u2019t want a huge thing I just want some space set aside for me with a little time dedicated to me feeling supported. Idk. I feel like crap ",

        "text": "Just got a completely random PTSD diagnosis, don't really know what happens next.  Hi, I've never been here before, but I suppose it's the proper place on the internet to post. Posting on alt account for privacy. \\*\\*This became a little long, I'm sorry\\*\\*\n\nI've went through a pretty extensive psychological examination the last few months, with the initial goal just to go through ADHD, but we've went through a ton. I never thought I had PTSD or something like that, I never experienced flashbacks, any super triggering moments that that made me angry or something else, never happened. I'm also like the least agressive teddy bear there exists I think.\n\nNever really crossed my mind. But I did relate to a lot of things on the, whatever the English word, the tests you fill in, around Trauma and PTSD. But afterwards it sort of felt like an insult to people with \"actual PTSD\", that I had any thoughts surrounding that.\n\nWe had gone over things like my SA as a boy, abusive households, suicidality, amongst some other things that felt like they might be relevant in evaluating my mental health. The psychologist I talked to was absolutely amazing.\n\nI told him about one thing that I didn't have an answer to, where most of my \"inner self\", I feel I am relatively aware of, but this was one thing I didn't understand, and never had.\n\nI've had a \"bad feeling\", as I've started to call it, in giving up for searching for words like \"anxiety\", or whatever this \"bad feeling\", could be, since I've been around 11/12, I'm 25 now. This feeling is constant, I'm having it writing this, and everything I do, since then, aside from when I'm using drugs like benzos, or had in the past. Zopiclone managed to do that for me too somehow.\n\nIt was the only time, quite literally ever, where I felt at peace, I could relax, enjoy a  movie, or have a meal. Alcohol abuse was a thing too, but was far far less effective for the \"bad feeling\". It worked decently well for social anxiety though.\n\nIt felt far fetched that I had something like anxiety (literally) 24/7, regardless of situation. Whether I'm in love with a girl I'm dating with all the positive hormones through the roof, or going through something tough, the feeling always, always remains.\n\nI've heard of anxiety to describe \"moments\", of anxiety, that it wasn't constant. Still don't know if it is anxiety. It's not like I think of something and it gives me this \"bad feeling\", it just always is there, where ever I go, it follows.\n\nParanoia, and feeling like everything is going to go to hell, regardless of what it is, or how trivial.\n\nI seem to be physically unable to sleep like a normal human being, unless I'm on large dosages of medication. First time I ever slept since I was a child, like actually slept, was just an encounter with good, heavy sleep meds, which was relatively recent. Zopiclone only worked for a high. So I'm not on extreme insomnia at the very moment. Used to have constant nightmares, not as much anymore, but they come, and it's often repeated nightmares.\n\nTerrible confidence in every aspect. The outside can tell me that I'm attractive or that I'm smart, it all goes away though. Everyone has an ulterior motive in my mind, they must not mean it. I'm in this weird zone where I both need validation for those types of things, and also get very little out of the validation. Feel like everyone is just out to get me, sort of thing, even when I can recognize myself that it's completely irrational. And the world is not a safe space to be in.\n\nSuper low baseline mood, never really happy, I have periods of full blown depressions once in a while. It's hard for me to find things fun or enjoyable.\n\nI isolate myself completely, I dissociate from reality quite a bit.\n\nI don't know, we went over a lot of my life.\n\nI don't know how much of it is related to a PTSD diagnosis, or something else entirely, but it's there. Most of these did not exist before 11/12 y/o, but essentially all of it came after. Although some of it could just be a lot of other aspects.\n\nMy psychologist made the connection above, that my dumbass hadn't figured out, that the \"bad feeling\", amongst all else, coincidentally came after these childhood events. In a pretty focused time point. So we talked a lot about it. I asked him after all of it, what \"stood out\", he mentioned ADHD and things surrounding trauma. That these things were to persue all the way out. But PTSD, was still not on my mind. I was just like \"yeah I guess I might have a bit of a trauma issue perhaps\".\n\nCURRENT TIMES YAY!\n\nI go to finish an explanation of the results of a cognitive test I've made prior, and meet a different psychologist, not the dude I talked with. Turns out I get diagnosed with ADHD, and I'm not dumb (on paper) yay. Months work past me.\n\nBut, it was also, almost casually explained that I have a formal, real ass PTSD diagnosis. For whatever reason there was some miss match with a follow up for that, I suppose, and I got to hear that second-hand. And she was apologetic I remember. I look up my medical journal, and boom, a big ass, fat PTSD diagnosis up in there. She books me a time with a new psychologist for PTSD, the amazing guy is on family leave, yay.\n\nThis was a couple days ago, I'm now waiting for a follow up.\n\nI still don't really know what the actual fuck this means. What the implications are, how this is going to impact my life, if some of these things can get better, what the treatments are, I have no clue.\n\nSo I guess after the wall of text, my question I suppose is if anyone here at all can relate to any of this, if there are people here not suffering through flashbacks or things of that nature. Maybe someone has something to share :) And also I suppose I'm writing because I can't really tell people in my surroundings about this, so this is what I've got at the moment. And I suppose I'm trying to conquer my undying shame, so saying these things \"out loud\", to people outside of just my psychologists, is news for me. Thank you. And sorry if it's too much.\n\nEDIT: Hallucinations. I had to drop out of high school about 3 times before completing it due to a \"smelling\" hallucination, I don't know if it's to do with this.",

I saw a comment on /r/AskReddit the other day about having OCD and ensuring therapists do not validate the anxieties/thoughts from OCD. \n\nI was thinking about this and I recall a therapist I had several years ago. I told her that I had some anxiety about eating in a restaurant alone, especially sitting in a booth and seeing the empty chair across from me. She told me that if it were her, she would have booked it out of the restaurant immediately. \n\nI think her goal was to validate my feelings about being nervous but reflecting on this, I have not been able to eat alone since then. What she said affirmed in my mind that my anxieties about eating alone were justified. \n\nI can't recall too many other examples but I've seen a couple of other therapists after her and I must have shared similar anxieties about other situations. \n\nI don't want this to say I am pointing the blame at these therapists, these anxieties are my own and my own to deal with. But I do wonder if these therapists have worsened these fears? If they were maybe at a 5/10 on the anxiety scale, talking to these therapists and having these fears justified bumped them to a 7/10. \n\nI apologize for the wall of text. I've just never been able to really reap benefits from therapy and I'm starting to wonder if I need to seek out a therapist specialized in OCD just based off that /r/AskReddit comment.

This past weekend I managed to make it a lot further on both days, but my hands still shook badly. I offered to drive about 30-45 minutes south of us to get meat from the butcher shop we use.

So we have mitigated my fears as best we can.\n\nAnyway I just wanted to get this off my chest. My family and friends do not understand what a big deal this is for me, or just how bad my anxiety is.

        "text": "When you've hit rock bottom the only way to go is up First off CW for abuse, csa, hoarding, and ideation\n\nThis is my first time posting something like this on a reddit forum besides maybe some drawings on other forums. Reason why I'm here is for support and to connect with others who may have gone through similar.\n\nLittle bit of background I'm 21 and have delt with PTSD for as far back as middle school. I wasn't diagnosed until June of 2021 and have been struggling to figure out what this means for me since said diagnosis. One thing that you should know is I'm also AuDHD and have MDD for context.\n\nTo make things short, I came from a broken home, 3 siblings (C is currently 27yro, N is 24yro, I'm the 3rd born and my youngest sister Ce is 19yro as of writing) single mom who at the time I was born was divorcing my dad. My dad was abusive physically to my mom and had very untreated ADHD, his anger was out of control 99% of the time.\nI was too young to witness any of it, once I was old enough to remember anything he was already kicked out and out of my life.\nI was 5 when my moms new boyfriend moved in and later in life at 7-8 years old he would abuse me sexually, later found out all 4 of us kids were abused by him. He was also just a massive dickhead, who was (and I don't like using this word for this) a narcissist.\nHe started fights and loved to see and make my oldest sister who was severely autistic, extremely upset.\nShe would get so upset she would get into physical altercations with my mom almost on the daily and threaten her sisters including me that she would murder us in our sleep. We had to lock the knives away in a separate drawer.\n\nNeedless to say, little me didn't get much sleep at all as a kid. If I wasn't kept up by my sister and step dad having screaming matches, I was up awakened by panick attacks that my sister would one day come and kill us in our sleep. To this day I have insomnia because of high anxiety.\n\nMy paternal grandma was the only one who really took care of me. My mom wasn't in her right mind at the time of raising me and my grandma noticed at a young age I wasn't held as much as a mother should hold their infant. So my grandma held me many times I've had autistic meltdowns and my mom would disregard me as being difficult. My family never caught onto the fact I was AuDHD because in comparison to my high needs autistic sister, C, to them I was as neurotypical as they get. So I never got accommodations for my AuDHD.\n\nThe problem is my Grandma never really did anything to help with C's anger against my mom and step dad which would only end up in more arguments. My grandma meant a lot to me but by age 13 my mom had stopped taking us to our grandma's since she thought my grandma was only making things worse (and to an extent, she was).\n\nLeaving the only person who ever treated me with kindness dispite my AuDHD was only further destruction to my development (hence the PTSD diagnosis).\n\nJanuary 11th 2019 was the day my step-dad got outted for sexually abusing all of us kids. My sister, N, came into my room crying because my oldest sister C had told her that my step dad had groped her the other night. I had to call my mom from work and all I remember was the sound of my mom wailing over the phone begging N to say she was lying.\n\nWe called the cops. They took my sisters reports. And I stayed silent. I stayed silent because being the \"trouble child\" in my family as well as undiagnosed untreated AuDHD it was easy to blame me for a lot of things and dismiss me for my feelings and concerns due to me being \"unruly\". I thought at the time they would dismiss my assault just the same as everything else I had concerns of throughout my life.\n\nAfter that I knew no one was taking the grief well and neither was I. My family was just so angry at eachother blaming everyone for the fights the assaults, who deserved what more, who's fault it was, who caused it. Everyone was pointing fingers all at anyone but the man who assaulted us.\nI was excluded by my sisters for being \"papa's favorite\" since to them \"I was never assaulted\". Mom detached from us kids because every one of my sisters were mad at her for bringing her boyfriend into our lives only to traumatize us. Everyone blamed eachother for grieving. Everyone blamed eachother for not listening to what the other has to say.\n\nNo one was getting anywhere.\n\nI had known my mind was fucked up beyond imagination so I sought a counselor through my school who then refered me to a therapist office that provided my school services since my highschool was in a low income area of Seattle that had students who have been brought up in bad homes.\n\nI started therapy sophomore year of highschool and was diagnosed with Post traumatic stress at 17.\n\nI graduated during the pandemic, moved to Ellensburg WA to attend CWU for only 6 months before realizing I didn't have the funds to complete college. Then moved back home March of 2022\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. As I had promised myself I would never come back to my mom's house after graduating.\n\nI got a summer job that paid well then worked as a receptionist at a clinic in Seattle in September 2022. Come October I would meet my first boyfriend...now ex.\n\nMy relationship with my bf (well call him Jackie) was a breathe of fresh air. He lived in Bellevue and we hit it off pretty well through bumble. He lived with his parents since he was attending college and working and didn't make enough to move out and wasn't in school enough classes to move into dorms.\nHe came from a pretty privileged background his dad a white collar worker, a boss of a boss for a tech company in Seattle. His mom, too disabled to work and had to retire early.\nHe had one sibling, older than him that was moved out and attending school.\n\nEveryday was bliss. It went from getting yelled at by some patients family at work then going home to a house of family members who hated eachothers guts. I lived with my little sister in a small room and being both adults wasn't ideal at all, we would fight over space all the time. But my mom didn't have the money to move us to a larger house where we'd have our own space.\n\nBut on the weekends? The weekends....it was another world. The grass felt greener on the other side. Weekdays was long shifts and a hoarders house of spoiled milk and leftovers piled in a fridge. My mother and sisters fighting at night until I'd wake up at 4 in the morning to go back to work but the weekends....\n\nI went to Jackie's house. Clean food, clean water, no bug infestations, no fear of spoiled food and botulism, no fear of having to buy take out and sleeping in moldy bed sheets. The weekends. They were what I needed.\n\nHis parents knew that I was living in a bad home and made it known that I could go to their home at any time to escape for a breather before going back to work and paying off student loans.\n\nCome October last year I had to move into his parents due to my school charging me 200 more on my student loans each month. That along with paying moms rent and gas meant I was spending more money than I was making.\n\nI got into a huge argument with my mom, I asked her if I could spend less on rent due to an increase in loan payments and she didn't take it well. I took an uber to spend the night at Jackie's. I woke up with the idea to move in. The clinic that I worked at had a unit in Bellevue. If I had gone up the ladder from Receptionist to tech I'd be making more. But I'd be paying just the rent and loans instead of my mom's gas, the groceries, utilities ect ect ect.\nI talked with Jackie's parents and they let me stay, knowing I was in a bad home they set a plan for me to move in and work full time so I could pay off my debt. They said no matter what happened to Jackie and I, their house was a safe haven.\n\nJackie broke up with me on the 13th of October this year. 2 days after our 2nd anniversary. I'll save the details because that can be it's own post here since it relates heavily to my post traumatic.\n\nBut when we broke up, I had been kicked out by his parents. The break up wasn't over something bad that he or I did to eachother, we just realized we didn't work out since we were both dealing with stuff. Jackie was trying to deal with trauma they had gone through years ago that they didn't realize had effected them till he started to see it effect our relationship. And I the same.\n\nWe both agreed to split and go no contact. Our feelings towards eachother indifferent.\n\nI had to move back into my moms house. And it's been hard doing that while grieving my first relationship and my first LONG TERM relationship. My little sister, Ce, has been there for me but only for a bit until it exhausts her. I get it, my house is a family who hasn't properly grieved their traumas and don't believe in therapy (unfortunately).\n\nGetting back into this environment is hard. \n\nI have to walk on eggshells around my mom and sisters. The food here is spoiled and my mom keeps buying more food that only then becomes spoiled because there's no room in the fridge for it to be put in.\n\nTalking about the trash in the house has been hush hush. I get that working with hoarders it's very important to not make note of the hoarding and instead approach it from a point of understanding their trauma. But if I actually want to help my mom then it needs to involve an actual therapist to coach the act of removing the hoard.\n\nMy sister Ce has given up on trying to help my mom since she's tried everything and came to a point \"here. You're more likely to get kicked out by mom for mentioning the kitchen than you would catch botulism from 7 day old leftovers.\"\n\nThe first week moving back in after breaking up with Jackie, I was incredibly suicidal. I went back to the house I promised I wouldn't come back to. I was kicked out and into the house my exes parents promised they would not send me back to.\nI didn't have Jackie to text for support whenever the house became too much for me. Never mind I'm never welcomed into his home again, be it his parents or his future apartment.\n\nI have no one.\n\nThe only thing that's helped me is a couple of friend of mine I've reconnected with, listening to music especially Tyler, the creators new album, watching all the shows I used to watch with Jackie as well as the shows I promised him we would watch together.\n\nComing back to a house like this is extremely triggering. And it's hard to move out since everything is expensive and I'm still in debt so I don't have the credit score to get me a car or an apartment even if I wanted to or could afford it, I wouldn't get it with my score due to being in debt.\n\nI don't know how I'm going to get out of this all. But I hope to post more on here to connect with people who have post traumatic as I can expect will need a support group now that I'm back in a not so great environment.\n\nI'm trying to find hope everyday and everyday I'm finding a little bit of myself again after my break up.\nI still have my job, I'm so grateful for that and my boss for transferring me to a unit that's closest to my mom's place so I don't have to lose my job.\n\nI lost a home that accommodated my needs, a family who listened and understood me, a boyfriend who gave me the love I told myself I never deserved. I'm not about to lose my job.\n\nThere's hope. I'm not about to let all this get in the way of me getting out. Promise, I'm gon make it out.",

I also seen two physiatrist who only do med management and both want me on meds.

I stopped my old meds per the psychiatrist request because they were prescribed by my pcp, they were antidepressants and I have no signs of depression. And I've been off meds for two weeks and I feel better and haven't had any anxiety in 3 weeks. So do I really need to be on meds daily if they doesn't happen daily. The second psychiatrist who I preferred over the first had better knowledge and understanding even though she only does med management. I asked her will I need to be on meds forever she said no we need to treat it now and once we know the meds work we can go to an as needed basis but if I start meds now when I'm not having anxiety or panic attacks how will I know it's working.

        "text": "Stable temperatures/weather = less mood swings? Hi team!\n\nAnyone else noticed they have less mood swings when living in a place where the weather is more stable throughout the year?\n\nContext: I live in Argentina. In my city the temp amplitude during the whole year goes from about 1 degree celsius on the coldest days of winter to around 42 degrees on the hottest days of summer.\n\nIn 2018 I moved to Mexico and lived there for two and a half years. The annual temp amplitude in Mex goes from about 6 degrees celsius to around 27 degrees.\n\nAfter I came back to Argentina, which was during the COVID19 lockdown, I noticed myself longing to go back because I remember my time in Mexico as a time in which I was generally more stable. Of course my mood would go up and down depending on what was happening in my life, but I remember I was a happier person in general.  \nMy low moods weren't as low and my high moods weren't as high. I was genuinely happy but I never felt it was due to mania, it never got dangerous. It was also much easier for me to take better care of myself: I showered more often, I worked out, I ate healthy food. Here in Argentina I can't really make myself do those things even if I'm currently on meds that are better for me than the ones I used to take when I was in Mexico.  \nI used to have more energy, I did more things that made me happy everyday, I took better care of my dogs, I was way more productive and actually enjoyed my life beyond my 9-5. I went out with friends, I streamed games online almost every day, I went out shopping or to eat, I was a really active person.\n\nI don't feel like the lockdown had anything to do with my lower mood, since after it was over I was still unable to go back to the happy person I was before, even considering I'm now in my home country which means I have more friends, I know the city, I'm close to my family, it's easier to make new friends, it's easier to find jobs, etc.\n\nOf course being the BIG DEAL that it is living in a foreign country, there are many other factors that might have played into this, but I really think this temperature thing had a lot to do with it. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this also? Thanks!",

The father of my child is a complete douchebag manipulative narcissistic piece of shit that adds an immeasurable amount of stress to my life. I feel like he ripped away my chance at freedom from my life of neglect, I got pregnant at 20. I was a virgin, never had a relationship before that. I understand that I was an adult, but I am neurodivergent and I can\u2019t help but feel like he somehow still groomed me. Used me. Manipulated me for three years before I finally called it quits. There is so much more about him that I could type out but I just don\u2019t have the energy. \n\nI\u2019ve been depressed and suicidal as long as I can remember. Unloved and neglected by my family. Unhealthy, obese starting from a toddler because my parents didn\u2019t give enough of a shit to try to change it. My sister tormented me until she moved away when I was 13, but the damage she did had already left many scars on my brain. And it still has. Sure I am kind and loving, more intelligent and open minded than most people nowadays. But what is any of that worth if I feel so constantly alone and invisible? I can\u2019t leave my daughter in this world by herself, but sometimes that just makes me feel like she\u2019s an anchor. I could never leave her to suffer the mental manipulation her father is capable of. I couldn\u2019t. I love her so much but I am finding myself wishing more and more that I had never met her father.

I felt this physical as well as mental fatigue (I\u2019m not sure if, you, also feel it in your body as well as mind). \n\nThe night before I was feeling extremely emotional for no reason. When my partner got home from work I could not stop crying or explain why. I had been in a low for a while but not quite this openly emotional. Usually my lows are in my head, and I don\u2019t have outbursts (at least not in front of others). \n\nAnyway, after leaving work I had this enormous amount of guilt. I felt upset with myself that I had to leave. I felt stupid and angry that this illness can impact my daily performance. My partner picked me up and took me home, but he had to go to work. I was literally clinging to him and crying. He had to go into work, which I understood, but I just felt this incredible deep sadness within. The rest of the day went so fast.. I had all these plans to self care, structure a routine for the rest of the week to help get me through.. but it\u2019s like the day flashed before my eyes and I didn\u2019t accomplish anything.\n\nHow do I not feel guilt for going home when I know I\u2019ve reached my limit? \n\nI also feel this guilt when I\u2019m hypomanic. I\u2019m a very avid runner and like to exercise, but when I\u2019m in these mixed or rapid cycling states, I get very agitated. I\u2019m always feeling the need to do something and I want to do it, but I cannot mentally push through to actually do it. Then, I start to feel angry at myself and even more irritated if I don\u2019t go out for a run, or if the run isn\u2019t as great as I expected or anything. I feel like I\u2019ve messed up everything and the world is going to come crashing down- or that I\u2019m going to become this big slob and gain heaps of weight, or lose my fitness.

        "text": "Hi everyone, this is my only hope to share my problem a little, and I hope I can get some support.  I\u2019m 21 years old, and this past year has been a disaster for me. At the beginning of the year, I had a good job, a partner, and everything was going well... But in February, my health fell apart, and I ended up in the hospital. A few days after I got out of the hospital, I went back to work, but they fired me. My health kept getting worse until May (stomach and digestive issues), and I wasn\u2019t able to work. Since then, it\u2019s improved a bit.\n\nBut what I can\u2019t bear is... I live in Hungary, in a rough area. I have no job opportunities. I\u2019ve submitted my resume to 27 places, but I haven\u2019t heard anything since August. Every day, stress has built up inside me. This whole year, I\u2019ve been surviving on small amounts of money that I could earn through small jobs. Over the past month and a half, I haven\u2019t been able to see my girlfriend or my friends. I\u2019ve been at home 24/7 for weeks, alone with my thoughts.\n\nI have so many negative thoughts that I even reached out to family and friends for support, but I didn\u2019t get anything from them. Mentally, I\u2019m getting worse and worse because I can\u2019t see a way to have a good life. I broke up with my girlfriend because I was feeling so low and didn\u2019t feel I was getting any attention or support from her, which was my biggest mistake. I still love her, and I\u2019m completely broken because she\u2019s totally turned away from me.\n\nRight now... I don\u2019t have a job, I don\u2019t have a girlfriend, I don\u2019t have friends, no one talks to me, I just lie here quietly with my negative thoughts\u2014it\u2019s been two weeks of this now... I feel useless in life; I\u2019ve failed, and for the first time in my life, I need help and I haven\u2019t gotten it from anyone. I\u2019m not doing well mentally, and every day it gets worse... My health is declining too, I can\u2019t sleep because I just can\u2019t, I\u2019m not hungry, and when I do eat, I immediately end up in the bathroom. I wake up at night feeling short of breath. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Is there a way out of this? How can I try to explain to someone close to me that I really need mental support? I feel so lost...\n\n",

I'm extremely introverted/scared of social interaction, I don't work out, I don't go outside unless I absolutely have to, my diet isnt good, I smoke, I'm around people that aren't entirely good for me. \n\nLately I've been slipping mental health wise, I've been extremely depressed and irritable and have been even getting suicidal thoughts or thoughts about hurting myself again after I spent a year trying to get better. My family doesn't want to believe that I have depression even if I've been prescribed medication for it. They keep denying it and saying I'm \"Just fine\" when no one my age lives this way. \n\nNot to mention, I haven't been feeling the best physically either due to it, I developed hypertension and nervous system issues over the past 2 years. \n\nI want to get better but I'm horrified of going to therapy because for one, being mentally ill and talking about it/going to therapy is taboo where i live and I also don't know how to voice any of my issues in a way that \"normal\" people understand, let alone in my native language. \n\nAny advice on how to motivate myself to go to therapy would be appreciated.",

Multiple Sclerosis.\n\nNot even 2 months later, now, I get a message from my specialist about the ANA testing we did a while ago for the insurance company. She tells me that I have to see a rheumatologist as I have every single antibody for Lupus.\n\nI can\u2019t do this anymore, I can\u2019t keep it together. I have a few good friends and an amazing boyfriend, despite being together only 6 months and him seeing all this shit, he still wants to stay. But what if I destroy him and his future? I wanted kids so fucking bad but with all these it would clearly be selfish, I don\u2019t want to pass on my horrible genes filled with diseases.\n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for almost 4 months now so I\u2019m useless, in my country mental health is not a thing so I can\u2019t seek out any help.

The list is ridiculous.\n\nDespite that I managed over a decade of youth work, I'm ferocious about the protection of others.\n\nI came unstuck when I asked for help for the first time in my life about 6 years ago. I wasn't helped. I was blamed, shunned, judged and revictimised and I fought back with everything I had because it's always been in my nature to do so. I have the same ferocity for myself.\n\nI've proven that, I just find another gear and run on pure adrenaline until the danger is past and I can recover in private... till the next round.\n\nI recently (3ish months ago) got sober after becoming unstuck from the lack of support I had 6 years ago. Obviously substances made things worse and I've taken full responsibility for the hurt I've caused other people because of that.\n\nI'm still proccessing alot of horrific things that happened a year ago in therapy and I'm oscillating from rage to numbness constantly.\n\nI was starting to feel some stirrings of sadness about the whole situation when a man put his hands on me completely unprovoked in a inappropriate way (not SA) at the end of last week.\n\nBecause of that it launched me into a fight type ptsd response. The kind where your so enraged you could kill someone (and I stress I wouldn't - they are thoughts).\n\nI'm a woman and I'm feeling very unfeminine about having such violent reaction.

I can't even hide the rage (I used to be able to hide anger)... this is different. It shows on my face and in my body language and I know it can scare some people because they don't know what's about to happen or if I'll lash out. It provokes anxiety and fear in other people and I never used to be like this. Alot more awful things happened to me in those 6 years and I'm... different again with the ptsd I have. It's like my nervous system and brain got rewired to fight mode when I was attempting to put the pieces of my life back together.\n\nThe worst thing I've done when I'm like this is break inanimate objects, throw things,, swear and slam doors. When I've calmed down enough I always apologise and mean it. I think it's because I no longer want to die so taking it all out on myself like I used to has caused the symptoms to flip into outward physical symptoms.\n\nI'm so fucking angry with the person who has set off the last round of this inside of me.

I didn\u2019t like any of it. I felt like a shell of a person, and I had completely lost myself.

I talked someone into buying me a 1.3k plane ticket to another country to see a band I liked. Used them. Pretended I liked them, when I know I didn\u2019t. It was horrible. I lied to my now boyfriend about it, too. He found out like two months into our official relationship, and I just don\u2019t think he\u2019s been able to forgive me.\n\nDo I blame him? No, not even a little bit.\n\nBut do I love him? Absolutely. I do. I feel like no one would believe me had they known all the facts. I swear to god I have no idea who that person was.

I feel like I\u2019m stuck in this constant loop, always uncovering my traumas over and over again, and it\u2019s just exhausting. I keep falling into this depression and feeling like I\u2019m never going to get out of it, no matter how hard I try. And now, I\u2019m just numb. I can\u2019t even feel the things I used to care about anymore. I try to keep pushing forward, but the weight of it all is suffocating, and it never ends. It\u2019s like a never-ending cycle of exhaustion and emotional pain that I can\u2019t escape from. Every time I think I\u2019m out of it, it pulls me right back in. I keep telling myself to keep fighting, but it\u2019s getting harder to see the point. And what\u2019s worse is that no one around me understands. My mom, my best friend, they don\u2019t see it, or they don\u2019t get it. No one sees the real me, and it just makes everything feel more isolating. It\u2019s like I\u2019m invisible, like I don\u2019t matter, even though I\u2019m dying inside. Every time I try to talk, it feels like I\u2019m talking to a wall, and it just gets worse. I keep waiting for someone to see me, to understand me, but all I get is silence. And honestly, I feel like maybe it\u2019s me, maybe I\u2019m the one who\u2019s the problem, but I can\u2019t seem to get out of this dark place. It feels like I\u2019m trapped in my own mind, and it\u2019s killing me. And on top of all that, I\u2019ve had to deal with a narcissistic ex who left me with trauma, and my mom, who\u2019s been equally selfish and dismissive, emotionally unavailable. I\u2019ve been to a psychiatrist, but it doesn\u2019t feel like anyone really gets me. I feel like I\u2019ve tried everything, but no matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t shake this feeling of being misunderstood and alone. When I went to the psychiatrist, I opened up about my trauma, about being manipulatively sexualized, about what I went through, but he didn\u2019t even acknowledge it. He didn\u2019t say a word about it, and I don\u2019t understand why. It\u2019s like my pain didn\u2019t matter. I felt so dismissed, like nothing I said mattered. I just don\u2019t know why it felt so... empty. And for some reason, I still find myself being nice to my ex when he reaches out for a chat, even though I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m tired of it, and I\u2019m angry at myself for allowing it. But it\u2019s like the anger and frustration keep building up, and I just can\u2019t get out of this cycle. I\u2019m exhausted, and the numbness from all the times I\u2019ve fallen into depression is just weighing on me. I\u2019m so tired of all of this, and the worst part is, my mom never even cared enough to check if I was seeing a therapist. She doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019ve gone to therapy because I did it all by myself. I didn\u2019t expect anyone to care anyway, and I guess I was right. And when I went to the psychiatrist, I tried to explain, but he just brushed it off. He told me I had Adjustment Disorder, but when I opened up about what happened to me, he didn't even react to it properly. He didn\u2019t even care to ask the right questions, just glossed over it. He didn\u2019t get it at all, and now, I'm left with this. It\u2019s like no one\u2019s ever really there for me, and I\u2019m just stuck in this horrible loop. I\u2019m so fucking exhausted, and honestly, I just want to end it. I feel so fucking misunderstood and just trapped in my own body. I don\u2019t see myself anymore .I just see someone who's been through so much trauma, and there's a part of me that just wants to escape. But there\u2019s no one who understands me.

        "text": "Working with Depression Hi, \n\nThis is a genuine question I have for other people without high functioning depression and may even have executive dysfunction. How do you force yourself to work when its one of those days that you're struggling to get out of bed or do anything? \n\n  \nI have been searching for a job for the past year and I am struggling on how to explain to jobs why I left previous jobs. I left my second job because my family felt like my depression was so bad and I was so suicidal that I needed to be in a psychiatric hospital. So, I quit, because they needed someone to work there and I wasn't even full time and I was unsure of how long I would be in the hospital. I quit my first job because I was working at a call center where I was getting 50-80 calls daily and I barely had downtime because of my second shift schedule. I didn't even leave the house on weekends because my social battery would be completely depleted from talking to 100s of people throughout the week. \n\nI tell jobs I left for medical reasons, but that doesn't seem to be enough for them when I left two jobs for the same reason. I'm only 23. My emotions feel so overwhelming on those bed rotting days and I'm already thinking about disappearing and not wanting to be alive more times than I should without my anti-depressants (psychiatrist practice shut down). I'm stressed because I can't find a job because of these and obviously other reasons and I'm stressed about what to do on those days that your brain just wants to bed-rot. Or you're feeling anxiety about how many people you have to deal with at work. Do I just stop trying to work in customer service. \n\n  \nI really feel like I'm on my last leg and everything feels so suffocating and not worth it. I don't know want to live my life anymore because it feels like I've just been on a decline ever since I turned 18. And I don't see it getting any better no matter how many times my family and friends say things will. I just don't believe it. How can I keep going when I'm so pessimistic about staying alive. How are people even getting themselves out of bed? ",

I was diagnosed with anxiety early this year, I was shocked at the diagnosis but after research, I feel like I finally have an answer to A LOT.\n\nMy panic attacks and chest pains (what I thought were heart attacks) were the main problem as well as my overstimulation and constantly thinking the worst. \n\nI have a history with adverse effects on medication and therefore I am always reluctant to take them. When my doctor told me that she had meds to help I naturally had many questions.\n\nThe first was whether they would affect my brain chemistry as I didn\u2019t want to feel \u201cnumb\u201d and these tablets didn\u2019t. They were sold to me as a dream, they only target physical effects or anxiety i.e. they help with chest tightness and generally calm me down. When I asked potential side effects, I was told \u201cthey may cause some stomach upset but that\u2019s it\u201d. Backstory, I have PCOS and suspected endo which causes me to suffer everyday with stomach pains which we still haven\u2019t gotten to the bottom of. So why the doctor thought these tablets were good for me based off my records, I have zero idea. However, I was willing to take the risk and compared to other meds, these seemed a dream.\n\nI was told take them once a day and don\u2019t stop them until you\u2019ve consulted a GP and you\u2019re good to go. After a week, I was suffering even worse with my chest tightness and overall mental stability so I checked the leaflet inside the packaging (I know I should have done this before) and found that these were in fact beta blockers. Since, I have tried contacting the GP so I know I can safely get off these meds but I cannot get through to them for the life of me. \n\nBottom line, I\u2019m stuck on this medication that I wasn\u2019t properly informed about and it\u2019s put me in a state of mania and psychosis, not to mention worsening my symptoms.

She put a gun in her mouth and told me it was my fault that she was gonna pull the trigger, this was on video, she did not pull the trigger, a few months earlier she had 20 Xanax in her mouth and I had to choke her out and fish them out.\n\nI immediately contacted a counselor the next day after the gun incident to set appointments up. The relationship was over and needed to be. I thought talking to a counselor would help. It has but not for what I think is PTSD. My counselor also thinks it is. Should I ask my counselor to refer me to a specialist in the PTSD field? Or is this \"just trauma\"? The woman I was with definitely had a lot more trauma, horrible trauma in her past. She may have PTSD but thinks she is fine not relevant, just a side note\n\nI started walking, I have completely lost interest in myself, I was doing so good on a weight loss program until about a week ago. I started this in July before the two main incidents. There has what I have termed \"branches\" to my condition as well. Other incidents that may have been building a \"foundation\"\n\nMy main symptoms are these: #1 I can't be around other couples fighting or arguing, it triggers me and even if a hint a disagreement is coming, I immediately leave 2. A weird brain fog that happens 5-6x a day at work when I'm in front of a patient and I sit there for a min almost frozen. 3. I lose my train of thought quickly now. 4. I sweat the bed a few times a week. 5. Nightmares about guns/murder/suicides. 6. Substance abuse increased. I wasn't a drinker before but now I'm hitting the bars alot more. 7. I lash out so quick now at people \n\nIt's been about 2 months, is this a normal time frame to start having these issues? Is there even a time frame?. I haven't even really researched anything because I'm really scared to find out. Any help would be appreciated ",

        "text": "Cycles of slight function to no function in college. Hello. I've struggled with depression beginning senior year of high school and it hit full force-- I barely attended classes but still passed easily because we are a small school and people never fail. I made it into a college with almost a full ride and I achieved that once I talked to financial aid. \n\nI feel like I should be happier about this but truthfully I feel like I'm wasting it. \n\nIn the course of the first 3 weeks I missed multiple classes well over 5 times resulting in a meeting to discuss my mental health, but I made an excuse about not having an alarm to wake up. After this it got better after I *did* get an alarm to wake up but after about a week I would start getting up and turning the alarm off and going back to sleep. I don't do any homework (essentially) but maintain a social life even though for a good portion of the week I never appear on campus because I'm sleeping. \n\nI've requested a counselor, in itself a massive step because I am generally incapable of asking for help or assistance on any matter, especially mental health.  I like to think that the state of the country is what consistently gets me down, but I'm not exactly at risk for my lifestyle to change because of the election, as I'm a cishet white male.\n\nPains come and go in the chest, my mind often seeks emptiness over fullness. I had a phase with DPH which I enjoyed specifically because it made my head emptier, almost like I was dreaming. Thankfully I stopped, but it is scary that the only reason I *did* was because I do not have any money, at all. This applies to all my previous drugs, cannabis, nicotine, alcohol, etc. If I had money, I would be using them intensively as I did in my senior year. \n\nI try not to show this side of me in public but the beginning of college marked a major transformation in my person (I *was* arrogant, talkative, and now I don't generally talk in class, and I don't exactly see myself as a good person anymore), and I think it's helped me \"show\" this side of me in public, but I fear it isn't enough.\n\nPeople assume I'm lazy or otherwise, but it feels as though I physically can't do work-- I try and the headspace just isn't there. I don't know how else to describe it. It's like trying to move a muscle you don't have. ",

New sponges ripped apart, bent and cleaned out both of my mascaras. If she asks me, I let her, but I go get it back. \n\nWhen she got back last night, her dad said she didn\u2019t want to come home. She sat in her room crying that she couldn\u2019t breathe and hyperventilating. I sat with her to calm her and guide her out of the attack. She kept saying she\u2019s so sorry and she\u2019s so scared. I asked of what. She said she\u2019s scared of me. I don\u2019t yell anymore, I try talking and having discussions. So I don\u2019t know where this is coming from.\n\nShe\u2019s staying at her dad\u2019s the rest of the week. I feel like I need to just sign her over to him, transfer schools, and not see her anymore since I\u2019m the problem. \n\nWhat do I do?",

It's currently just a blocking of realization I think. I woke up this morning thinking no that didn't actually happen.\n\n I luckily have a therapist and psychiatrist who have helped me and can but it still feel kind of alone. \n\nThe only person I know of who had bipolar was my former partner and she would say I should go get evaluated because it sounded similar tho she had bp1. I can't really go to her for help or support anymore but I know she used to go on here for support and help so I guess that's what I'm looking for. \n\nI always suspected I had it but just the fear of being told I did or facing the fact that's it's not something I can fix on my own was what stopped me. Also the constant change of medication she had to go through and how it affected her always scared me because depending on what she took would affect her very strongly. \n\nIn summary I don't really know how to move foward or what the best option or what it's going to look like because I don't know anyone anymore who's been through it. As scared as I am, I acknowledge that this has progressively gotten worse and affected my mental health, life choices and relationships in such a terrible way that I need to get help.

Ever since that event I have used and abused whatever I can to separate myself from reality. During my first hospitalization a few weeks ago, while unable to distract myself, I felt like it was the first time I could think clearly in years. Unfortunately it all came to an abrupt end when my mom called me and berated me for my decision to put myself into treatment. As a result I had one of the most extreme panic attacks of my life. A few hours later (following my parents demands) I lied to the nurses, told them I was over reacting, and left. Since this happened I have confided in friends about how hurtful this out of character reaction from my mother was. They surprisingly were not shocked and instead started to bring up instances of similar behavior. Personally, I have limited or even no recollection of most of the events they mentioned. After talking to them, a few nights later I just suddenly remembered a particularly painful (and in turn shocking) memory surrounding my parents. Admittedly it feels as though I cannot trust my own memory. My parents and I have had some very rough patches but I've always felt as though they had my best interests at heart. Could these be repressed memories? I feel like I could honestly be making this all up subconsciously because of what my friends have told me and my drug use.

        "text": "I read a medical article\u2014and passed out Fainting is a common experience. It seems that between a third and two-fifths of the population faint at least once during their lives. Some people\u2019s lives are blighted by frequent fainting episodes. I\u2019m lucky by comparison: I\u2019ve only fainted once (and had one near-miss). It happened long ago. But it\u2019s an incident that stands out in my life, because it came as a shock, and triggered painful emotions. So perhaps it may be worth recording here.\n\nAs a child and adolescent, I had strong tendencies to both squeamishness and health anxiety. I was particularly afraid of the idea of fainting. I thought it would be embarrassing, even humiliating to faint. There were certain experiences, I knew, that might trigger and reveal my sensitivities. I put up defences against them. I managed to give up studying biology before I had to do dissections. I avoided certain films, like The Exorcist, that were regarded as horrific: if people in the cinema were fainting, I would not be one of them. But I also didn\u2019t want my mother to be aware of my sensitivity or of any trait that might be classed as weakness or unmanliness.\n\nI got through to my eighteenth year without ever fainting, without ever coming close. And then it happened\u2026\n\nIt was a quiet evening at home. I was sitting in an armchair, reading a magazine. My mother was sitting opposite.\n\nI came to an article about heart attacks. There were interviews with celebrity victims, descriptions, diagrams. References to pains in the chest bulked large. I never finished the article. Part of the way through, I fainted.\n\nAt the time, I didn\u2019t actually know what was going on. It was just that as I read my own sensations started to overwhelm me. I seemed to be experiencing what I was reading about. I felt a horrible pressure in my own chest, I broke into a sweat. Sleepiness, a nasty sickly kind of sleepiness  came over me, as if I\u2019d been drugged. I couldn\u2019t fight it; I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open. I was frightened. I wondered if I was having a heart attack. I felt my eyes closing, against my will. I lost consciousness.\n\nMy eyes opened. I was still in my chair. Sweaty, weak, confused, still a bit frightened. The fear\u00a0subsided: whatever had happened, \u00a0it seemed \u00a0to be over. I didn\u2019t know I had lost consciousness; I thought that perhaps I had just closed my eyes for a second, like you do when you\u2019re\u00a0tired. But my mother was looking intently at me. She told me I had fainted.\n\nI think I tried to deny it: surely I\u2019d know if I\u2019d fainted. But she was very clear that that\u2019s what had happened.\n\nSomehow it was worse to be told I had fainted than to realize it for myself. And the thought I had fainted in front of my mother was painful; it seemed to bring back childhood vulnerabilities. But that wasn\u2019t all: she asked me why it had happened, and I had to confess that I\u2019d been overcome by reading a medical article in a magazine. It seemed such a pathetic reason. I felt I had lost face. I was not simply embarrassed but ashamed of myself, as if the incident revealed a fundamental weakness. I suppose there must be some personality trait that caused me to faint when another person would not have done: squeamishness? high sensitivity? empathy? anxiety? I don\u2019t know.  What I do know is that I became angry with myself, as if that would get rid of the feeling of shame.\n\nMemory and forgetting are remarkable things. As time passed, and I acquired more experiences, I managed to forget what had happened. It didn\u2019t seem to be connected with the rest of my life. The remembrance came back years later when I was waiting to be put to sleep for surgery and the doctor asked me, among other things, if I had ever fainted. At first I said no. Then I remembered\u2026\n\nAs I said, this event stands out as an isolated episode in my life, and yet it also seems to be one of those experiences that reveal you to yourself. As I recall it now, I remember the intensity of the sensations I felt before losing consciousness and of the emotions I felt when I regained it. Except for the brief period of unconsciousness, I was in a way very much alive. That\u2019s why in a way, though I hated it at the time, I\u2019m grateful to have had this brief encounter with fainting. And I feel a kind of solidarity with other people who have had the experience. Whether you have or not, thank you if you have read this far.",

Suicide used to be a thought i had usually out of spite or complete hysteria, but the last year or so it\u2019s been something i think of randomly, in the middle of the day, when nothings wrong. I can\u2019t seem to live this life correctly, i\u2019ve always felt like im doing everything wrong, school, work, relationships, friendships, family, i fail in every aspect of life constantly, and even if it\u2019s in my head i\u2019ve never felt truly happy about myself or who i am. I\u2019m addicted to weed because it is the only thing that has ever made me feel like i can look at life and think like a normal happy person. it helps me to calm down, but it doesn\u2019t take away the thoughts. socially i\u2019m super bubbly and positive, i don\u2019t think anyone, even my parents who know about my history with struggling, would ever expect me to do anything to harm myself. But i would. i could. and i might. it\u2019s almost like there\u2019s an evil version of myself that lives in my mind and wants me to end it all, and im afraid one day i will. i\u2019m against prescription medication that doesn\u2019t directly keep you from dying, so i\u2019ve never been interested in being medicated. I don\u2019t believe i\u2019ll ever get married or have kids to a happy family, even if my career is booming i don\u2019t have confidence that i\u2019ll be able to keep doing it or that i\u2019ll make it. bottom line is i deeply hate myself. All i want to do is lay down, i never have any real energy, and the happy bubbly persona i put up for those around me is a version of me that doesn\u2019t actually exist. i tell myself it gets better and sometimes i feel like it does, until one small thing happens or one bad mood comes through and im back where i started. if i were to do it id jump off of something so i hopefully don\u2019t have to experience any pain. the idea of suicide used to be about revenge, about wanting them to realize how bad i was hurting, for everyone to feel bad and realize i needed help this whole time, and that i was nice and understanding because i wished someone would treat me that way, but now it\u2019s about myself. i want out. i care less and less about the pain i will cause my family because i am exhausted. the main thing that holds me back is the fact that i believe in reincarnation. what\u2019s the point of dying if i can\u2019t even rest and i\u2019ll immediately have to do it all over again but from the beginning. I love my family, and i know they love me, i have good friends, a good job, i don\u2019t struggle financially, there is nothing wrong with my life, but i am not happy. i don\u2019t think i ever will be. I was hospitalized for a respiratory infection (the first time i\u2019ve actually been a patient at a hospital) and the idea of being ill and not having to do anything but lay there and rest was the best feeling i\u2019ve experienced in a very long time. maybe i\u2019m lazy, so lazy i rather die than fight, i can fake happiness and try to convince myself that it\u2019s better, but it never truly is. I wish i could cease to exist. ",

I was still hypomanic when I decided to register for a college program. Primary Care Paramedic training at a local college near me. I had thought about becoming a paramedic before and when I found the program it felt like it was right. I signed up pretty quickly and began school in October. I studied for a month and was doing very well. I was acing most of my anatomy and physiology tests and completing all homework on time, I also didn\u2019t miss a day. \nI got the flu and missed two days of school and when I went back I had a quiz that I got 50% on. This triggered me to start thinking about dropping out.

I\u2019ll start, I\u2019ve always been a bit of a difficult teenager but nothing out of the normal really just pretty reckless like sneaking out constantly, hanging out with people that I shouldn\u2019t and smoking weed starting at 14. When I was 17 is when I started realizing something was not right up there. For a period of time I fully believed that there were secret cameras that were watching me at all times, in my room, in the bathroom and everywhere I went so I believed I had to act perfect because well I\u2019m always being watched. Once I got over this I realized something is definitely not right, I would also obsess over things like what I had done in the past and it would send me into a spiral, my mom was worried and suggested that I see a therapist or something which I didn\u2019t do of course. \n\nWhat made me finally get help was when I had my first full blown manic episode that lasted months, in this time I knew something was wrong bec I didn\u2019t feel real, was VERY reckless, did things I would NEVER do when stable and it\u2019s like I became a whole other person, I lost my morals, my way of thinking, I became very outgoing when I\u2019m normally a shy person and practically messed up my life in the matter of 4 months, then that ended and I fell into a big depressive episode, I finally realized everything I had done and I felt horrible I couldn\u2019t even believe it, I didn\u2019t even want to live, I was disgusted of the person I had become. This being my first manic episode where I was destructive, I knew something was wrong but I didn\u2019t know what or how to fix it, so I let my mind take over. It took me a while after that to finally get help, when I did I got diagnosed bipolar.

My manager said when I saw her today after giving her the new apf \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you are on light duty when there are other people in our department with worse injuries and they are working\u201d. I responded by reiterating that with l&i claim if further injury were to occur the company would be liable but with fmla accommodations are allowed because held to different standard. She seemed annoyed at my response and said grievance of not having someone to cover my work with another going out for surgery next week. I decided to validate her feeling stressed by saying it sounds like it is stressful to figure out the coverage and I will be available to support the staff as the cover my workload as able. \nThis is the second time she has mentioned this the first time I had a trauma response and my reaction was not based in reality but the past (i will link my response below). This time nothing is being triggered but it still feels like she should not be saying this to me and that it is inappropriate. I am unsure if her intentions are ha rmful on purpose or she is just stressed and taking it out on me and harmful without knowing. Am I overreacting/thinking about this and should I just let what has been said go or should I talk to union rep? I also feel conflicted to do this as I like my manager and she has never crossed my boundaries when speaking to me outside of L&i claim.\n\nPost when told something similar and response differed (trauma triggered):\nL&i triggered ptsd at work\nI just completely dissociated at work and when coworker asked if okay i broke down crying. I used a photo of a good memory to bring me to an ok place now. I am currently on l&i and my manager was surprised my light duty was extended by doctor. I realized I dont know much about l&i and so I looked into it. I saw some lawyer sites where says its legal (even for state workers) to be tracked by private investigators if they believe you can go back to work or are per my employers words \u201cmilking it\u201d(this was said about a past employee on l&i claim when talking about continuing on light duty). Anyway, I have ptsd and have been stalked and the possibility of being followed triggers this. I don\u2019t know how to go forward as I know its unlikely this is happening to me but still triggered me. I don\u2019t know what to do as never used l&i before and feel like it is causing ptsd to worsen with fear of being followed again.\n\nTldr: my manager is saying something that feels wrong and i dont know how to respond as I dont know if i am overreacting if i do address it",

I\u2019m trying to ground myself right now as I type this.\n\nI tend to identify as agnostic, leaning towards atheist, but I grew up Catholic. I find my mania is usually kicked off by some kind of spiritual event.\n\nThe first time I noticed this happening was last year. During my sophomore year of college, there was a joke on campus that a cult-like frat summoned the demon Furfur. I fully bought in and was terrified. I prayed fervently, hail-Marys over and over. I didn\u2019t go to class, but I did go to my college\u2019s career fair that day where I tracked down my friends and warned them of the demon on the loose. I calmed down by the end of the day, and in the morning I had to send out embarrassed apologies to all of my friends who were very scared and startled at me, their typically level-headed friend, warning them of a demon in the form of a deer come to burn down our school.\n\nNow, today; I\u2019m at work right now. I work in an office so I was listening to a podcast while I work. One of the podcasts mentioned a book listing many demons and what they do called The Lesser Key of Solomon.\n\nImmediately, I found a pdf of the book on my phone and dropped what I was doing at work to read the whole thing in about 10 minutes (I\u2019m a fast reader naturally and the manic-high made it even faster). I decided I wanted to try to summon one of the demons in the book for personal reasons. I researched the demon and made a plan to summon it to get what I desire from it. I even applied to get approved access to a restricted demonology subreddit to get advice on summoning it.\n\nI\u2019m shaking, my vision feels \u201cextra clear,\u201d quick heartbeat, etc. I feel embarrassed that I totally fell for another spiritual manic episode.

I had one place in mind and I didn't even try very hard for the application, even though I thought I really wanted it. When I didn't get in I sunk into a deep depression, sometime before or after I found out I was missing a credit and wouldn't graduate with the rest of my class. There was some shock and then later terror and more depression, but never resolve to change it. Never foresight to see that coming. No attempt to try multiple different programs.\n\nI also somewhat understand my actions now as someone who was passively suicidal. I didn't just not care about my future, I had almost no plan and when that didn't take I wanted to crawl under my bed and die. For years leading up it was like I had no future. I struggled in school like many others but I had skills. I wanted to be a filmmaker. For reason it always felt, especially now in hindsight, more of a fantasy than a reality I could live out.\n\nOver and over again I tried to restart my life but I would just abandon my plans. I never had to be afraid of going homeless, but suddenly now, years later, I'm afraid of so much more. I'm buried on guilt and shame, and fear that I'll be alone forever, or on the street, or insane. \n\nWhere was that fear before?\n\nIs that all that motivates people?\n\nI was convinced people hsd genuine hopes and dreams...and maybe I was just broken down way before I had a chance... I don't know how to talk about it, or relate to anyone around me. I felt more in good company at the psych ward. I relate more to addicts and the homeless but you'd never know it looking at me or the life I've lived. People probably think I'm just a big loser or a weakling. The few who've heard my story know how deeply wounded I am. \n\nMaybe that's all I have left?\n\nMy story y'know?\n\nAnd the days I am most scared is when I tell myself that it's no longer good enough to tell it, but I fight that.

I\u2019m new to bipolar and am interested in hearing about hearing your guys\u2019 journey to getting the diagnosis and proper treatment, along with any advice or answers to some questions!! \n\nI met with my psychiatrist and they prescribed me a medication for bipolar II typically I think, although I feel like he didn\u2019t really listen to me during the appointment and kept rushing it. Looking at the after visit notes they weren\u2019t that accurate either and had things that we didn\u2019t discuss or things that I said the opposite of. I\u2019ve been to my primary care doctor and neurologist and everything comes up normal for that, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism along the way and got prescribed a medication for that. But my primary care doctor said he doesn\u2019t think what\u2019s happening is due to hypothyroidism because it\u2019s been happening in relatively consistent episodes. I have a few other questions and I\u2019m just wondering because sometimes just googling things can be difficult to gain answers. \n\nDo you guys have a consistent schedule sort of with episodes? For example, I tend to have 1.5-2 weeks where I\u2019m perfectly \u201cnormal\u201d and then a depressive episode for 10 days (practically always 10 days), then can\u2019t sleep and hyper for about four afterwards. The pattern seems to be pretty consistent too for the past few months and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s common / consistent with bipolar.\n\nDuring your depressive episodes do you guys experience disassociation / depersonalization / derealization? That\u2019s mainly all of what mine tend to consist of and with a general feeling of sadness and feeling like I want to cry.\n\nAre you guys easily suggestible during a depressive episode? One of my friends called one of my cats fat as a joke because they love to eat. Then the rest of the episode I thought my cat\u2019s sides were bulging and she was gonna explode sort of. I was able to somewhat calm myself and tell myself it wasn\u2019t true, but whenever I looked at her that\u2019s what I saw. Until the episode ended and I realized she was perfectly healthy weight and her sides weren\u2019t bulging at all and she wasn\u2019t gonna explode. \n\nI couldn\u2019t find the \u201cpending diagnosis\u201d flair when I searched for it. Sorry, this is my first time making a post to Reddit!! I appreciate any answers from anyone that\u2019s comfortable, no pressure in providing any at all!!",

        "text": "tw: molested by cousin growing up Hi I just wanted advice as I have no one to talk about this with. I\u2019m 24(M) I have OCD and assume I have some PTSD. When I was maybe between 6-8, I remember my older cousin doing sexual things with me and my other cousin who was a year younger than me. She is 6 years older than me so a teenager at the time and she would dry hump with us when we were alone. I always was aware of this happening(I might\u2019ve forgot years after it happened) and I sort of just ignored it or maybe tried to cope with it by thinkin it was just a really weird thing that happened but I guess I\u2019m my head somewhat consensual. This was my earliest memory of knowing what sex was. This ended up with me growing up with a rather bad relationship with sex not to mention I\u2019ve had OCD since a child and only recently found out. Sexual OCD is probably the hardest ocd type for me to deal with. I just don\u2019t know what to feel. I actually got close with her as an adult but I just feel super weird now bein a lot more conscious about this. My biggest struggle in life is OCD so most of my trauma feels tied to that but I never really considered how much of an impact this had on me cuz I just didn\u2019t want to think abt it. I think another bad part abt this is the fact that me and my cousin who i mentioned before did actually end up doin inappropriate things wit each other and actually got caught kissing once, the most awful part I hate is the fact that after this there was a time with my other younger cousin where I pulled their pants down and told my uncle and I got screamed at of course rightfully so, pulling their pants down was all that happened and I always get scared thinkin abt what if things would\u2019ve gone further. It\u2019s so gross and I\u2019ve honestly lived with so much guilt from this. Im positive my family doesn\u2019t even know that my older cousin was the one that introduced these behaviors to me and my younger cousin. Just feel uneasy abt this don\u2019t even feel super scared cuz I worked thru so much of my anxiety living with OCD but I just feel super queasy and numb right now.",

His daughter was my age, and they forced us to be friends from kindergarten on. My mom never listened to me and made me go with him for carpooling.

At their house, it was in middle of no where in the woods, so big, an intercom and cameras everywhere, he apparently worked at a tile business but was NEVER at work, he always had robberies, family members would randomly die, scary people would show up at their house coming and going all day, he would drive us to random towns for meals to meet people. He was arrested by the time we were seniors in high school. He wrote my mom, and he was released right before I went NC. She picked me up at train station, and started taking me to his house. She was laughing as I cried and begged not to take me near him. \n\nThen that last xmas with my mom, my 3 brothers ditched me and went to our other side of the family party so I was stuck with her.

My mom is struggling so much and I'm watching my relatives decline, my grandparents struggle and have their own issues, I keep thinking to myself - I wish I was a better person, If I could just get my shit together I could save my mom, maybe things could be better for us and we could leave this awful period of held breath and stagnation that were both struggling so much with.\n\nI guess I just feel like I can't do this, I've always had it in the back of my mind that things turn out okay, but the older I get I'm realizing that many things are outside of your control and the only thing that you can really do is stay alive. I'm just so tired. I don't know really even know where to start to take the reins in my life, I try but I'm just drifting along in the wind..",

        "text": "Our most-broken and least-understood rules is \"helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort\", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \n\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

        "text": "Elections and Politics Hello friends!\n\nIt's that time of the year again. We have always intended for\u00a0r/Anxiety  to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.\n\nPolitical anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:\n\n**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.\n\n**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:\n\n[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)\n\n[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)\n\n[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)\n\n**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.\n\n**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.\n\n**If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services. Here is a**\u00a0[list of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/wiki/index/resources/) **as well as a link to a**\u00a0[global index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines)\u00a0**of emergency numbers.**\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions feel free to make a comment in this thread, or\u00a0[send us a modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r%2Fanxiety)\n\nStay safe out there!",

If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\n-----\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\n\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\n\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\n- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\n- \"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\n\n- Role modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\n\n- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\n\n- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

        "text": "I was in a car accident Part 1 This is a 100% true story that happened to me. I\u2019ll be altering the names and location for privacy purposes On Sunday September 9th, 2018 my life changed. I\u2019ll start off with, I was spending Friday-Sunday with my cousin down at her house. Friday and Saturday were great, and nothing crazy happened. \n\nBut Sunday is when things took a turn for the worst. We went to my uncles (her dads) house to watch the Browns VS Steelers football game, now not only did we tie, I was the only Steelers fan in the house, everyone else was a browns fan. \n\nWe stayed later than we anticipated because we were just spending time with family, I was playing and goofing around with my cousins boyfriends son and then my cousins nephew, just playing with swords and all his other toys. We finally get her nephew to fall asleep, and that was our queue to leave before he woke up. \n\nThe day had been gloomy and rainy, but my cousins boyfriend needed to stop at a redbox to drop off some movies that he rented for some of his clients ( he\u2019s a Corrections officer at a rehab facility), so we drop them off, and as we pull out we obviously check both ways and not a single car is coming. \n\nWe pull up to the red light, and while we are waiting for it to change we\u2019re just messing around with Jake ( who is the son to my cousins boyfriend) about how he\u2019s farting and it\u2019s gross, when all of a sudden we get rear ended. \n\nMy four month old cousin cries instantly, my cousin jumps out of the car and confronts the person, Brian ( cousins boyfriend) is trying to calm down the baby, meanwhile I jump out and my cousin says to call the cops. I jump into the car and grab my phone, and I dial 911 but it\u2019s not going through, I\u2019ve had so many nightmares where that happens, so I burst into tears because it wouldn\u2019t connect. \n\nFinally it connects to the operator and here\u2019s how the conversation goes: \n911 operator: 911 what\u2019s your emergency?\nMe: hi my family and I were just rear ended at a red light \nOperator: okay m\u2019am where is your location? \nMe: -Blank, Ohio \nOperator: okay what road are you on? \nMe: I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m not from around this area but we have a Walgreens to the left of us and a mr hero and a Georgios to the right and a sign for highway (blank) across the street. \nOperator: so your at blank road?\nMe: I guess? I\u2019m not from around here so I don\u2019t know the name of it? \nOperator: do you need an ambulance?\nMe: yes I\u2019d say we do because there\u2019s a 4 month old in the car \nOperator: okay they are on their way, bye \n\nSo the operator hangs up the phone, and I hear sirens from behind us. A cop shows up, immediately after a fire truck pulls up onto the sidewalk next to us, and another cup comes from another direction and then pulls up in front of us. At this point I\u2019m hyperventilating because I\u2019ve never been in a car accident before and was totally freaked out.\n\nThe cop asks me if I\u2019m okay, and I immediately respond with: I have anxiety! And he goes okay, well you\u2019re hyperventilating, which is only going to make this worse, take some deep breathes for me okay? So I start taking breaths and he asks for my ID, and I say I have temps but they are expired, and says that it\u2019s okay, so I hand it to him and he says you live at 12345 road? I reply with yes, he asks for my name and phone number.\n\nI accidentally give him my mom\u2019s number instead of my own, because I was really worked up. At this point it\u2019s really starting to rain, and I\u2019m feeling very light headed so I sit in the car, and suddenly I feel like I\u2019m gonna get sick, but I look up and a cop is walking towards me as I open the door and start to get sick. This happens a few times, and I feel awful about it because it happened anytime a cop came near me. \n\nI eventually calm down enough to write a police statement, and a release form for the paramedics saying I wasn\u2019t going to the hospital via an ambulance. It\u2019s at this point I\u2019m starting to feel a lot of pain in my back and my neck, I should mention I\u2019m already in physical therapy for chronic migraines and back pain, and I immediately knew that this wasn\u2019t good\n\n\n\n\nOnce we get that settled, we drive to this off-standing emergency room down the road from the accident and close to my uncles house ",

Growing up as a kid I\u2019d go through very high highs & very low lows that would sometimes last days, weeks, sometimes months. I got to highschool and things just switched. I was miserable. I had two attempts in highschool and that\u2019s why I really tried to change stuff. I was in therapy, on meds, I hung out with friends, was in a relationship, sports, camping. I actively tried everyday to feel something, anything other than sad, worthless. It wasn\u2019t until I was 18, I started talking to a woman (psychiatrist) and she helped me tremendously, I\u2019m not exactly sure what changed or what happened but I started feeling better not only about myself but life. Few years went by, got my own place. Working. Things goin well. Until recently, I\u2019m 25 about to be 26 and i don\u2019t catch those thoughts anymore, they slip past me. I hate myself. I wake up and feel nothing anymore, I still try but it\u2019s getting harder and harder everyday. Other than anxiety, sadness is all I feel. Idk really what to do anymore. I read stuff and see people that are twice my age still feeling like this, I don\u2019t want a life like that for myself. Battling between beating myself up or giving up. Im trying but idk. I don\u2019t expect anyone to see this and have the answers for me. Idk what I expect by posting this. I don\u2019t post often on here.

Just wondering if current symptoms align with any accepted knowledge about ptsd/ART/ phobias. \n\n I had pretty bad diagnosed ptsd after a single incident a few years ago. Happened when I was 18, received ART advance resolution therapy at 20 and it genuinely felt like I was \u201ccured\u201d for years (specific triggers sometimes but not the regular day-to-day). \n\nI\u2019m 23 now and I think a lot of it is back. But for no reason. I\u2019m aware of retraumatization but NOTHING happened. I just noticed hyper-vigilance, tunnel vision, and mild dissociation is occurring now whenever I\u2019m out at night, even in groups of people and in \u201csafe\u201d environments. \n\nI have a really bad phobia unrelated to ptsd (fully irrational one) and lately it has been so bad that I am constantly panicking no matter where I am. The thing is\u2014 I\u2019ve noticed my phobia gets more active when other things are at issue and although it\u2019s always bad, it isn\u2019t always \u201ccan\u2019t walk down the street at night\u201d bad. So when I\u2019m having my hypervigilance etc. walking at night I am actively panicking about my phobia but the symptoms match what ptsd was like for me and are the same severity of my ptsd hypervigilance when the phobia version was never THAT bad. \n\nIn short\u2014can ptsd randomly resurface with no external factors after years of it not really being an issue due to ART?

Last year was probably the worst year of my life abuse wise and the only reason I am here today is because of my sister, I can tell you right now my mother would\u2019ve killed me or I would\u2019ve killed myself if it weren\u2019t for her. Now my sisters in college and it\u2019s just me all alone, everything has been okay-ish, or as okay as it can be so far. With the occasional hits and fights and having to deal with my mother drunk/high. I\u2019m currently writing this post at my chorus concert crying in the bathroom. I\u2019m having an anxiety attack because last year after my mother had promised me she\u2019d come to my chorus concert and she didn\u2019t (I don\u2019t even know why I expected her to she hasn\u2019t been in years) I was really mad on my way back to my house when the concert had ended and when I walked into my house I found my mother passed out on the floor covered in blood. As I said before she\u2019s bipolar. I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m freaking out, but also sad that it\u2019s my first concert my sister wont be at because she\u2019s in college, and my dads working, so I have no one here. Another thing is ive been very hypervigilant because I can tell my mothers becoming manic and that mixed with the drugs sends her into this (sorry if I\u2019m misusing the term) but like almost drug induced psychosis. Yesterday she was just standing outside out house with no shirt on screaming and banging on the garage doors and house and screaming at no one. But what makes me most nervous is how bad it got last time. Last time it got like this there was one really bad day, she basically tried to rape my father, and when he tried to get away she put a knife to him and then gave him the knife and started screaming/crying and begging him to murder her and when he wouldn\u2019t kill her (because why tf would he) she punched him in the face repeatedly till he got a black eye, and then she came upstairs and was yelling at my sister so I was like leave her alone and she ended up coming to me and shoved me againt the wall, then putting me to the window telling me to jump out and kill myself and that no one needs me and stuft and I dont even know if id be here right now if it werent fir my sister who intervened. But im really freaking out right now an idek what I was lookijng to get out of this post other than to say I need help and I dont know what to do. I\u2019m just a kid.

        "text": "Dont know what to do anymore /venting Im sorry if this is long.\n\nI dont know what to do. Im married (27m) with a 1 year old child with my wife and have a small dog. My wife doesnt work due to the baby and i work full time.\n\nDue to some unforseen circumstances, in 2022 we ended up moving in with her parents. Since then, i feel like its been the worst decision of my life. I do not get along with her father, he judges me constantly and talks about me constantly behind my back, etc. I know im not perfect but he is constantly on my case about literally everything and at this point its just annoying. Ive became extremely detached from everything since being here. It actually feels very similar to my childhood situation when i lived with my emotionless mother, i use to lock myself away which is what is happening now.\n\n I have tried to be better: I have gone to therapy, seen a psychologist, taken medication for anxiety and depression, gone to the gym, and eaten better. No matter what I do, someone points out that I am doing things wrong. \"You're not a real man because you don't have your own place and cannot provide for your family\" or \"You don't go to the gym enough; you make excuses.\" These comments trigger \"PTSD-like\" symptoms in me because my father used to say similar things, as did my mother's husband. I don't know why the adult men around me feel the need to target me like this, but my therapist suggested that it might be because they are intimidated by me. I don't know.\n\nThe gym thing, for example, I used to go four to five days a week. My wife complained that it was hard for her to watch the baby for longer hours and asked if I could cut back, so I did. I would come home and take care of the baby until I got rest for work. I ended up only going to the gym one to three times a week. Guess what happened next? He came and said I was making excuses and that I wasn't man enough to make time to go to the gym more. I was done. Since that altercation, I decided not to care anymore and just do what I feel is right, but nothing I do is right to anyone. Even my marriage is extremely strained. I want to move out, but I don't want to leave my daughter behind. I know with work and everything it will be hard for me to tend to her on my own, so the best bet is to have her stay with her mom, but I just can't find it in me to leave. It's also hard due to financial reasons; places around me charge an arm and a leg.\n\nMy therapist asked me what I have done so far in life, and the only things I can think of are that I graduated high school, left for the Army right after and served six years, work full-time now, and have a child. She tells me to feel proud of my accomplishments, but others put them down.\n\nI'm just at a loss and don't know what to do with my life. I know I'm not perfect, but why do people feel the need to point out all my flaws and problems? Some days I just want to end it all, and others I feel like I can't miss out on my little one's life as she would need me. \ud83d\udc94 I am sorry again for this long post.",

So I (F18) have had a really unpleasant experience which made me super vigilant when it comes to anything sexual (probably considered secondary PTSD, i've read messages of my mom describing how she got r\\*ped and sexually abused when she was a child, but this is a whole other story).  \nI started getting flashbacks of my dad touching me when i was younger (mostly grabbing my butt and spanking me), I also kind of remember him touching my private parts in one occasion. I'm not so sure about this one but i do remember him lifting my robe once while i was sleeping to look at me.\n\nHe has always done lots of commenting of my body, i don't wanna go into detail but it makes me super uncomfortable when he does it. One time when i asked him to stop (i kind of said it in an \"impolite manner\") he got angry and defensive (literally grabbed my arm and dragged me into my room and was about to hit me), so i just stopped arguing and instead i just avoid him as much as I can.\n\nHe also looks at me weirdly; I mean he really keeps looking at my body when i talk to him, i don't know whether he does it subconsciously but it really makes me uncomfortable (I can't see a reason why you'd keep looking up and down on someone that's talking to you, like just look into their eyes?), he once even \"checked me out\" and literally bit his lip and gave me the most gross lusty look I've ever seen on a man's face.\n\nAll of the shit he did/does combined with what i vaguely remember makes me truly despise him. It makes me feel so vulnerable and unsafe, it really distresses me that i get nightmares about it. I don't know how to think of him anymore, in my head he's just a gross person that i wouldn't ever wanna call my father.  \nOn the other hand i keep thinking but what if he doesn't mean it and i'm just interpreting his actions wrongly. What if i'm just projecting what happened to my mom upon myself.  \nHe's kind of nice to me and it looks like he cares about me. He's also really clingy and demanding, he gets pissed off when i avoid him so i have to compensate for it from time to time.\n\nThe thing is we interact normally, all of what he does/did is/was very causal, I just brush it off most of the time and I think he thinks his behavior is normal.

By midafternoon I'm quietly hostile and that progresses to snapping at people and feeling extremely angry over things that are insignificant. For example, I was in an art therapy group and had to leave because the woman next to me was *coloring too loudly.*\n\nI'm usually very patient, tolerant and happy-go-lucky, when I get sick any anger I feel is turned inward. Feeling this way is completely foreign to me and I'm struggling to cope. My psych said it's not uncommon in bipolar and we're keeping an eye on it but because the lithium is currently high I'm on half my normal dose, which he doesn't want to increase back up until we work out why it's gone so high.\n\nI've snapped at a few nurses (and apologized of course!) and I'm worried that I'll act out of anger and do something worse.\n\nHas anyone else had problems with irritability or anger?

I grew up with a loving family and was the eldest between me and my brother blah blah blah. I was raised in my life that I should dedicate my life to paying my family back for raising me. But the way I was taught growing up forced me to be a loner and loser.   \nRules.  \n1. I could only wear clothes and accessories approved by my family. \n\n2. My male friends were strictly vetted to the point where my family would even call these peoples parents and tell them not to let their kids associate. \n\n3. If i was found with a females number on my phone i was be strictly disciplined. (included the parents talking to not let us associate.)\n\nPunishments for these included not being able to enjoy hobbies, beatings, emotional abuse, and more than once I was locked in my basement. \n\nMy cousin that i grew up with maybe two years older then me. He continually lied on my name. Telling my parents i did something i didn't do or said something i didn't say. Leading to more of these punishments. At one point my punishment was to go to school, come home. And be locked in my room with literally nothing. Not even a paper and pen. no books. No entertainment. All because he said i disrespected him in a way i didn't do. \n\nAt one point i broke down leading my family to forced me to attend this religious focus group that taught me basically the same rules listed above. And i did it because maybe if i made my parents happy i could get some sort of freedom. \n\nAll of this led me to be the loner and loser i am today. unable to make friends. Unable to find a relationship with girls. I don't even fit into my local community. People will say out loud not to talk to me and that i'm weird or challenged or some other horrible disrespectful stuff pertaining to my race or character or upbringing. \n\n  \nNow here comes my brother. Someone who didn't have to follow any of these rules. Who wasn't brought up with a shit bag cousin lying on his name. He gets whatever designer clothes he wants. Allowed to wear gold and silver (I was beaten for asking the same). Allowed to be friends with whoever he wants. Allowed to go to other females houses (something i was locked away for even asking for). Mother fucker even had sex on MY bed while both our parents were downstairs. Uk who drove him to these females houses while girls in bikinis were waiting outside for him. Me. Uk what would happen if i refused? This emotionally manipulative bullshit that i owe my family for raising me. Raising me how? To be a fucking loser? To not let me enjoy the life he was given the freedom to have. \n\nMy ex that i have fought tooth and nail to be with left me not to long ago and ill explain why. My parents didnt like her and at times disrespected her. They told both of us if we got married to never speak to them again. My little brother was allowed to go to whore after whores house with me as his personal driver but i finally find someone special to me that's my treatment? Yea i could've been better to at times. But i was never taught how to love or interact properly. Even she said it to me before it ended. \n\nI dont plan to hurt myself in anyway. But i want to carve my heart out. i explained all this to my family before but all they say is stop saying this its in the past, while i watch my younger sibling do everything i wanted to do. If or when i do decide enough is enough. i want them to read this over my corpse. I dont have enough money to be able to leave. If i did and i didnt have to pay my parents for raising me along with school bills and whatnot i would have left a long time ago. But im also scared to leave.

        "text": "I think I\u2019m better Since 2020, I didn\u2019t realize it but I was depressed. I thought it was just my personality changing from being isolated. When I got back to school in 2022, it didn\u2019t feel the same. I was a freshman in high school and I was already worried about that fact. When it started, I was extremely worried about talking to people. I started to mumble when I talked to people, I talked quieter, and because of those 2 things on top of me being already worried, I think it sent me into a depression. I developed body dysmorphia, I stopped talking to my classmates. I didn\u2019t realize what was happening to me at the time but now it\u2019s so clear. \n\nI clearly knew something was wrong, but I thought I was just being dramatic. Probably for the last 3 months or so, I was feeling more confident about my self. I started to go out of my comfort zone more often. I began going to the gym more. I\u2019ve been getting better for a while and I didn\u2019t even realize. \n\nI\u2019ve been looking up how it feels to come out of being depressed, and it\u2019s pretty much exactly what I\u2019m feeling. The sun shines brighter, you feel better about yourself, you start talking to people more, you think about things differently and in a better way, you feel like you can pretty much do anything. A few days ago I woke up, and something was very different. I used to get mad about every little thing in the world. I would hate people for no reason. I\u2019d hate myself. A few days ago, it\u2019s like I just woke up and knew something was different. It\u2019s like there was a switch inside of me that was stuck in the sad position. I felt as if no one was looking at me as close as before. For the past 4 years I\u2019ve felt as though every single one of my moves was being watched. Every time someone laughed around me I would think they were laughing about me. I felt very self conscious about the clothes I was wearing and even things as small as where I was putting my hands. The past few days I\u2019ve been thinking it might be mania or something. I don\u2019t have a history of being bipolar or anything, but I\u2019ve heard of it. Now I look back and see that I was just getting better. It\u2019s like those 3 months we\u2019re building up to this exact moment, and the switch finally flipped. I feel as though I will never go back to who I was during those 4 years. I would have never been able to sit here and write all of these words in the state I was in. I have never felt so clear minded in my life. It\u2019s like I\u2019m a kid again, with no worries in the world\n\n\nI think and know now that depression takes time to heal from. If you are suffering from anything that sounds like mine, please get help! It is no way to live how I was for so long. I was so scared to reach out and talk about my feelings. But you shouldn\u2019t be. Everyone thinks the same, no one is looking at you, you\u2019re simply a person, trying to do the best they can. I feel like I am alive again, and you will too when you get through it. It definitely takes time, when you\u2019re in a depressive state you don\u2019t believe any of the words that are said to you, but just trust me cause I have literally felt the same way. Don\u2019t ever think that you are never gonna be better, because you genuinely will, I never thought I would ever be the same again. And if you are coming out of your own depression, it\u2019s normal to kind of obsess about how you randomly got better one day. I just thought I might help a few of you. Just trust the words I say, and you can get better. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79 \n\nFood tastes a lot better\ud83d\ude42",

I really enjoy our conversations and don't want to lose you as a friend\"\n\nToday, we were studying at the library and he was like, \"Why won't you let anyone get close to you? I've been watching you and I can tell that you're trying to keep everyone at a distance.\" I told him to stop asking questions he's not ready to hear the answer to, then we went back to studying. A few minutes later, he asked me if I would ever have a one night-stand with someone and I said, \"Absolutely not. Can we stop talking about this? I thought you wanted to work on this paper we have to write.\" He stopped for a little bit, then asked me if I was a virgin. I didn't answer so he started talking about how he wants to be someone's first and to take a girl's virginity. Something about the way he said it really triggered me and I think he saw the look on my face because he asked if I regret my first time.

But no. He kept asking me if he can kiss me, then he started talking about how he only comes to class to see my face and how he can't stop thinking about all the things he wants to do to me.

Nothing was really working to calm myself down with the exception of music. I discovered recently that by duct taping my mouth shut, putting on a sleeping mask, wearing headphones, and then slipping a garbage bag over my head numbs my pain.

        "text": "What it means to sit with our anxiety, my take Hi everyone, been lurking this sub for a bit. Like many of you I found this sub while looking for answers, guidance, and support. I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, it is something that started years ago for me. I went through an experience that I didn\u2019t think was traumatic at the time but over time became the focus of my anxiety. I was able to live a pretty normal life though, but suddenly this year it began to seep into my day to day life and activities. Don\u2019t know what caused it but it scared me, enough that I finally decided to do something about it and so I began the journey of learning about anxiety and how to truly address it. \n\nI have found many good resources over the last several months that have really helped me to understand anxiety a bit better and to develop a plan for tackling it. As many resources suggest I am choosing to face my anxiety which entails exposing myself to anxiety inducing things/places/events and sitting with and through the discomfort. I did not understand what it meant to sit with the discomfort, I understood the words but I just didn\u2019t know how it would actually work. I tried it anyway and slowly but surely I think I kinda got it, but I wasn\u2019t sure. I still couldn\u2019t explain it or conceptualize it. Then it came to me while trying to explain to my wife and I think it may be helpful for others.\n\nThink about a time you ate something spicy, remember how it slowly build up until your mouth felt like it was on fire. Remember that no matter how much water you drank it provided little relief. All you could do was pant and sit there wishing it stop. It was uncomfortable. But soon it enough you felt it subside, still burned but definitely peaked and was coming down. Eventually you would just go back to normal. Now the next time you eat something spicy you know what feeling awaits you. If you are like me you kept eating spicy and eventually you built a tolerance. You still felt the tingling in your mouth but now you kinda enjoy it. Food didn\u2019t taste the same without it.\n\nThe feeling of anxiety can be overwhelming but it just that, a feeling, just like when your mouth is on fire. You sit with it letting it burn but it will peak and will begin to subside. It\u2019s terribly uncomfortable but again just a feeling. I have noticed an improvement since I started this plan of exposure. What helped me too was realizing that the world was feeding me spicy food (metaphorically) regardless if I wanted it or not, so I decided that if I was going to eat spicy that I better learn how to use it to my advantage and learn to sit with it to build my tolerance. Hope this helps someone make sense of what it means to sit with anxiety like it did me. \n\nEDIT: If it was not clear, the spicy food reference is an example/metaphor for understanding what sitting with anxiety can feel like in terms of emtions, feelings, and sensations. Eating spicy food will not help cure anxiety nor have I ever seen any scientific source say as such.",

I\u2019ve been diagnosed with bipolar (type 3, I think, my psychiatrist is not sure) 5 months ago. I\u2019m on humor stabilizer medication since the beginning of the year growing now to 300mg.\nAnyway, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s normal or not, but my mood swings are quite drastic and quick and I\u2019m feeling hopeless and overwhelmed. I spend my days alone because I don\u2019t have a lot of friends and I keep canceling plans anyway. I feel like nobody understands me, and I think sometimes I even sabotage my relationships because Im afraid deep down they will leave me anyway at some point. I think I\u2019m too much for them. Like a burden. I hate complaining or saying this stuff, but it is true to my heart.\nI just wanted to know your experience, if you think maybe my medication is not working or if it is normal to have these mood swings after a few months and growing medication? Is it still a process? I mean, sometimes I\u2019m good but there are days where I my thoughts are very dark and suicidal. I\u2019m feeling desperate, I have health issues now because when I feel low I find refuge on fast food, and now that I have to change my food routine, it\u2019s freaking me out too, because if that changes too, what pleasure will I have if I keep feeling like shit? What refuge or little pleasure will I find to cope? It\u2019s a rollercoaster and I feel like I can\u2019t get out of it and just rest.\n\nI feel alone, solitude sucks man, it really sucks.

I've had depression most my life (I'm 19) and so it's always there in the back of my mind it's not like I had it and got happy and it's come back all of a sudden. It just feels like it's gotten really bad again like it was when I was in middle school.\n\nI tend have these breakdowns that are really intense and sometimes they last longer than others and right now it's been going on for about a week and I'm tired I feel worn out mentally and physically.  At night I don't do my little routine anymore before bed because it feels exhausting even though it's nothing crazy.. what's triggered all this is idk lots of things. I've been lonely my whole life too I'd say I didn't have a normal social life I've had what I'd call a phone addiction since like 11. Mostly addicted to talking to friends I've met or just using it as a form of comfort which has majorly fucked me up now I can't tell you how many times I've been checking my phone these past few days like it'll magically heal me. Especially at night when I'm completely alone in my room it's like I can't put it down and just sit with my thoughts it's genuinely bad.. I've been feeling extra alone lately which has caused this major depressive episode I won't get into details because it is about my relationship and I don't want to discuss topics that include someone close to me like that on a post like this just it's been hard cause I feel my whole life I've been the person comforting me and I don't often feel comforted by other people. I just want to have that feeling that someone else cares besides myself.\n\nIts really hard for me to feel so completely alone it's happened multiple times in my life and it's gotten to a point where I feel so over it like why can't I just feel good why do things keep happening? it's like an endless loop i keep going through the same things at different points in my life. I want to feel like i can be vulnerable without being scared I'm too much but I think maybe that's just how it's supposed to be? I'm too much and it's something people don't want which i don't blame them at all I'm probably draining to be around especially for my partner I guess I'm writing all of this cause no matter what I do i can't stop thinking bad things or crying and I know the only thing that will make me feel better is talking to the person I need to and getting out of this episode but right now it feels like the end of the world for me which I know is silly. I wish it was easy being human but it's not and it's hard to find how I'm supposed to feel content in life with the problems I have.

I\u2019ve been carrying this secret for two years, and I finally told my boyfriend about what happened. I was assaulted by a relative when I was extremely drunk, and I\u2019ve been too scared to talk to anyone about it\u2014especially my family. After all this time, telling him felt like a huge weight off my shoulders at first. He\u2019s been amazing\u2014so kind, patient, and understanding. I honestly feel closer to him now that I\u2019ve opened up, but I didn\u2019t expect the aftermath to hit me so hard.\n\nSince I told him, I\u2019ve started recalling more details of the assault, and now I feel like I\u2019m reliving parts of it more often. I\u2019ve been triggered by things I didn\u2019t think would affect me\u2014like when a man stands too close or gets behind me unexpectedly. I start to feel panicked, anxious, and out of control. I also keep having nightmares, and I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m more on edge, snapping at my boyfriend over little things that normally wouldn\u2019t matter.\n\nThe worst part is, even though I\u2019ve told someone, I still feel so alone. My boyfriend is amazing and supportive, but I still feel like there\u2019s this part of me that\u2019s buried deep down, and I don\u2019t know how to get past it.

I also have adhd so my mind will repeat stuff over and over. \n\nIs this normal? I\u2019m having these mood swings, feeling anxious all over again, and getting triggered randomly.

I didn\u2019t enjoy things like a normal kid, my parents spoiled me, I\u2019ve gone on many vacations, I\u2019ve been given many opportunities to be great. I love to sing, play tennis. Went to catholic school, was bullied there for about 8 years. I always had 1 friend for a very long time (10-15 years) I never liked groups. I would say I\u2019m attractive, but not skinny rich girl attractive. It dawned on me today that I\u2019ve never felt free to be at max happy. I never feel free enough to dance.\n\nMy parents and I don\u2019t have a great relationship. My mother has even said I didn\u2019t turn out the way she meant, and guilts me. My dad has mental issues and is a clepto amongst other weird shit.\n\nI would say I don\u2019t hate my personality, can definitely put on a face to be social. I\u2019ve never been happy, but I\u2019ve justified that by understanding every emotion is fleeting. I\u2019ve read a ton of self help books, love to exercise, be outside. Yet, I\u2019m always never a full person, and I can feel that ceiling. \n\nAs far as therapy goes; I\u2019ve had multiple in my life, forced and not forced. Tried meds. But I don\u2019t want to gain weight, and I\u2019ve always convinced myself it\u2019s better to not take meds. \n\nI have isolated the things i do that depression might make do. Push people away, hide, lash out. I know I\u2019m loved, and I have wonderful people I love. I hate to work and want to quit every job. I\u2019m older now, and not having a career or full education is a large part of my sadness. That typical stuff. But it\u2019s come to the point where I\u2019m so tired of trying to be better and stable. I\u2019m lashing out at strangers, which is completely out of character for me. For reference, Idgaf about small talk. I understand why it\u2019s important to a degree. But again, I am incredibly tired of pretending that I care about a hello from a strangers\n\nAnother add is: I got into a car accident in January and got a hole in my leg basically. It got infected, and I can\u2019t even can run like i enjoy doing. And gained weight. \n\nAnyway the point of this is to say, I have a new symptom of this after a lifetime of ups and downs and apathy. Which is basically just being mute and staring at a wall. Or just straight up dissociating and not being able to come out of it as easy now. I started this new job, and I don\u2019t talk to anyone. If I do, I feel like a robot. Not fitting in with the culture here. I ignore my family. And talk when I feel it seems right to do so, for being a human-sake and knowing we need to. And there are times or weeks where I really love to say hi. I\u2019ve come to a point where I\u2019m worried Ive gone down a hole of just existing and have gotten worse, when I don\u2019t feel as bad as I have in the past. ",

        "text": "I have recently gone through a very stressful situation involving gun violence and need help/advice/someone that has gone through similar situation to talk about it with me. Flashbacks don't stop, I can't stop thinking about it, and can't find any logical reason for this event to have happened to me Very recently while riding my motorcycle on my way home, using the same route I've been using almost daily for over 2 years, I had an unhappy encounter with a reckless person with no self control at all. It started at an avenue, traffic was stopped, I was filtering since I was on a motorcycle, and suddenly another person on a motorcycle pops out of nowhere and tries to squeeze between me and a car, but failed because there was not enough space, so I went in front, and noticing the way he was riding, I decided to move quickly to get some distance from him, but he was following me. I was starting to go dangerously fast but I was pretty chill at the moment moving between traffic just enjoying the moment and he was trying hard to keep up, so I weaved my hand to the side for him to pass me or at least try to, but he couldn't. That made him so upset I could never ever imagine how a simple joke or something supposed to be a funny moment could startle someone like that. Moments later, when traffic was less dense, I reduced my speed, not much worried about him, but he caught up and didn't pass me, but rather started kicking my bike to try to make me lose balance and fall. I was like \"what the hell man?\" but I didn't say anything. Then I stopped and he stopped next to me looking very angry, and he suddenly starts reaching for a gun. He pulled a gun on me in the middle of the traffic, and I was just looking at him not understanding his reaction, I just said \"calm down man, I'm sorry if I did anything that bothered you\" Something along those lines (I can't remember perfectly as it was super quick and stressful). He pointed the gun at me and even hit me (it left a bruise on the side of my chest where he hit me) to intimidate. Meanwhile I was trying to not escalate things at all, because at that point I knew I was dealing with a crazy person and even the slightest form of confrontation could lead to me getting shot. I didn't complain about anything, and acted like it wasn't a big deal, just telling him stuff like \"sorry, my bad\" (although I knew I didn't have to be sorry for anything). He was probably expecting a fight or some sort of panic reaction from me, but since things didn't go like that he couldn't say anything, he only stared at me for some more seconds and told me to leave quickly. I left then and told the police everything. ",

        "text": "Just adding this to the void (22m unmedicated)  Not an advocate for being unmedicated\n\nI was diagnosed bipolar when  I was 15 and only just realized what it was doing to me. Of course I knew what bipolar was at fifteen but I knew everything lol. \n\nLately the past 8 months I\u2019ve been in and out of doctors appointments, I\u2019m talking all sorts. Without going into much personal detail (I don\u2019t want sympathy) I\u2019ve been in chronic pain these 8 months with little relief and no diagnosis yet. I think they\u2019re getting close? I hope. The challenges I\u2019m facing of not letting my frustrations out on people who don\u2019t deserve it ie doctors (I had a bad experience when I was 12 in the hospital for a week or so as well as experiencing some issues imo with standard of care) \n\nI finally did a few things for myself regarding relationships with other people and it has helped lift some weight I didn\u2019t know I had. I\u2019ve been by exes therapist for a few years after our splitting ways, we both genuinely cared about each other and kept in touch frequently. If she was ever in a relationship I\u2019d never call out of respect for the other guy. All that being said this past week I just didn\u2019t want to do it anymore, to me it is so frustrating to watch someone suffer when they don\u2019t have to especially when I am doing it practically 24/7 and would do anything to get back to a different time. I told her how I felt about her abusive bf, how I felt about her, and how she was better than this situation and that she needs to start respecting herself if she wants to stay in touch. Not as a way of getting her back, but as a way of setting a boundary. As I said I can\u2019t stand to be around people who subject themselves to pain and suffering. It\u2019s a long story and I know abuse is not to be taken lightly often those relationships are the hardest to leave, this being said she has so many people that would drop everything for her to help her get out of this. They\u2019ve not been together to long and I told her time is of the essence the longer she waits the harder it will be. The last thing she said to me prior to me dropping a bomb on her (metaphorically cmon guys) was NOOOO jk jk she said not to call and just say okay right after we got off the phone and she brought up old times of us being together. Well she didn\u2019t say that she had her mom text me that. (Also I live states away otherwise I\u2019d interject myself) \n\nAnyways that\u2019s the tip of the iceberg. I always tell myself it can get worse to spark a desire to live in the light, and it has consistently so I\u2019m glad I had the right mindset. \n\nWays I\u2019ve coped \nFor anyone fortunate enough to have a support system they\u2019re neglecting to use, I was in a similar position and broke the chains. Being manic helps that confidence is like no other.\n\nI am fortunate enough to be seeing a therapist. I am completely transparent now when it comes to what I will say to my therapist. The truth will set you free. When I stopped lying to myself and started listening it opened doors for my mental health. It has taken years to get to this point to be able to say something good about what I\u2019ve done for my mental health. \n\nI am speaking for myself here and am not pushing this as treatment, that being said having a relationship with God has helped. It\u2019s given me someone to look at and base my actions off of. Helpful to me because I am like a blank slate some days as far as how to function as a human being. Right from wrong, not in a drastic way but my compass is slightly warped. \n\nOnline support groups- regarding the chronic pain specifically I spoke with other people going through similar experiences. Being able to speak freely in the comfort of other people while also using the things you\u2019ve learned to help others is such a great positive cycle to be a part of.  I encourage everyone if they have the confidence to do so that you find a support group for a problem you have and see what it can do for you. \n\nOn a positive note I\u2019ve removed enough of my bad habits to actually be able and enjoy a good one! I\u2019m slowly getting into making music and trying my best to fall in love every step of the way. I\u2019ve always wanted to but that voice in my head told me it was a waste of time and I shouldn\u2019t bother since it won\u2019t go anywhere. No more. I hope to continue and be able to see through the veil that is my perception. \n\nTo anyone currently going through something they can\u2019t see themselves getting out of, I promise there\u2019s someone who can help you. There is an answer in the right direction out there for you. To anyone who read this far thank you, sorry you can\u2019t get that time back. \nBest of wishes\ud83e\udd19",

I am a university student, struggling with my course load (3 degrees), but it genuinely is the only thing keeping me going and there is **no way on earth** I will withdraw/postpone a single paper. I have nothing without this. \n2. I have struggled to make friends my entire life, usually having one or two actual friends at a time, with a couple that have stayed but really no-one else.\n3. This year I moved into my flat and made really good friends with one of my flatmates. Great friends, super close. \n4. This friend is leaving for a while, and that is extremely scary in itself for me as I really struggle, as I said, to make friends.\n5. I'm doing ok(?) at the moment, at least i'm not at the depths of any sort of depressive episode or whatnot. \n6. Everyday however, I have at least an hour long hysterical crying fit that i just cant control. I get so very overwhelmed to the point of a breakdown, everyday, for months. (This is what \"doing ok\" is to me.) Outside of this \u02dchour, I feel this constant threat that something bad will happen, but not  like an earthquake or something, but more so something along the lines of losing all of my friends, losing my (part-time) job, losing my motivation (which is near none anyway), etc etc. I constantly am in fight or flight mode, but i've said that for years, but now I think I truly am at my limit of this 'mode'. I genuinely feel more scared, tense, sad, and angry, right this moment, even just while writing this, than i did when I had a gun at my head last year. How does that even work? possible signs of anxiety? \n7. I get **EXTREME** 'FOMO', and simply get very jealous if my friends make plans without me / my friends have plans I cannot attend. (Hence why i'm writing this, my friends are going out for a couple hours, but I have to head into work very soon, and i'm here hyperventilating, crying, and feeling so so silly.)\n8. I constantly, without a break, feel like every one of my friendships (and all relationships really) are hanging on by the thinest thread. **I can't break this feeling no matter what**. I have had those stoned-to-near-non-verbal conversations with my closest flatmate where we both have expressed our appreciation for each other. I have had those illicit substance fulled \"I LOVE YOU BRO\" moments that last hours as we are just able to hang there until sober with the same feelings. Same with other friends too. I've had the \"Hey, I usually don't say this when i'm sober but I am so glad we became friends\". Yet even after all of this, I cannot shake the feeling that all of this is only a fracture away from complete dissolution. \n\nOverall:\n\n* I feel like i'm about to loose everything, constantly. \n* **I feel like all my friendships are only due to proximity, and that the moment this proximity widens, everything will disappear.** \n* I feel like i'm constantly fighting to get a break, and no matter how hard i fight, i will lose. I pull myself together, fight again; lose again. repeat. \n* I just feel stuck in this loop of wanting to scream \"FUCK THIS\" at literally every single minor thing. I hate it. I want to be just a kind, hard working, relatively happy, *normal* person.\n* I have **A LOT** more detail that would make this so much more understandable however I know this post is too long already.\n\n**I know I have been through a fair amount of shit. I don't need to be told that I should give myself a break or anything similar, I get I** ***could,*** **and I** ***have*****, but it's too constant to be continuous chasing a break that never really happens. And again to reiterate, I cant afford mental health assistance. Any advice or similar situations that lead to any sort of breakthrough.** \n\n**And again, if i'm just in need of a reality check, drill it into me. I don't care if it's the harshest thing you have said to someone i just need to know what i need to do to stop being so fucking stuck.**  ",

        "text": "Partner can't cope with my anxiety anymore  Hi all, I have struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I have tried various therapies and medications but never managed to find a good fit. \n\nMy partner and I have been together for 7 years but he has now reached his breaking point. I don't think either of us realised how bad things had gotten. He is such a kind, loving soul and has always done everything in his power to support me and minimise the impacts of my anxiety. It has become routine for him to handle all of the day to day things I struggle with: phone calls, life admin, appointments, driving etc. I know he is constantly thinking of my triggers when we are in public and tries to avoid them. In the past year or so it has become worse and I no longer go out to social occasions with him or have friends of my own. If I'm honest, and I'm ashamed to admit this, he has become my whole world and I know it puts a lot of pressure on him. \n\nI have recently had a bad spell and been signed off work for a month. He no longer sees our relationship being sustainable and I completely understand. I am so desperate to change and we have talked at length about what would need to happen going forward for us to be together. My self confidence is so low and I'm scared I won't be able to. Has anyone been in similar positions to this and managed to improve things? I don't want to be the way I am at the moment - I feel like a shell of myself.\n\nI am looking into private therapy, medication, reaching out to old friends, and I've been honest with my family about what is going on to try and build my support network. If anyone has any advice on what else I can do I would really appreciate it.\n\nNeither of us want to give up on this relationship, we have built a whole life together and love eachother so much. \n\nSorry for the long post, I'm desperate and want to do better. Thanks in advance.",

All in good fun between close friends who are basically sisters ya know.

She said i don't have to explain anything, i set a boundary and thats perfectly okay, i have body automony etc Everything was fine but i was worrying that id hurt her feelings. She it not someone who makes me feel bad/guilty about things but i felt bad, i dunno if its because we are used to people not listening to us or because im triggered (hate this word but its appropiate) at the moment.

This only applies given the fact that you HAVE overcome addiction derived from PTSD or a particular trauma but this is open to all opinions of whatever your nature of suffering is or overcame. \n\nThe reason I am doing this from 2018 - 2023 I worked for a boss who didn't do my tax or super. So doing stat Dec now. I was an apprentice (plumber), I'm extremely tough and I'm as tough as they come (I'm not boasting, its fact I was unbreakable), the company, 1 boss, 1 apprentice, company pays late all the time, boss was a narcissist, the anger the shouting all that jazz, paid annual leave 3 weeks after NYE THE FU**I*G DOG. Didn't bother me, I was good until 2022, caught by police unregistered work van (3rd time caught over a 5 month span THIS is when I mentally SNAPPED or soul left body), I used the van to go tafe for exams that day, that day I became an alcoholic, did too much for someone and left myself to shit like a slave. Overworked and red-lining, as in instead of working optimal like average society just turn up to work and go home do 9 to 5 where its somewhat pleasing, chat with co-workers, bludge a bit, pull sickies, not to worry much kinda things, proper company rules regarding employee saftey and treatement, no abusive behaviour, everyone respectfully monitored but my position? Throw all that shit out the window: this place required operating over the maximum capacity everyday, I was born for this but c'mon EVERYDAY! well super rare to get chill days (this is long story short.)\n\nI printed 400 pages of bank statements, THEREFORE required to highlight wages paid as there were no payslips; company did not do group certificates, and instead of just high lighting the wages I went further resurfacing and writing down small entries I remember in a journal when seeing the dates and leaving notes on the bank statements, I found means to go through photos, messages, spending 5 hours on separate days apart through a 4 week period, marking days of trauma/what happened on normal days, I have successfully conjured the state that was in the past as of 25 OCT 2024. That meant I was sober for 5 months and I have decided to intentionally drink just to feel more of that old pain so I could write what that old self was feeling. Bringing my old self back who I tried killing.\n\nIf I've come this far why turn back? Before you all say it's a mistake, you must believe these following words; I am in control of this, I am powerful, it's just that this particular suffering that I spent a year forgetting never disappeared, everything I've overcame is not on any scale, my instinct leads me knowing Im ready to face my past and learn)\n\nMy tax is almost done 10% left. It was tough going through it and doing all this can be reused for another purpose like super insurance claims and workers comp documentation. Making a claim was never my intention but it seems as I'm doing my tax, it appears as though my notes reliving the past serve an extra purpose.\n\nFYI: I stopped work July 19 2024 due to being diagnosed with AVN avascular necrosis. I cannot work like normal again. Hip needs surgery and I'm 33. Thankyou but I don't need sympathy as I am already humbled by my faith and my good Lord.

I\u2019ve made some progress here and there, but it always feels like something knocks me back, and I end up feeling stuck.\n\nA little about me:\n\n* I\u2019m 24 and have struggled with anxiety since I was younger. It\u2019s made daily things like leaving the house or talking to people tough. I\u2019ve been working on it, but the progress doesn\u2019t always stick, and it\u2019s discouraging to feel like I\u2019m back at square one after every setback.\n* I live on my own and rely on HelloFresh and Amazon for food and essentials since I can\u2019t go to the store. My family is nearby, but I feel like I\u2019m a bit of a burden to them. They've been supportive, but I worry they\u2019ve given up after so many years of me being stuck in this cycle.\n* 3D modeling is something I really enjoy, and I\u2019ve even sold 3D assets before and done some 2D art commissions, but confidence is a huge barrier for me. I struggle with promoting my services and setting fair prices, which makes it harder to make consistent money or grow. I love the work I do, but my anxiety makes it hard to stay motivated and to know where to start when it comes to marketing myself or finding new clients.\n\nWhat I\u2019m looking for is advice on how to move forward. I don\u2019t know how to get a job or build qualifications, especially since I don\u2019t have the money for courses. I also want to find a way to make enough money to stop relying on government aid, but I\u2019m not sure how to break through. I just feel a bit aimless sometimes, especially with the anxiety holding me back from pushing myself forward.\n\nWhat has helped you guys get through your anxiety?\n\nIf anyone has advice on overcoming this confidence struggle, or how to take small steps toward being more independent (both financially and emotionally), I\u2019d really appreciate it.

        "text": "Life is nothing but a lie Around january 2023 I started feeling slowly but steadily down. By that time I had been sober (alcohol, used to be a train wreck) for a year and some, had gotten my shit together in uni and was actually doing a shit ton of courses per semester and passing them all with stunning grades. Was working a job that I really enjoyed and was somewhat related to my career. I had a shit ton of friends and felt so very loved by them all, I was filled with gratitude . By that point (january 2023) I'd also been in a relationship for like a year and although it was a very toxic one and he ended up being a vile man, to me being in a relationship felt almost surreal since I had never been in one before, not once in my life, and I am in my mid twenties. Over all, I was doing good. So good. So fucking good it felt a little bit like a dream. \n\nI thought sobriety was responsible for my achieving all of this stuff in only a bit over a year. Prior to all this, I was a living hell- a raging alcoholic, unable to work, useless at uni, with two attempts on my back and a long history of sh. It was a nightmare. I of course knew I was going through the longest depressive episode of my life, but after all of this improvement I was certain that things had magically gotten amazing the moment I stopped drinking and went 100% sober and that alcohol must've been the cause for all of the stuff that I had to go through before.\n\nIt had never occurred to me that there surely must've been a reason for me to finally stop drinking out of the blue, almost no effort at all, after so so many failed attempts. \n\nTurns out it was all just a manic episode. All of it. All of the good things, the extraordinary things, the stuff that people would've never believed I was capable of had they not been there as witnesses.\n\nAnd then january. It all started with a sudden habit of overreacting towards minor issues. Feeling a little bit off. Kinda sad. You know, it happens to all us.\nNext thing I know, in only a matter of weeks, I was on a mental health leave from work, unable to communicate, alienated at home all day long doing nothing but uncontrollably sobbing and feeling as if the world had ended for no fucking reason at all. Soon after that I started drinking again.\n\nThen came november 2023. Got better. Again.\n\nA new job, one that I am absolutely in love with. Broke up with the guy and realized how damaging the relationship actually was. Kept on going with my career, as good or better than before the downfall, and this last march even started a second one that I also excell at (academia is very important to me). Friends. Social outings every weekend. Flirty but cautious, just having fun. I could drink like any other human being out there and had no issues with self control.\n\nAnd then, couple months ago, I felt it again. Almost down to a T.\n\nIt all repeated itself. All of it. I once again find myself on a mental health leave, barely managing with the few courses I didn't drop this semester and absolutely fucking hopeless. Last week I spent the entirety of my savings on alcohol and shit.\n\nI am so tired.\nIt's all a lie. The life that one builds for oneself. Doesn't matter what you do, how good ir gets- they're all the city of Troy and will inevitable burn to the ground, it's only a matter of time.\n\nI just wanted to rant for a bit. Tonight's being rough, although I gotta say I'm managing it way better than how I did back in 2023, let alone years before that. ",

I shut down completely whenever there's tension or any negative feeling in my household. I've thought about moving out but I just don't think I can handle it. It might be PTSD or bad memories of things that have happened across the last 4 years since a messy divorce in my family that has caused me to feel like this.\n\nI just want a definitive answer so I don't feel conflicted in my mind.",

        "text": "How do people with bipolar have kids? I (23F) was diagnosed with bipolar II after a lifetime of suffering with severe depression. I go through long and severe phases (as I\u2019m sure many of you do) of depressive episodes, characterised by my lack of showering, brushing teeth, doing laundry, cleaning my room, leaving the house, eating, etc. However. I\u2019d say I\u2019m reasonably committed to my own general improvement; I try to create routines, I do therapy once a week for years now, I\u2019m medicated, I stay away from drugs and alcohol for the most part, and I generally try to do things that will serve me and help my mental health, whenever I can (whenever I\u2019m not severely depressed). \nOne day, though, I want to have kids (ideally at least 4, but we\u2019ll see when we get there). I\u2019ve thought about the fact that my kids are going to be at a higher risk for developing bipolar because of my diagnosis, but I always thought that if they ever did, I would be really good at supporting them and I think it\u2019s obviously not worth not having kids at all (in my opinion). \nBut my question is this: how on earth do people who struggle with bipolar the way I do (especially the depression) manage to keep their kids healthy and happy when they can\u2019t always do that for themselves? How am I meant to feed my kids several times a day when I sometimes can\u2019t even get out of bed? How do I keep the house running smoothly when I currently can\u2019t even keep up with my own bedroom and laundry? It might be a stupid question, but I\u2019m really interested in seeing what any of you bipolar parents (maybe mothers specifically, because I\u2019m a woman) have to say about the struggles of being a bipolar parent. Like, the way my life is now, considering my capabilities and limitations, I don\u2019t see how it would work that well for me. \n\nTLDR: What are the struggles you face as a bipolar parent? How do you make your crippling depression \u201cdisappear\u201d when you have kids to feed and a house to clean?",

Without going into much personal detail (I don\u2019t want sympathy) I\u2019ve been in widespread chronic pain these past 8 months with little relief and no diagnosis yet. I think they\u2019re getting close? I hope. The challenges I\u2019m facing of not letting my frustrations out on people who don\u2019t deserve it ie doctors (I had a bad experience when I was 12 in the hospital for a week or so as well as experiencing some issues with standard of care currently imo) \n\nI finally did a few things for myself regarding relationships with other people and it has helped lift some weight I didn\u2019t know I had. I always give away my happiness. I\u2019ve been by exes therapist for a few years after our splitting ways, we both genuinely cared about each other and kept in touch frequently. I just didn\u2019t want to do it anymore, to me it is so frustrating to watch someone suffer when they don\u2019t have to especially when I am doing it practically 24/7 and would do anything to get back to a different time. I told her how I felt about her abusive bf, how I felt about her( still have feelings) and how she was better than this situation and that she needs to start respecting herself if she wants to stay in touch. Not as a way of getting her back, but as a way of setting a boundary. Her and I are much alike in our perfectionism and unwillingness to let others settle for less. It\u2019s a long story and maybe I\u2019m the asshoke.. They\u2019ve not been together to long and I told her time is of the essence the longer she waits the harder it will be. The last thing she said to me right after we got off the phone was a text from her Mom saying not to call her back (we joked about me calling her back and pretending to be a different guy) I realized I don\u2019t want to be on talk with limitations anymore. \n\nAnyways that\u2019s the tip of the iceberg. I always tell myself it can get worse to spark a desire to live in the light, and it has consistently so I\u2019m glad I had the right mindset. \n\nWays I\u2019ve coped \nFor anyone fortunate enough to have a support system they\u2019re neglecting to use, I was in a similar position and broke the chains. Being manic helps that confidence is like no other.\n\nI am fortunate enough to be seeing a therapist. I am completely transparent now when it comes to what I will say to my therapist. The truth will set you free. When I stopped lying to myself and started listening it opened doors for my mental health. It has taken years to get to this point to be able to say something good about what I\u2019ve done for my mental health. \n\nI am speaking for myself here and am not pushing this as treatment, that being said having a relationship with God has helped. It\u2019s given me someone to look at and base my actions off of. Helpful to me because I am like a blank slate some days as far as how to function as a human being. How to just be. \n\nTo anyone currently going through something they can\u2019t see themselves getting out of, I promise there\u2019s someone who can help you. There is an answer in the right direction out there for you. To anyone who read this far thank you, sorry you can\u2019t get that time back. \nBest of wishes\ud83e\udd19",

I have never really posted before so i don't know if this is what this is for or not but here we go. \n\n\n\nI was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2, at first i was terrified to get diagnosed  i  knew in my core long before i made the appointment as i had a family history of it. after being terrified with just thinking of being diagnosed now i am terrified that this will be my  life forever, i have always felt that life for me was a constant fight that i could never win but i kept up the good fight as that was what was expected of me no matter how much i wanted to lay down and give up some unseen force has always driven me to fight back  and push long after i have given up the fight goes on. Now i know the fight is real and not just something i was making up and i'm exhausted and still want to give up but cant i march ever forward. \n\nit's weird knowing that these thoughts are mine but not mine, i feel and dont feel this way, i take the pills and no change. I take more pills and still no change in therapy i dont think its helping i don't know what to do or what to say i always know what to do and what to say before i go anywhere i have to that's how i survived this long.\n\nWhen will i see the light at the end, is there even a light at the end. everything i keep reading says it gets worse as you age and here i am at 31 just getting diagnosed and looking back i can see that i have been dealing with this since i was 11 and i didnt have help no one knew i didn't even know i just found ways to work around it and make situations work for me or found ways to avoid them if i knew i couldn't make it work. \n\nI hold myself to such a high standard i wonder does this diagnoses even matter i have been pushing through it for this long what's the rest of my life anyways really if i can make it this long i can make it to the end right?\n\nmaybe it's not real maybe i am just saying all the right buzz words regurgitating them back like a parrot and making everyone else believe that i am bipolar but what if i am not and i'm just fooling everyone around me.\n\n  \ni still don't even understand what this means bipolar 2 i have googled and read a millions posts that all seem like stories of my own and it almost convinced me maybe they are right maybe this is the answer and maybe the end is in sight and i can be normal. that's all i have ever wanted was to be normal that's why i work so hard to pretend and be the person everyone expects i put on the mask and everything is ok.\n\ni just want to be normal is that ever going to happen and if it does am i going to miss myself like so many others i have seen post?\n\ni'm sorry i just had to share with someone anyone really i don't know if i want answers or not but just writing this out has made me feel better. \n\n  \nPlease share with me how you felt when you found out, i would love to hear how others have coped with this and maybe i can find some peace in responses. \n\n",

My mother has borderline personality disorder and father exhibits all narcissistic personality disorder traits but does not have an official diagnosis. I personally have ADHD, PMDD, GA, and some C-PTSD. I often get extremely triggered by my parents and have a hard time calming my emotions and urges. \n\nRecently (like within the past few years) I\u2019ve started realizing how much my parents manipulate and use me in their wars against each other or for their favor. Safe to say I\u2019ve started resenting them heavily for it as my reliance on them has decreased. I\u2019ve started fighting back a lot.\n\nA terrifying urge I\u2019ve developed when frustrated is to bite them. Like sink my teeth into them to get them to shut up? I\u2019ve never done it and don\u2019t plan to but when I start seeing red it becomes really hard to control. It\u2019s kind of insane and I\u2019m terrified and grossed out by this but genuinely thinking it\u2019s a trauma response.\n\nBut I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m wrong and it might be a precursor to abuse or my propensity to want to abuse others if I get angry at them but don\u2019t know if this is just standard reactionary abuse behavior. \n\nI also worry (as insane as it sounds) that it might have something to do with cannibalism?

My psychiatrist is notorious for thinking I\u2019m fine and not in need of a medication change even when I\u2019m describing manic/probably problematic behavior like buying a $400/month car when a beater would have done fine. Racking up $10K in credit card debt in less than a year. He asks about my sleep; I say I haven\u2019t been sleeping as much, but mostly just because I am overwhelmed by parenting and want to have some quiet \u201cme\u201d time at the end of the day. So, about 2 days a week I\u2019ll skip my sedating meds and stay up late or not sleep at all. He asks, \u201cBut when you want to sleep, can you sleep?\u201d I say yes, and he says, \u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re fine.\u201d He explains that it\u2019s really only a problem when you want to sleep but can\u2019t because your mind won\u2019t slow down. Makes sense I guess. I\u2019m just surprised he\u2019s not concerned by someone who is describing a decreased need for sleep.\n\nI was surprised too because we\u2019re always taught how important medication adherence is with this illness, yet my psychiatrist was seemingly unconcerned by me skipping doses here and there. If taking my mood stabilizing medications 71-86% of the time is good enough to maintain a stable mood \u2014 and my experience proves this to be true, at least for me \u2014 why was I freaking out about missing a lousy pill of Lamictal back in the day? \n\nThis is the same guy who felt free to inform me that I am damaging my child by making her an only child. He asserted that subjecting your child to life as an only child is the worst thing you could possibly do for their development. I\u2019ve been seeing him for a long time though and I\u2019m (mostly) stable so I guess we\u2019re not doing too badly. It\u2019s just interesting to me that I can think I have problematic behaviors yet run them by him and he\u2019s like, nah, you\u2019re good.

Maybe because I\u2019m a virgin idk\u2026.. I ended up thinking like if I do something sexual with a couple guys I will just be healed. My trauma won\u2019t matter anymore.

It just made it worse because now I just did these things to make myself like feel anything else and to lower the value of what was stolen from me\u2026.\n\n  He didn\u2019t exactly take my virginity . He \u201cjust\u201d SA me over my clothes, so I feel dramatic being this upset about it, but the way I see it that was my first experience.

I feel so crazy like why is this so traumatizing ? Will I ever feel better and heal from this ? \n\n  I feel guilty too even wanting a normal sex life after that even wanting something that was so traumatic for me that was so disgustingly like\u2026. forced so now I feel guilty that I\u2019m even curious to know what normal sex is like.\n\n  I\u2019m just so depressed.

The result is that I feel like I'm under scrutiny all the time, because I feel like she don't respect me or trust me. \nThere's times I feel micromanaged and it's very disheartening.\n\nI'll admit I do dumb shit sometimes, but the problem is that if I'm under scrutiny, I overthink. When I overthink I make mistakes; and it's a repeating cycle and a self fulfilling prophecy \n\nI don't know how to resolve this because I can't expect her to just suddenly trust me, but I do want her to not automatically assume that I'm being an idiot. \n\nIt's really depressing because I know I'm no more of an idiot than the next man but then I feel like I'm useless\n\nIt's not just that either, one thing that's been causing a big problem is the fact that my hearing isn't great. It's got not much to do with actual hearing as it does with ADHD. When I discussed it with my doctor we discussed the possibility that I might have auditory processing disorder - which is part of ADHD- where you can have good hearing but if you have background noise, you're concentrating on something, or anything else that could distract you you just don't hear other things. \nWe went bowling tonight and the music was very loud but she would talk at a normal level, so I didn't have a hope of hearing and kept asking her to repeat herself so she stopped bothering to talk to me at all so we ended up bowling in all but silence and it was utterly crushing\n\n\nIt's really hard because we both love each other so much but she just doesn't respect me and I'm really struggling to work out how to address this with her",

        "text": " My first sexual experience was SA and it\u2019s ruined me\u2026.     My Story \n\n  This guy I had only been on a couple dates with\u2026.  This was the third date, but we had talked on the phone that\u2019s it though 3 months. I told him I never did anything sexually I\u2019m a virgin basically a \u201cgood girl\u201d for lack of better words.  And I was raised like that sex should be if I\u2019m in love or preferably I should be married. At least I should know the guy really well. Besides that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with sex. I wasn\u2019t taught much about it. I was taught it was bad pretty much and I didn\u2019t know it was even normal for women to have urges ? So you get how I felt about it mentally emotionally. Though I did think from the beginning wow I feel like eventually I will have to because he was pressuring me, but too subtly for me to think much of it\u2026.. but whenever he brought it up I got uncomfortable (like our second date and he said I\u2019d never pressure you or anything and you wouldn\u2019t do it out of guilt right? Then he just said hey I really like you\u2026. Anyway I only knew him in person for three days before he sexually assaulted me. It was our first day literally first day of dating. \n\n    So here\u2019s what happened\u2026\u2026 we were in his car as he pulled into the driveway to his house. I kept saying I\u2019m looking for somewhere to go and he just ignored me. He suggested we go back inside his house and \u201chang out\u201d. Stupidly I believed him. He also casually says \u201coh hey my Uncles here\u201d. \n\n    I don\u2019t go inside at first but eventually I do and thinking we\u2019re gonna hang out. So at first we were just kissing \u2026\u2026. but then he started I guess grinding on me ? I didn\u2019t know what it was even called at the time or I might\u2019ve just left, but I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time and he seemed nice enough. And I got really nervous. I said I had to go to the bathroom then went back like nah he doesn\u2019t realize so I just have to tell him. So I tell him I\u2019m really nervous I need to breathe. I do want to kiss you though.\n\n  So he goes back to kissing me but how he\u2019s doing it is more\u2026. Intense so I have a panic attack . Eventually he pulled away and just went and sat on the other side of his bed ignoring me.\n\n   He just completely ignored me he wouldn\u2019t even look at me. I kept trying to tell him I was nervous again like I said. He sighs really loudly and like an idiot I ask what ? What\u2019s wrong ? Then he doesn\u2019t say anything again and just sighs irritated. Nervously I ask \u201cwhat ? What do you want ? He then gets in my face and says I WANT you\u2026\u2026. (Empasizing the want) Then whispers to stop in MY EAR and goes back to kissing me even though I wasn\u2019t and gets ontop of me again trying to kiss my neck.\n\n  His Uncle walks in and asks if I\u2019m okay because we\u2019re kissing but he\u2019s touching me groping me actually grabbing my boobs my ass and I\u2019m literally doing nothing back but kissing him. I\u2019m embarrassed and my face is getting red cuz I feel embarrassed about that so I say I\u2019m okay and then he leaves and talks to his uncle\u2026\u2026\n\n  Then he comes back and says \u201cNow\u2026.. where were we ?\u201d And I don\u2019t like how he says it but I feel insecure and I keep thinking maybe I should just touch him back like he wants even though it\u2019s because he said he wanted me to stop sarcastically and even threateningly so at first I do. \n\n  Then he tries grinding on me again and I completely pull away and stop kissing him I stop like everything. I\u2019m just looking down at what he tried to do again and I\u2019m in shock. I wanted to say something but the way he said \u201c stop \u201c was so aggressive and it made me feel guilty and afraid, but again I just kept telling myself it\u2019s fine I\u2019m overthinking it he\u2019s nice. \n\n  Then he looks down also looks at me sighs and then grabs me and kisses me I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t really think I need to scream and I\u2019m getting afraid cuz I\u2019m not grabbing him back, but either way he\u2019s kissing me so aggressively not moving away from my face that I do back just because he\u2019s freaking me out and I don\u2019t want to offend him. So I think maybe if I don\u2019t put my hands on him. So I don\u2019t . The weird thing is idk maybe I\u2019m overthinking it but he had grabbed and just kissed me before too and in his room, so why would I think the situation would get dangerous? \n\n  Then he just gets on my legs with his knees and I can\u2019t move. We still have our clothes on. He just literally sits on my legs with his knees and I can\u2019t move. I think does he realize he\u2019s crushing my legs. I wanna scream but I just freeze. I can\u2019t move.  I don\u2019t care what anyone says idk how to describe it but simulating \u201crough sex\u201d except I didn\u2019t consent so it simulated something different almost for me that seems more accurate than saying it was dry humping because that\u2019s when two people are doing it. This was not that. To me it was just violating and abuse. I mean I couldn\u2019t move I didn\u2019t move once. \n\n  At all. \n\n    Then he proceeds to aggressively hump me until he finishes\u2026\u2026 all while I can not move (tonic immobility) like freezing in fear cuz of him getting on my legs and I dissacociated\u2026\u2026 but it was HOW he did it he seemed mad at me and he was aggressive. And it was kind of roughly\u2026\u2026. how he did it though thankfully wasn\u2019t injured not to that point. He made me feel his groin area\u2026.. many times\u2026. Through the clothing. He forced my body to react then just finished\u2026\u2026. But after a long ass time n mind you I was HELD DOWN during this. He even TOOK BREAKS. And he kept getting ontop of me while he did this. It was terrifying I tried like if I just look away never look at him maybe he\u2019ll stop. He didn\u2019t.  Even though it was aggressive dry humping I mean I was dissacociated and I froze and it sounded wrong so to be completely honest to ME from MY perspective at first I thought \u201c oh god it sounds like I\u2019m being raped\u201d and it did because he was roughly doing it without my consent and it didn\u2019t sound right. It literally sounded forced, but my mind just went somewhere else though I partly had awareness of what was going on. And it took time to even figure out what was going on because I had never done anything at all sexually, so I was really scared. Emotionally though I just felt dead inside: empty. I felt like a fucking toy and he was using my body to\u2026\u2026 you know. And I was just there frozen unable to move. :( \n\n  I know he didn\u2019t rape me or anything n I\u2019m grateful it was at least over our clothes but here\u2019s the thing : I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING I HAD NO SEXUAL EXPERIENCE  and I\u2019M A VIRGIN so to me it was horrifyingly close to something else or am I being dramatic ? I know it\u2019s not even actual sex. I\u2019m traumatized though. It still gave me PTSD.  And some fucking weird kinks and affected my sexuality amongst other issues\u2026.. .-.\n\n  I should mention honestly I wasn\u2019t ready at all. I could see myself having been ready like 20\u2019s like early 20\u2019s . I was 19 at the time. It really hurts this being my first experience. Plus it makes dating just a nightmare. Especially being a bit promiscuous after this for a while just to make myself feel better like the more experienced I am, the less this matters. That isn\u2019t helping though so now I just probably need therapy first before I do anything related cuz it just reminds me of my assault\u2026..",

Am I the only one who dives headfirst into relationships when I\u2019m manic?\n\nFor a long time, I knew something wasn\u2019t right inside me, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. It wasn\u2019t until I went to therapy and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 19 that it started to make sense. Now, at 23, I can see how each of my three relationships was really a way to distract myself from the chaos in my mind. I\u2019ve been carrying the weight of sexual trauma, too, which has made me hypersexual. When I look back, I realize I didn\u2019t genuinely love any of them\u2014I was just convincing myself that I did, maybe because I was so scared of being alone or facing my own pain.\n\nEach relationship turned toxic, one after the other. I know I had a part in it. I forced myself to believe they were everything, that I loved them, and I depended on them so heavily that it was like I couldn\u2019t breathe without them. Every day, my mood and self-worth revolved around them. And then, when things ended, it felt like my whole world shattered. I\u2019d be left sleepless, unable to eat, and begging to be taken back, calling them constantly because I couldn\u2019t bear the emptiness. Looking back now, I see it wasn\u2019t love\u2014it was this unhealthy, all-consuming obsession, fueled by this desperate need to feel close to someone, anyone.\n\nRight now, it feels unbearable. I just got out of another relationship a month ago, and even though I chased him and poured so much into it, now I hate him, and I hate myself for even being with him. The regret is overwhelming. I feel like I don\u2019t even know what real love is, like maybe I\u2019m just broken inside, doomed to keep repeating this painful cycle. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, but this disorder is tearing me apart. Does anyone feel this way ? It\u2019s like meeting someone and they quickly become your whole world. You get so attached, so wrapped up in them that every part of who they are feels perfect, like they were meant for you. The obsession runs deep\u2014you love every detail, every moment, and it feels like you couldn\u2019t live without them. But the second they hurt you, it\u2019s like a switch flips. Suddenly, everything you once adored about them turns into something you resent. That connection that felt so intense turns painful, and all those little things you loved now just remind you of the hurt.\n\nIt\u2019s a cycle of extreme highs and lows, where love feels all-consuming one minute, and then the next, you\u2019re filled with anger and regret. It\u2019s such a confusing and exhausting way to love because every moment feels like everything\u2014until it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s like everything felt so real, but looking back, it was all built on lust and attraction. The connection felt intense, almost overwhelming, but maybe it was just the rush, the thrill, and not a deeper bond. I think I was seeing something that wasn\u2019t really there\u2014just creating a version of them in my mind that I wanted to believe in.\n\nMaybe I was just caught up, delusional, and manic, swept away in the high of it all.

        "text": "When should a person go to a psychiatric hospital? So about a week ago I started a new anti depressant. It made me very sick, like to the point where I was shaking, drenched in sweat, diarrhea, and having panic attacks. I was also feeling very depressed and suicidal. I almost called an ambulance but was able to make it to the hospital on my own. My dr switched my medication and today the same thing happened. I had to stop working because I felt the same symptoms and started dry heaving until I took a sip of water and threw up. I checked my bp using the machine in the break room and it was 142/81 and my heart rate was 112, so I left and went to urgent treatment. \n\nNow I\u2019m contemplating on if I should go to psychiatric in patient or not. I\u2019m to the point where I\u2019m terrified of taking another new antidepressant. I also can\u2019t keep leaving work early because of a reaction to my medication. Personally I would like to take an fmla leave until I can get my medication figured out, however I\u2019m not qualified because I haven\u2019t been at my current job for 12 months. I feel like going in patient would be good because they could try different medications and I\u2019d be somewhere safe if something were to happen again. It\u2019s also an excused absence from work. However, I feel like mentally I\u2019m just not at a point where I feel like I\u2019m a threat to myself or others. Most of the time I feel fine (still depressed but overall fine) mentally, but it\u2019s when I\u2019m having severe reactions to my medication that I feel like I want to die. \n\nIf anyone could help point me in the right direction, I would be very appreciative. Thank you for reading my yap session.\n\n",

I don\u2019t wanna look at that kitchen anymore.\nMy girlfriend left me and I\u2019ve been a depressed anxious wreck.\nI got put on SSRIs this week, and I\u2019m getting better but I still fucking hate my job.\n\nI felt this way about my old job after Covid hit and screwed everything up and I was there for four years.\nIt\u2019s like I associate it forever now with that one really bad week and it feels like every time I clock in I\u2019m reliving it all over again. \nI\u2019ve been applying for new jobs but not going to any interviews because I can\u2019t tell if I really want to leave or if my brain is just doing some weird glitch.

I have since been medicated and have been \u201cstable\u201d, not experiencing anything more severe than the occasional hypomania and rapid cycling.\n\nI just started dating someone who I met three months ago. We have been communicating really well on what we\u2019re looking for and our needs/desires in a potential relationship. We\u2019re both in our early-mid twenties and lesbians, not that it really matters. \n\nYesterday, I opened up about having Bipolar letting them know how I process my emotions, why it\u2019s important to me that someone I date knows this and understands what bipolar is (my last partner thought bipolar and BPD were the same thing and they were a psychology major\u2026), and also asked them to think about this to reflect on whether or not they want to date someone with bipolar.\n\nThey\u2019ve been so receptive and empathetic to this point, so I was expecting a comforting reaction. As assumptions tend to be, that was a bit off course. Instead, they told me about how they have always had fears of \u201cgoing crazy\u201d (their words, not mine) and have anxiety around the thought of \u201cgetting locked up\u201d. They don\u2019t suffer from any severe mental illness, so I guess this comes from a combination of societal messages and the fear around existential thinking.\n\nANYWAYS, they further went on to say that they could not be a person to support someone in a manic state of mind, basically. I wasn\u2019t expecting that, I am very independent and try to seek my main support through my therapist and safety network I\u2019ve built, but I\u2019m worried that this person will be afraid of me if I do ever have a manic episode while dating.\n\nIs this person safe to date? what do you look in a partner to be supportive of you?

After being diagnosed and hospitalised in 2018, I've struggled to find other people with similar diagnoses locally and I really think the best way to manage this tumultuous illness is through connection. I volunteer as a mental health advocate now and have learnt a little bit about managing triggers and moderating my behaviours. Some days are still extreme though, even with medication and talking therapies. I think the times I've felt best are when I've connected with another person whose story I can identify with. Through our unique experiences on psych wards, navigating the minefield of MH services and trying to maintain balance we already share a connection. Hopefully in this sub real friendships with like minded people can be formed, and we can all help one another as best we can. Stay safe, stay connected and be kind.",

And honestly, the stigma around it makes it even harder. People hear \"bipolar\" and immediately think you're unpredictable, dangerous, or incapable of living a normal life. It's exhausting.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, bipolar disorder isn\u2019t just \u201cmood swings.\u201d It\u2019s an overwhelming cycle of highs and lows. The manic episodes can make you feel invincible, like you can conquer the world in a single day\u2014but it\u2019s also the time you make impulsive decisions that can wreak havoc on your life. And then there\u2019s the crash: the depressive episodes where getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse? Trying to explain this to people who don\u2019t understand. They\u2019ll say, \u201cWe all have bad days,\u201d or \u201cJust think positive!\u201d As if **bipolar depression** is the same as being in a bad mood. Spoiler: it\u2019s not.\n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the fear of judgment. It feels like society has slapped a giant label on me that says \"unstable.\" Employers hesitate, friends drift away, and even family members don\u2019t always understand. This is why so many people with bipolar disorder suffer in silence.\n\nI wish people knew that having **bipolar disorder symptoms** doesn\u2019t make us broken or less deserving of love, understanding, and opportunities. Yes, it\u2019s a lifelong condition, but with proper treatment\u2014whether that\u2019s therapy, medication, or lifestyle adjustments\u2014we can lead fulfilling lives.\n\nIf you\u2019re someone out there battling **bipolar disorder stigma** or just trying to survive another day, know that you\u2019re not alone.

Sometimes I wonder if people really understand how exhausting it is to live with **bipolar disorder** and the constant battle with mood swings. It\u2019s like being at war with myself\u2014one minute, I\u2019m high on life, feeling unstoppable, and the next, I\u2019m drowning in sadness, struggling to just exist.\n\nI know I\u2019m not alone in this, but it still feels like no one truly gets how hard it is to manage these daily fluctuations. The worst part? The unpredictability. I never know when the high will crash, or when the depressive wave will hit. And when it does, it feels like a tidal wave that pulls me under.\n\nOne quote that really resonates with me is by **Stephen Fry**, who once said, \u201cI am not afraid of being depressed. I am afraid of being happy, because I know that one day the happiness will be gone.\u201d It feels like I\u2019m always bracing for the other shoe to drop.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the guilt. Every time I\u2019m up, I feel like I\u2019m too much, like I\u2019m pushing people away with my energy and enthusiasm. When I\u2019m down, I feel like I\u2019m too little, like I\u2019m not giving enough to those around me. It\u2019s like I\u2019m never just \u201cenough\u201d in my own skin.\n\nSometimes, the emotional swings feel like they\u2019re out of my control, but I try to remind myself of a powerful quote from **Maya Angelou**: \u201cWe may encounter many defeats, but we must not be defeated.\u201d I have to keep reminding myself that these mood swings don\u2019t define me.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting, but I know I\u2019m not alone in this battle. To anyone else struggling with **bipolar mood swings**, I want to remind you that you are so much more than your condition. We\u2019re all in this together.\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with similar feelings, I\u2019d love to hear your experiences and how you cope with the daily ups and downs. How do you find balance? How do you keep going when everything feels unpredictable?\n\nThanks for letting me vent. I\u2019m hoping for a better day tomorrow.",

        "text": "I Want More Than Stability in My Bipolar Disorder  I\u2019m quiet. Because I don\u2019t have a lot to say.\n\nWhen I\u2019m well, I have \u201coomph\u201d for talking, whereas when I\u2019m unwell, the thought of ordering coffee is completely overwhelming.\n\nThe opposite is true with writing. When I am unwell, words drip from my fingertips, but when life trots along nicely, I dry up.\n\nSo here I am, all dried up.\n\nAnd that\u2019s good news. Right? I\u2019m so well I have nothing to say.\n\nMy mood has become extremely stable in recent months, which is apparently an aim of recovery in\u00a0[**bipolar II disorder**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HG2GKM6). No big highs. No big lows.\n\nBut the other thing that happens without highs and lows is mood becomes very flat. And that, I do not like.\n\nMood fluctuation is a normal part of the human experience and isn\u2019t necessarily reactive to circumstance. How wondrously cheerful would you feel if the boss wandered in to say you\u2019re getting a raise. Sadness descends if your beloved dog passes away. These are situational emotions, and for healthy functioning people, just part of life\u2019s journey.\n\nThen there are mood fluctuations outside of situations. One morning you wake feeling well, rested, energized, positive, and ready to face the day ahead. Another day, the clouds are grey. You feel fatigued and drab and with no real desire to even feed the cat.\n\nSo, [**when I say my mood is stable**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09GZKQWFP), that\u2019s what it looks like. A few highs and lows, but on a gentle fluctuating wave.\n\nBut my wave is almost flat.\n\nDue to mood stabilizers \u2014 surely nothing short of a modern medical miracle \u2014 I struggle to feel \u201cup.\u201d There\u2019s no get up and go. I rarely feel energized or excited. I just function. Getting out of bed and feeding the cat is all doable. I occasionally dust off the vacuum cleaner. If a friend wants to go for a walk, I can walk. When I\u2019m finalizing details for my book launch, I feel cheerful. There is movement at the mood station, but it\u2019s not a lot.\n\nI expend the energy I have trying to look \u201cnormal.\u201d I can do it \u2014 don\u2019t get me wrong. This stabilization business sees me getting out there and conversing with people. I get a few things done. Occasionally wander off for a walk. But I miss the highs. I really miss them.\n\n**Bipolar** is a spectrum of moods from major **depression** through to **mania**. **Bipolar II** doesn\u2019t go all the way to full mania\u00a0\u2014 we have instead, what is called **hypomania**.\n\n**These are periods of overactive and excited behavior** that can have a significant impact on your day-to-day life. Hypomania is a milder version of mania that lasts for a short period (usually a few days).\n\nI gotta say, hypomania feels good. And that\u2019s when I can really crank up the vacuuming.\n\nTo the outside observer, I might seem completely driven and focused, talking too fast, walking too fast, obsessing over details, completely sleepless, and coordinating a plethora of tasks simultaneously. But on the inside, I could climb a mountain. And I\u2019m sure a few of the mountains I\u2019ve climbed were inspired by hypomania.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound too bad, right? But it\u2019s part of a swinging pendulum, and when I\u2019m not well, all that machine gun energy will crash and burn to major depression.\n\n**This is what happened to me**.\n\nAnd it is this dangerously low major depression\u00a0the mental health professionals are trying to steer me away from. I gotta say, I don\u2019t want to go back there either. The mood wave with phenomenal peaks and troughs.\n\nI have been on two mood stabilizing medications for 18 months. They appear to be doing a good job and aside from feeling flat all the time, there are no side effects. Everyone else seems pretty happy with this state of affairs. I\u2019m not.\n\nNow that I\u2019m stable, I\u2019m wanting more. It is not enough for me to just think about all the things I want to get done, I want the energy to do more than the basics. I want the energy to be self-motivated. And so, I have made a decision. I\u2019m going to start reducing my medication. Just a little bit. And only under medical supervision. If the wave gets wobbly, I can always go back, but if I don\u2019t at least try a lower dose, I won\u2019t know what happens.\n\n**Prior to the overdose**, I had \u2014 for a long time \u2014 skipped my antidepressant medication on a regular basis. I never felt comfortable on it and the first thing the doctors did in hospital was take me off it. Antidepressants are apparently a bad idea for bipolar patients. I haven\u2019t skipped a single, solid dose of my current meds. Not one. I\u2019ve been a very good girl and the results are paying off. But my psychiatrist agrees the ultimate aim for anyone is to be on the lowest working dose, so I\u2019m about to begin the great dose-modification experiment.\n\nTime will tell how it pans out.\n\nMy secret hope is I become infused with enough energy to feel inspired and excited, but remain stable enough to sleep at night and stay focused. The most likely outcome is I won\u2019t notice a difference. At which point I will corner my psychiatrist and beg to go down another dose. If things go a little pear-shaped, I can always go back up.\n\nStability is a lovely thing to have. My life just sort of meanders along. But it also feels pointless. It is hard to find purpose in a life that does nothing more meaningful than stack the dishwasher and write the occasional blog post. I miss feeling like a fully functioning adult.\n\nSo, I guess long story short, if I start writing blog posts on a daily basis, you\u2019ll know I\u2019m starting to flirt with both ends of the mood spectrum.

        "text": "What It's Like to Have the Other Type of Bipolar Disorder I have bipolar II disorder.\u00a0This is my story.\n\nFirst, some background. Bipolar disorder used to be called manic-depressive illness, and many people still know and refer to it that way. The term \u201cbipolar\u201d reflects the concept that there are two extremes to the continuum of mood disorders, and some people swing dramatically from one to the other. According to this definition, clinical depression by itself is \u201cunipolar,\u201d occupying only one end of the spectrum.\n\nDepression is to\u00a0sadness as a broken leg is to a splinter. Depression sucks the life from a person, mutes all emotions except misery, denies any possibility of joy or even contentment and makes life seem meaningless or impossible. This is hell.\n\nMania is to ordinary happiness as diving off a cliff is to diving off a diving board. Mania brings exhilaration, ambition, confidence, abandon and invincibility, *with no brakes.* It is hell on wheels.\n\nOscillating between the two extremes, that\u2019s bipolar disorder, type 1. It is a serious illness. Left untreated, it can cause destruction of families, careers and more. It can lead to psychosis or suicide. The treatments for it are no picnic either. A severe case of bipolar disorder often requires hospitalization. If the symptoms can be controlled with medication, then the patients must have frequent blood tests to assure that the drug is present in the right quantity.\n\nWhen I was (incorrectly) diagnosed with unipolar depression, I used to wish that I were bipolar, on the theory that at least then I could accomplish something. Boy, was I wrong about that. Plans made in mania never come to fruition. They are started, rethought, abandoned, exchanged for something grander and ultimately fizzle out when the mania wears off.\n\nMy diagnosis actually made some sense at the time, as I never experienced anything like the manic highs. All I got were depressive lows. This leads us at last to bipolar II disorder. The mood swings are not as extreme, the lows less debilitating and the highs less overwhelming. The person with bipolar II stays closer to a baseline of normal mood, but still experiences swings back and forth.\n\nTechnically, the mini-lows are called dysthymia and the mini-highs are called hypomania. In my case, the lows were just as low as in unipolar depression, but I never got the mini-jags of buoyancy that accompany hypomania. Instead, these feelings, came out sideways, as anxiety. My brain was still racing with little control, but in a different direction. Instead of elation and purpose, I was beset by in worries, fears and catastrophizing.\n\nOne of the difficulties with treating bipolar disorder (of either type) is trying to find a medication or a combination of medications that will level out the person\u2019s moods. Usually this requires more than one drug, and finding the right mix or cocktail of chemicals usually requires more than one drug. It takes a great deal of trial and error. In the meantime, the mood swings continue.\n\nAt this point, my bipolar II is fairly well-controlled on medication. I still have spells of depression. Now, they last at most a week and sometimes just a day or two. Untreated, they could last months or years. I still have anxiety too. However, I have the medication I take for that so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m about to jump out of my own skin.\n\nMost of the time, I\u2019m fairly high-functioning. I can write, work and earn a living. I have a great marriage and a number of friends, including some who are closer than family to me. I have never been hospitalized, nor have I had electroshock (though that was a near thing). Before I got my proper diagnosis and treatment, I would have not believed this to be possible. My goal in life was simply to stay out of a psychiatric hospital as long as I could or at least until I qualified for Social Security Disability.\n\nI\u2019m sharing these experiences with you today because I believe mental disorders should not be hidden or viewed with shame and horror as they have been in the past and sometimes the present.\n\nIt\u2019s undeniable that **there is a stigma associated with having mental illness**. Going public with it entails a risk. I\u2019ve seen the fixed \u201csmile and back away slowly\u201d reaction. I\u2019ve seen sudden turnarounds in my work performance evaluations, but I\u2019ve also seen the, \u201cMe too!\u201d response.\n\nThere is strength in numbers. As more of us who live with psychiatric conditions talk about it and share our stories, the more we build understanding. Perhaps, we also encourage those who are \u201croller-coastering\u201d to seek treatment.\n\nSo that\u2019s the nuts and bolts of it: Bipolar II disorder is a mental illness. I have it and live with it every day. I do not go around threatening the safety of other people or my own. I take medication for it. I know I will likely have to for the rest of my life, and I\u2019m OK with that. I hope that eventually the rest of the world will be, too.",

Although **bipolar disorder** is one of the most common mental illnesses, it\u2019s also one of the **most misunderstood**. To shed light on bipolar disorder, we asked members of our bipolar disorder community what they want others to know about their lives with the menta health condition. Here\u2019s what they had to say.\n\n**1. People with** **bipolar disorder** **can feel emotions deeply.**\n\n\u201cI feel everything a lot more than people may think.\u201d\n\n**2.** **Mania** **isn\u2019t enjoyable.**\n\n\u201cI do not enjoy **mania** \u2026 I hate the **hypersexuality**, the agitation, and the obsession.\u201d\n\n**3.** **Bipolar disorder** **isn\u2019t a choice.**\n\n\u201cBipolar disorder is not a choice.\u00a0You can\u2019t \u2018get over it;\u2019 you have to fight with every ounce of strength you have.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chemical imbalance, not a choice.\u201d\n\n**4.** **Bipolar disorder** **can be painful.**\n\n\u201cBipolar disorder is more painful than anyone could imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough bipolar disorder can bring me a zest for life at times, it can also bring excruciating pain.\u201d\n\n**5. Living with** **bipolar disorder** **can take a lot of energy.**\n\n\u201cI wish people understood the literal mental combat I go through just to stay present.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish people knew just how much effort it takes just to manage my symptoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m using every ounce of energy I can find to keep myself healthy.\u201d\n\n**6. People often make assumptions about** **bipolar disorder.**\n\n\u201cThe **bipolar disorder** **stereotype** people may think of is someone being extremely angry one moment and then being super nice later.\u00a0People assume that if you don\u2019t act like that, then you must be fine, even if you aren\u2019t.\u201d  \n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5yuts3rryx381.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=aabeded893bdc88a610927696e2aaf3f11078c4b\n\n**7.** **Bipolar disorder** **can cause rapid mood changes.**\n\n\u201cI wish others understood that my mood, feelings, and emotional expression can change very quickly with no apparent reason.\u201d\n\n**8.** **Bipolar disorder** **can make starting the day difficult.**\n\n\u201cThere are days I can barely get out of bed.\u201d\n\n**9. People with** **bipolar disorder** **aren\u2019t dangerous.**\n\n\u201cIn my case, the only person I\u2019m dangerous to is myself. I\u2019m not the monster under your bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish people knew I\u2019m not a monster just because I have bipolar disorder.\u201d\n\n**10. People with** **bipolar disorder** **are human.**\n\n\u201cI am human.\u00a0I can have a bad day at work and feel unhappy about it for reasons that have nothing to do with bipolar disorder.\u201d\n\n**11. Medication can help keep people with** **bipolar disorder** **stable.**\n\n\u201cI have **bipolar I**, and I must have medication to keep me as emotionally stable as possible. If I don\u2019t, I spiral out of control in both manic and depressive states.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I forget to take my medication, everything, even the smallest things, can be a struggle.\u201d\n\n**12. Recovery from** **bipolar disorder** **is possible.**\n\n\u201cRecovery is possible.

        "wellbeing_insight": "Okay, let's analyze bipolar disorder based on the provided text and offer Ryff-based wellbeing insights.\n\n**Analysis of Bipolar Disorder (Based on Text):**\n\nThe text emphasizes that bipolar disorder is a *misunderstood* mental illness characterized by intense emotions, mood swings (including mania, which isn't always enjoyable), and periods of depression. It's a *chemical imbalance*, not a choice, requiring significant energy to manage. People with bipolar disorder face stereotypes and assumptions, and the condition can significantly impact their daily lives, including difficulty starting the day. Crucially, the text debunks the myth that individuals with bipolar disorder are inherently dangerous, emphasizing their humanity and the possibility of recovery through medication and management.\n\n**Ryff's Wellbeing Insights for Bipolar Disorder (Practical Advice):**\n\n*   **Autonomy:** Practice asserting your needs, set boundaries with others, and make independent decisions when possible, even in small ways.\n*   **Environmental Mastery:** Create a structured routine. Identify triggers and develop coping mechanisms. Seek support groups for shared experiences.\n*   **Personal Growth:** Set small, achievable goals. Learn new skills, embrace changes as learning opportunities.\n*   **Positive Relations:** Nurture supportive relationships. Communicate your needs clearly. Forgive others and yourself.\n*   **Purpose in Life:** Identify meaningful activities. Volunteer, pursue hobbies, or contribute to something larger than yourself.\n*   **Self-Acceptance:** Practice self-compassion. Acknowledge your strengths and accept your limitations. Celebrate small victories in managing your condition."

        "text": "I got an unbelievable internship, and my summer plans just keep getting better. I have always wanted to see the world and go as many places as possible. I'm going to start with a few small trips early this year and do bigger trips over summer.\n\nInitially, I organized the summer trip to keep myself busy, as I will not have a job this summer due to limitations on my contract. I decided there's nothing better to do in my free time than visit some places abroad, so I started making arrangements to become a globetrotter and do some work along the way.\n\nIt started out with a commitment to one month in Europe, where I will be staying with a team of people while we all work on a project. It's a very unique opportunity in a great environment, and it was also an excellent reason to go abroad. I managed to get accommodations, food, etc., covered for insanely cheap, which made it even better.\n\nBut that's only one month, and I have three to burn. Again, no job to keep me busy until August, so I decided to apply to a bunch of internships and positions. I didn't think anything much would come of it, but I figured no harm could be done.\n\nI sent out 46 emails and got about 20 responses. Most of them said there were no positions available, but a few said they could take on unofficial volunteers, and even fewer said they could take an actual intern. There were two positions in particular that I had emailed about, and they are highly prestigious, to the point that I didn't think I'd even get an email back. But lo and behold, they replied, and I couldn't believe it.\n\nOf those two, I ended up picking the position which I felt would be the most useful and interesting. It is at a world-renowned institution, in a position envied and admired by quite literally everyone in my field. I was blown away when they replied, but they genuinely welcomed me and said I could come work with them. I kept thinking the opportunity would disappear until this morning, when I had a virtual meeting with them, and I've now confirmed that this is actually happening.\n\nI'm now going to spend 2 months in Europe this summer, kickstarting a hopefully long career of literal and figurative exploration, fulfilling my dreams, meeting new people, and having a great time. It still doesn't feel quite real. I have a really hard time giving myself credit for what I've accomplished, and I am waiting for this to slip through my fingers and into the hands of someone more deserving. But this is happening, I earned it, and I'm so, so excited!",

I have not let myself read through most of my old journals; I avoid \"triggers\" that remind me of what I experienced, although that's nearly impossible given my circumstances; and I am on edge often.\n\nI can't do it by myself, and I'm going to bring it up with my therapist, but I think that it's about time to actually, fully, really process what happened, especially the parts I want to forget. I realized that I can't move on without knowing what I'm moving on from, and I can never relax without facing the past.

I was hypomanic for several weeks and then manic for about a month, a total of 14 weeks of raw chaos and then about a month and a half after that to actually get stable.\n\nI am now stable! I am still dealing with some lingering effects, and unfortunately the mania seems to have aggravated some existing conditions that I now have to deal with. BUT, I am happy to say that despite that period of my life, I have better friends than I've had in years. My career is going amazingly. I am about to get my degree in record time. I am so genuinely happy, and every day I wake up excited to see what comes next.\n\nI haven't experienced this level of contentedness in years. It can be tough dealing with these residual effects, but I'm almost completely unbothered because I am so genuinely happy. The nature of the beast is that this may not last forever, but the knowledge that we can live well gives me a lot of hope.\n\nI hope everyone here can experience this level of joy at some point.

Lets start with a major depressive episode, in discord miguel said \"im having a shit ton of fun but also i want to fucking die\" this state of depression is a clear sign of regular mood disruptions which would hint at bipolar disorder. Now that we've established that miguel has shown signs of major depressive episodes we can establish a hypomanic episode. One obvious instance of this is when I said that I was doing homework and miguel gets very irritated and says \" WTF EVEN IS DOING HOMEWORK\" and \"LMAO IMAGINE UNIRONICALLY BEING RESPONSIBLE\" this irritability is a sign of hypomanic episodes.

He\u2019s got a huge idea for a new project (only remotely art-related, more about the metaverse/crypto space), and has been lacking sleep, talking fast and erratically, crying tears of joy on and off, had lots of highs and lows. \n\nWe\u2019ve talked almost exclusively about his new idea for the past few days, and I don\u2019t share the same excitement he has because I don\u2019t fully understand his idea, and if I\u2019m being honest, some of the things he\u2019s been saying have sounded \u2018crazy\u2019 (I don\u2019t like using that word in this context, but to the average person, that\u2019s probably the word they\u2019d use).\n\nI\u2019ve somewhat considered leaving him because I\u2019ve seen a totally new side of him. It\u2019s like he\u2019s a completely different person, not the person I\u2019ve always known and loved. It\u2019s actually scaring me.\n\nHave any of you guys had episodes like this, or known someone? Was it short-lived? Is it just that he\u2019s sleep-deprived? What can I do to help him, give him space or give him support for what seems to me like a borderline crazy idea? Will he have these episodes more frequently as he gets older?\n\nI\u2019ve never personally known anyone with symptoms like this, and have no idea what to do. I\u2019d love to hear anyone\u2019s input, or just to know that we\u2019re not alone in this, or that there\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThanks in advance if you\u2019ve read this far",

Any tips on making art when it's just so so hard? **Warning** that I kind of devolve into self bashing here, so if that would bother you or get negative thoughts going please skip. Hope this kind of post is ok. \n\nI'm a long time professional sad with a handful of shitty illnesses on my list. Art is that one thing I feel even the slightest bit of actual enthusiasm for any more, I'm sure many of you relate. I'm not in as deep of a bad depressive episode atm and have gotten used to how bad my other illnesses affect me... but it's still so fucking hard!!\n\nI can sit down and open up my sketchbook and dabble, but *consistently* working on a piece that I want to finish and be proud of is something i haven't managed in years. I've tried to do a little daily, but I get discouraged or too tired and stop.\n I'm also recently off of a multi month slump. I feel like I'm further behind than ever and that i should give up in every way. I wanted to be a professional illustrator or concept artist, but I feel too old for it (im coming up on 25, my online acquaintances are getting professional dream jobs, im still me) and like I'll never make it now. There is nothing special or amazing about my art, so why would I be picked above another?\nSatisfaction is so rare for me now. I don't know what i want to make, or why. I'll start something and maybe even like it but stop because I'm not sure it's the right art to be making. It's infuriating. And really saddening. \nAlso i want whatever the people who can go to work and do art the same day are on. Or sometimes who can just do stuff in their houses and art same day. \nBut regardless, ugh. I just want to do better. I see the drive and energy and ability and passion it seems to take to make it as an artist.. and I'm worried I just don't have it. I rolled a bad hand and feel so stuck.

        "text": "I don't know how to approach drawing anymore. It hurts so bad and I don't see any glimmer of hope.   I'd like to both vent and ask for advice. Ever since I picked drawing up(about 3.5 years ago I guess) I have struggled without any success. I don't want to go in detail about the past before picking it up and other personal problems which have or still are affecting me. All I want you to know is that they were a problem. I want to keep this short-ish since I don't want to cry for longer than necessary.\n\n Anyways, the first 2 years were 90% an emotional war. I almost never drew and when I did, I almost always started crying. I almost entirely got rid of this by now though. I literally started at toddler level and me being so much worse than other beginners was painful. Even now, I'm at about a beginner level for an 18 years old. A few beginners I sometimes find online are even better than me now.\n\n For reasons like this, I never understood why people always say talent doesn't matter. Maybe I'm talking out of my ass but most people who say that had advantages from the start. Be it a better starting point, which helps since the eye is behind the hand or understanding different concepts quicker. Improving faster doesn't matter as much but it still is a thing. This can also be affected by how you practice though.\n\n On top of being absolute trash, I had difficulty understanding basic concepts and not the best improvement speed. I spent like 5 hours with someone, sometime in the first 2 years to understand how to draw from that 3/4 perspective. When I got to the basic perspective part in drawabox, I spent close to two weeks trying to understand it and even then I didn't grasp it fully. I didn't spend as much time thinking or drawing nor did it daily in that period but I think I still put like 10 hours into trying to figure it out. Some people were surprised I took so long which was a huge hit to my self esteem at the time. I first tried drawabox sometime last year. Got back to it near the end of 2018, took a break again and I got back to it again. I know that people didn't try to push me down with that and stuff like \"you realised that now?\" but it's still disheartening. I literally feel like I have no chance when art as a whole is my life.\n\n The following years after the Disaster Double were mainly fine. I could draw more and more consistently but it still wasn't enough and isn't enough. I took a ton of breaks too.\n\n My biggest issue is how I ran out of things to try. Everyone online only told me \"just force yourself to draw daily and don't wait for motivation. I tend to have start crying more often when I have motivation to draw stuff just because I like to draw really complex stuff. Waiting for motivation doesn't work, but neither making a habit of drawing daily. I tried doing that so many times, and for a while, it works, usually a couple weeks. In the end all my attempts crumbled beneath my feet and I was sent back to break territory. Nobody ever considers how others feel when giving personal advice. They always just say \"Everyone goes through that\". I'm unsure how many people struggled for so long and so often. Most people seem to be fine after they get drawing. This maybe just is me being angry at myself for my experience, but this is the general idea I got from people.\n\n It was even worse when I had a few people tell me \"maybe drawing isn't for you\". That really is the worst thing I ever heard. Why would I put myself through so much pain when I don't want to learn art for fame or money or whatever else? I want to learn it for me because I'm passionate. I even tried giving up a few times, but drawing never left my head ever since I picked it up and I can't give up on it. I gave up on a lot of things due to frustration, and really quickly. This is the only thing that stuck with me.\n\n Even though due to classmates making fun of my stuff in first grade which made me give up art entirely in fourth grade I still always created stuff. It maybe was just in my head through imagination, but it was my way of coping with that. \n\n I tried some other things too but nothing really worked. I can't recall them though. I could really appreciate all advice I could get. I hope that I got my point across. I can't concentrate well when I'm talking about art. Thanks for reading my vent! \n\n\nAlso, sorry for acting like a prick. I kind of am jealous of people who got luckier with art than I did. I tried to improve myself and become as nice of a person as I could, which I did but I still can't get over that. I'm a horrible person for thinking that way. It just hurts so much I act without thinking straight.",

For me, those two things almost always go hand-in-hand, torturing me together.\n\nIn that strange, bittersweet moment of clarity, I decided to take advantage of not having to constantly fight off the overwhelming desire to die. I wrote this poem\u2014a letter to myself\u2014for the next time I am suicidal, hoping it might inspire me or at least ease some of the pain when I\u2019m in that dark place again.\n\nThese are all the things I\u2019m forced to forget when severe depression takes over\u2014when suicidal urges consume my every thought. These are the truths I need to remember in my worst moments to help me get through them.\n\nI ended the poem by saying, \u201cI love you\u201d to myself, which, along with \u201cYou deserve to live,\u201d are the most important words in it. Do I love myself? No. Have I ever loved myself? Also no. But I want to love myself. I hope that by the next time I, unfortunately, find myself suicidal, I\u2019ll feel differently about myself. Maybe, just maybe, if I keep saying, \u201cI love you\u201d to myself, I\u2019ll eventually convince my brain it\u2019s true.\n\nI don\u2019t want these words to be limited to just me.
