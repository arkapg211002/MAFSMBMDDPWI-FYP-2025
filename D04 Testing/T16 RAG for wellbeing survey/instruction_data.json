Ive been diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder, OCD, agoraphobia, and somatization disorder. My anxiety is marked by recurring physical symptoms like dizziness, nearfainting, tachycardia, sweating, nausea, and brain fog. These symptoms cycle weekly and are accompanied by intrusive thoughts and hypervigilance that make daily life a challenge. Ive tried a wide range of treatments, including SSRIs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and other meds, but most either didnt help or worsened my symptoms. Benzodiazepines provide some relief for panic attacks but not for generalized anxiety or OCD. Ive also explored alternative medications like Clonidine and Lyrica without success. My symptoms are present 247 and i never get a break ever. When my condition flares up during the day it becomes so bad that i am not even aware im having anxiety, i just feel delusionally sick physically and mentally. Ive spent years undergoing medical tests MRIs, blood work, specialist visits to rule out physical causes, but no definitive answers have emerged. My psychiatrist suspects underlying bipolar traits, and Im being referred to a specialist for further evaluation. Im looking into nardil as a next step and am curious if anyone here has had success with it for anxiety. Also open to any advice, insights, or experiences with treatmentresistant anxiety.",

Then two years ago I had this horrifying anxiety attack that lasted 11 days, and it completely changed my life for the worse. But Ive never had normal anxiety. I mean as in the daily anxiety feeling that lingers. Ive only ever had it as an extreme anxiety or panic attack, and then when its over, the anxiety slowly calms down over the course of about a month. But two months ago I started having normal anxiety. I it started as a day long anxiety attack, and then it calmed down. Or so I thought, cause 2 months later Im still anxious and Im so confused and scared. Ive had my blood work done to check if theres anything wrong. I had low b12 levels, and also folate deficiency which can cause anxiety, but after a few weeks of supplementing the anxiety is still here and its scaring me to think that this may never pass. Im not used to this. I had a panic attack a few days ago, the first since I was a teenager, and Im so so so so fucking scared. I categorize anxiety attacks and panic attacks as two different things. Anxiety attacks feels like panic attacks, but lasts multiple days. Panic attacks lasts a couple of hours Ive always said that Id sacrifice every limb of my body if it meant Id never experience anxiety again. Id rather be chronically physically ill forever than live with anxiety. And now Im anxious every day. Im so scared that Ive developed generalized anxiety disorder. I cant live like this. My psychologist says I have to accept the anxiety for it to get better, but Im not capable of sitting in it. Its the worst feeling Ive ever had. Nothing is giving me the anxiety.

        "input": "Urgent Help About two months ago my stepmom started developing an extreme phobia of bad weather fear of winds, storms, and tornadoes, specifically. My dad is at his wits end and has no idea how to help her anymore. Just to offer some background on the complexities of the situation, my dad is 60 years old and works full time, she is 35 and stays at home with the kids 10 month old baby, 3 year old toddler, and her son who is 15 years old. None of them speak English very well. My stepmom, stepbrother, and 3 year old baby brother all moved to America a little over a year ago. My dad owns a trailer that hes lived in for the past 11 years in the suburbs of Chicago. My stepmom knew this before we began the paperwork process to bring them over here. Everything was normal and peaceful the entire time theyve been here until one day in February or March when the power went out in the trailer because of a storm. It came back on the next day, but my stepmom says thats when the fear started. Flash forward to September when I moved out, she started experiencing panic attacks, crying, losing her appetite whenever there is even just wind sounds outside. She checks the weather everyday and at has even left the trailer with the kids in the middle of the day a couple of times. She doesnt know how to drive and doesnt speak english. On one occasion, she asked the neighbor if she could pay him to drop them off at Walmart and she stayed there with all the kids for the entire day until my dad got out of work and picked them up. Now she asks my dad to book a hotel room for a day so that she can stay there with the kids because theres a forecast of bad weather tomorrow. My stepbrother has missed a lot of school because hes staying at home with her. I found her a Spanishspeaking psychiatrist who shes met with twice now via telemedicine in the past three weeks. The psychiatrist prescribed her trazadone, setraline, and most recently hydroxyzine. I sent her over a list of therapist who she can set up an appointment with to start counseling but I dont think shes called anyone. Her symptoms dont seem to be getting better and my dad doesnt know what else to do. All she says is that shes scared to live in the trailer. Hes now selling the trailer and plans to move into a more expensive apartment for nearby so that she can be calm and so that their lives go back to normal, but theyre waiting on the apartment application to be processed. In the meantime, things dont seem to be getting better and this problem has turned their entire lives upside down. My stepmom says that when shes in a solid building she feels much better and doesnt experience any panic attacks, but that in the trailer her heart races and she feels like she cant breathe and shes just really afraid. My dad cant afford to keep booking them hotel rooms and he is threatening that if these problems dont stop after they move into the apartment then theres nothing more he can do. At night she cries a lot and that prevents him from being able to sleep and he has to get up for work at 4 am each day. He took a whole week off work last week to try to tackle this problem, I also went over there for a few days to help since I speak spanish. Thats when we found the apartment and filled out all the paperwork and stuff. Originally the plan was to take her to the ER, but the psychiatrist advised against that unless she is in the middle of a panic attack. Can anyone please help me help them. What kind of resources are available for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder? These are the diagnoses she was given by the psychiatristThey have no else who can help them nearby. The only other solution would be to send my stepmom and the kids back to Cuba where she would be able to live with her mom. But my dad would essentially be losing his family. He wanted a better life for my younger siblings. My stepmom also doesnt want to return but my dad cant handle the situation on his own anymore. Im sorry this is really long but I just need help. My dads birthday is coming up and this is tearing him up. He says his life is in limbo right now and he doesnt know what else to do.",

A good part of her GAD focuses on her health, and on being left out or cheated on in a relationship. Once she gets a thought hyperfocused, we cant turn the panic attack and anxiety off. For hours or days. She will logically know the fear isnt real. She will have talked herself down rationally. She gas the ability to continue on with her day as far as taking care of chores and errands. But the entire time, she is raging mad inside, horribly scared and has to constantly fight the urge to let a full blown panic attack happen. Its exhausting for her and there hasnt been any improvement, despite what we have tried. She can sleep a full 8 hours, and wake up STILL in that mood. She wont even be mentally bothered but her mind and body will not stop reacting. Im not annoyed, frustrated or tired. Im not at my wits end, Im not even doing this in desperation. She has simply figured out that this facet of the disorder is her biggest struggle, and she has come to me asking for help and advice as someone who deals with a lot. In short, Im here asking others with the disorder, who deal with similar frustrations to let me know what has worked for you.

Ive been battling anxiety for 3 years now since college, and while Ive made progress, Im not so sure I have. I was put on medicine and took myself off wasnt smart, but as soon as I started my first job, it came back. I tried to wean myself off again, and it wasnt working. I started seeing a psychiatrist this past September. Hes been great and for several months I felt great. It wasnt until after I sat for a CPA Exam that i started to feel anxiety again for a few weeks. Perhaps I was awaiting the score, but all went well. A week later, the pandemic and quarantine started around St Pattys Day. Pretty much since then, Ive been on and off. One good week, one off week. Two good weeks, one off week. And I dont even know if off is the right word. It doesnt last the whole week or even a whole day, but its this constant monitoring to see if Im anxious and how I feel. My anxiety has become this general feeling of uneasiness and worry with constant rumination. When I feel good, things are rolling along and I cant understand how I get caught in my web of anxiety. However, on the flip side, once Im caught, it feels as though Ill never get out even though I always do and I know there is no danger. So I dont even know if Im technically experiencing anxiety at this point, or Im psyching myself out due to fear and the past. Isnt it bad that in the fall I went months feeling good and now Im on and off all of a sudden? My doctor is contemplating putting me on 40mg, but wants to see what happens after lockdown. He says everyone is struggling right now, which I get. Im extremely analytical and my worse fear is this lasting forever. I even see posts I made a year ago asking questions regarding anxiety, so it seems Im in the same spot. My anxiety used to be panic attacks but now it is the symptoms I described. I exercise, Ive read books on it, but it always comes back. I dont wanna go on more medicine because I want to get off it one day. If its necessary I guess I dont have a choice. How can I keep getting caught in the same trap every other damn week? Is there something wrong with me? Sorry for the long post, but can anyone give an opinionadvicehelp?

When I finally moved, I perched onto of a chair and curled up around my water bottle. Or Ill refuse to go into buildings my body deems unsafe.

I rarely talk fo her about anxiety, and if we do its not really a problem.

I quit my job and made my boyfriend go into stores for me and getting takeout. He came and sat in the parking lot while I was in classes.

She constantly puts herself down and says shes not good at things that from an outside perspective other people, not me because I know she actually feels like this seems like shes just looking for validation because its obvious to everyone but her that she is actually good at it, e.g. she is currently ranked second in our class but constantly says she is no good at academic stuff. She has broken down in tears multiple times this year over the stress she feels and her feelings of being overwhelmed, and I honestly cannot deal with it any more. It feels like our whole relationship has become about her feelings of worry but she wont do anything about it. Ive asked her multiple times if she would consider going to talk to a counsellor she never has and she has never been formally diagnosed with anxiety, and I know I probably shouldnt do this but I do think she suffers from it Ive told her Im worried about her, Ive told her that at one point I considered calling her mom to help me get through to her because I was so worried. It feels like Im talking to a literal brick wall and that nothing is going through. It makes me feel useless, and Im getting to the stage where Ive stopped telling her constantly that she is good at stuff, etc. because shes just not listening.

My main concern is that I am paranoid of being paranoid and it scares me so much.

But at the time it happens it feels so real like I feel fear inside of me and am terrified. I am extremely scared of going insane and losing touch with reality.

        "input": "Ridiculous insecurity postpartumneed help and advice Hi friends I gave birth to twins my first kids 8 months ago and it has been extremely difficult, and that is an understatement. I have anxiety at baseline, but postpartum has amplified that 100fold. They were conceived naturally, and it was an absolute shock when we found out at my first ultrasound. I have been struggling badly through PPD, PPA, and extremely crippling insecurity, and Im not sure how to navigate this I do have a therapist, she is somewhat helpful. Mainly, I am going through insane insecurity, specifically around my husband. The thought of him with other women makes me want to crawl out of my skin. I always had a level of being territorial in the past, but it was not excessive, more of like a this is my man but now, it gives me immense distress to picture him with anyone else. He is a good man and has not given me a reason to suspect that hes doing anything behind my back. The main thing that happened was that he went to a strip club on a bachelor party when I was pregnant it was planned before I got pregnant, I was very newly pregnant when he went, and I told him he could go to the party since it had already been planned. In the past I was never bothered by strip clubs I realize everyone has very different views on this and I respect them all but after he came back and told me about it, I lost my shit and in postpartum it has become so much worse, like intrusive images of him with the stripper who he got lap dances from, picturing him in a very intimate situation with her, etc. Im sure this event has augmented the insecurity and my hormones are not helping at all. He was very apologetic and has expressed a lot of remorse, not thinking it would affect me the way it did I also did not think it would mess with me like it did. Really just looking for advice on how I can stifle this insecurity because it has gotten very bad. I havent been able to lose the last 20 lbs I want to lose to get back to my prepregnancy body, and my c section scar just bothers the shit out of me whenever I see it. I just feel so broken now, I used to be so much more confident, excited for life, loved going out with friends and dressing up and I always kinda knew I was out of my husbands league he has told me that before, and now I feel like a shell of my former self and sometimes with all the overwhelm of my life, I feel like its not really worth living anymore.",

However Im looking for insight from others as the internet only says Zoloft is likely to cause OVERproduction. I had been on Sertraline 100mg prior to my pregnancy for anxiety and felt the need to start it up again after having baby. November 14 I started the same dosage again, per the prescriptionapproval of my OB. Prior to this, I was producing 2.53oz per pump. By November 17th my supply was noticeably dropping and since then I am only producing .51.5 oz per pump at the very most. I have run the gamut with my lactation consultant trying to diagnose possible causes.. Stress, pumping frequency, pump malfunction, flange size, diet, etc etc. She finally had me get blood work to test my iron and prolactin this week and my prolactin was only 21 ngmL when it should be upwards of 100. The only correlation we can draw is starting the Sertraline. Of course stopping the Sertraline is not an option for me at this time as my mental health is priority. But she talked with me about the use of Domperidone as a possible solution to get my prolactin up? Does anyone have any experience with using the Domperidone for this andor any experience with a drop in supply when starting an SSRI andor any remedies for this to get my supply back up? She also mentioned I could try supplementing moringa to help the prolactin but its unlikely to make an impact to override the Sertraline.

And now I have bad ppd and ppa. Anytime I start telling my story to them they hardly listen and they change the topic. They are topically positive, in my opinion. Sometimes negative things meed to be discussed. I feel like they really dont care mich about what I went through and they just want to hog my baby. They are from another state across the country so I get they want to soak up baby time. But when she cries instead of bringing her to me they try to fix her up themselves and tell me shes fine . She isnt fine. Thats her hunger cry...or her diaper cry...or her tired cry. So when I tell them gently, she needs a new diaper they dont belive me and continue singing to her and walking her up and down the halls. I corrected them when they fell asleep with her on the couch and when they tried holding her up high on a bar chair and I said please dont do that it could end badly and it gives me anxiety. They say shes fine. Im like no please listen. Finally I cried to my hubby and he finally listened. I was seperate from my baby for a few days in the hospital while I was dying and then for weeks after I needed a lot of help with caring for her. So now that I can be the mom I want my baby to know Im the mom and I dont want others trying to replace me. For instance when she fussed they wanted me to get them a bottle so they could feed her...but I said no Im trying to only nurse her and use bottles for if I have to leave for an appointment or if I need a nap. For the most part she never gets bottles. They acted like thats rediculous. But its really hard to breast deed and latch her right now. Shes 3 months and has regressed back to nipple shields which are a pain in the ass. I just want one thing to be natural and promote bonding so Im really serious about breast feeding her. Its going well till others try to tell me what to do. I was putting her in her carseat and FIL would not stop trying to help buckle after I said repeatedly that I got it. Like when Im caring for my baby as the mom, keep away and let me be. I dont need advice or help if Im not asking for it. I am very maternal and have been a nurse for over 8 years with lots of peds and neo experience, plus I grew up baby sitting human babies and had a farm full of baby animals that I took care of and bottle fed PLUS I read a bunch of baby books throughout pregnancy.

Now, my colostrum is drying up despite me trying every way to stimulate my nipples, pump, and latch my baby on and my milk hasnt come in. I cant even hand express more than a dribble.

While this should be a time of celebration, this past year has been incredibly overwhelming and painful. I lost my mom a year ago in December, and my small support system became nearly nonexistent. After my Csection, I was hospitalized twice for postpartum hypertension that came out of nowhere. It was terrifying, but I thought Id get a break afterward and finally focus on enjoying my time with my son. Instead, my son caught Covid, and we spent Christmas in the hospitalon the same ward where I had been treated for postpartum hypertension. That period was traumatizing, especially as it coincided with the first anniversary of my moms passing. When my son was five months old, I went to the ER for palpitations likely a panic attack and a spot was found on my lung. The waiting and testing that followed pushed my nervous system into overdrive. I was convinced I had cancerevery new sensation in my body felt like confirmation of it. I was at the ER so often, terrified I had something like a brain tumor or metastasis. Thankfully, the spot turned out to be benign, but it was rare and required surgery in late June to remove part of my lung. Now I have to go for regular followups, and the scan anxiety has been debilitating. My moms experience with metastatic breast cancer only fuels my fears. In July, I started experiencing palpitations again and was referred to a cardiologist. I was convinced I had pulmonary hypertension and fell into another dark spiral. Thankfully, all tests, including an echocardiogram and Holter monitor, came back normal anxiety. Now Im dealing with acid reflux that has triggered another wave of health anxiety. Every new symptom sends me into a spiral of worstcase scenarios. Im terrified I wont feel well enough to enjoy my sons first birthday, and I desperately need this December to be free of more painful memories. Its hard to share these feelings with other moms because I often hear I cant imagine, which makes me feel even more isolated. Ive been in therapy, focusing on trauma, but I still feel like I dont know who I am anymore. The health anxiety is consuming, and Im exhausted from crying so much. My life has been so difficult and filled with so much trauma. All I want is to be able to experience my son, to be present for him, and to give him all the love and attention he deserves. On top of this, my relationship with my husband has been strained. Its been painful to realize that some people can only show up during the good times and struggle when things are hard. Im just praying that 2025 is a year of healing, joy, and peace because I feel so overwhelmed and scared right now. I dont want to die and leave my son.",

In fact we got engaged fairly quickly and shortly after our engagement I had a car accident leaving me unable to walk for almost 5 months. We also discovered we were pregnant. He was amazing the entire time and took care of me in ways that nobody should even have too until were old and sick. I will forever be grateful for him for that. Well our baby came in June. Everything has been great and we love him so much and our relationship has never been better honestly. Our sex life is phenomenal, our late night pillow talk is back to how it was when we were dating, we have date nights together and we text more because Im home with the baby and hes at work. I am and have been suffering for quite some time with PPA. It been a little better baby wise, was hoooorrrible for the first month or two, and has now switched to other things including self image issues and my need to try to look better. Im at my highest weight ever and as a girl who used to be able to go get her hair, nails and lashes done whenever Im now a mom with very minimal time for myself. Its been really hard. Ive also been trying to loose weight bc it will make me feel better over all to be healthier, especially with what trouble Im having with the repercussions of my injuries, that loosing the weight will make and help me get around better as a mom. Before pregnancy 185, before birth 260lbs, now 240lbs and still going So lately Ive been feeling insecure in my relationship even though everything seems good with us. A lot has happened to us in our timeframe but I know we do love each other a lot. When I think about him prior to this all of a sudden insecurities he makes me feel safe, loved, heard and cared for. We truly believe were soulmates and I wouldnt want to do life without him. But.. The other day we took the baby to his work for a holiday thanksgiving party. He introduced me and the baby and slipped up and called me Beth. Well my middle name is Beth, but his ex girlfriend who cheated on him with his bf while they were cling togethers name is also Beth. He corrected himself super fast and seemed extremely embarrassed and I didnt even say anything to him about it because we were at his job and I didnt want to argue about something like that when we never argue. We always talk things out. But for some reason my PPA wouldnt even let me bring it up. It was like if I shattered our perfect relationship with an argument about it or mentioned it I was gonna loose my mind. Another thing, hes been weird about my bestfriend. She currently going through a break up with her baby daddy. We both love her son like our own as he spends a lot of time with us. He keeps jokingly saying after we spend the day with them that hes been thinking and that he and his mother my bff should move in with us. He says it jokingly as if he just wants them to do that bc he loves her kid but the amount of times he brings it up is starting to bother me. He also said something recently like its fine ik you guys love each other yall can get married to each other and Ill just marry you. Like no I dont want to live and be with just you and not another woman thanks! Even tho I know hes kidding it rubs me the wrong way?? Idk outside of all of this like I said has been great. We want another baby, he doesnt even want to wait lol, and we want to get on with our plans to get married. He really is my bestfriend. Our families are planing to spend the holidays together and Im just upset w myself for not just speaking up and letting myself fester in this way. Idk why its happening and its very unlike me. I think Id I brought both of these things up hed be kinda shocked? Idk I just need advice and someone to talk this through w who is unbiased. Maybe someone who understands or has also had PPA or anxiety. We were both in really long relationships before eachother. Not ones that were good either. His ex cheated like I said and mine might have as he ended up with one of my ex bestfriends as well, so I think that that might have to do something with how Im feeling as well. My ex and my ex bff getting together was a shock early into my pregnancy and I know I prob shouldnt have cared but I was just taken aback that they could do that after being friends 10 years and my bf 8 years for so long I think that I really felt blindsided and thought I knew my ex better than that and its seeping into this relationship. Like am I really just that bad at knowing peoples trie intentions when two very prominent relationships of mine ended and then they ended up together. Idk I feel sick lol. Someone help I feel crazy",

All I ever wanted was to be a mom so I feel completely blindsided and let down by how low, anxious and overwhelmed Ive been feeling. Im from the US but moved to the UK six years ago. Since the pandemic my mental health has slowly been declining. I havent been able to put down roots in the way I wanted I still dont feel like I have any of my own people here. And being so far from my own family and friends has only added to the isolation that all new parents feel to some degree. We also had a loss before I got pregnant with my daughter. Im disgusted with myself that gratitude isnt enough to make me feel like Im a good mom. I feel like my daughter deserves so much better than me. Shes missed out on so many things because Ive been too anxious to leave the house and disrupt her routine. Sometimes when she naps or is asleep at night Im wired and cant rest because Im constantly anticipating her to wake up. I dont understand how Im feeling worse instead of better. Im finally getting therapy and am also exploring the possibility that I have PMDDmy cycles are so irregular but I feel the most extreme anxiety when my period is about to come. I just straight up dont enjoy being a mom sometimes and it makes me feel so shitty and awful. My husband gets so frustrated with me and doesnt understand my anxiety. He thinks Im just not trying hard enough but its all in my body I physically feel like Im about to die over the smallest things. My therapist believes that I likely have GAD and depression thats been exacerbated by giving birth. It makes so much sense and Im looking forward to hopefully getting to the bottom of whats going on and learn how to manage it. I dont want anyone else to be in this position but if your anxiety is worsening instead of improving, youre not alone, and please get the help you and your babybabies deserve",

I hate to ramble but of course my main concern is every time I have had a doctors appointment for my Daughter I get myself and all three kids ready I take the longest of course to shower and every time I do shower my Mother hits me with the remark of words why do you take so long or you took forever in there. Im at a loss of words cause I just had a baby its hard for me to still move some parts of my body.

        "input": "I hate my MIL and I cant help it Im a F23 SAHM and just had my son 4 months ago. Ive always been an independent person, I hate being helped or pitied. My family was very antisocial growing up, I saw my moms parents a few times a week but that was pretty much it, we didnt see my dads family except maybe 3 times a year. Nobody came over to our house and I wasnt allowed to spend the night anywhere. I hate when people tell me things I already knew. I have pretty bad preexisting anxiety, but I somehow function somewhat normally. Ive been like this my entire life. My MIL was definitely expecting to be a larger part of my sons life. My husband 27 says they were always at somebodys house every weekend, he lived with his grandparents for like a month just because. Both his mom and his dads sides would get together at their house for bbqs and what not, it would have been like 25 people, probably more. He spent the night at all kinds of different peoples houses. Both sets of grandparents watched him and his siblings frequently. MIL is also definitely going through some shit, her and my FIL divorced several years ago. Shes a boy mom to 5 boys. Idk if her new husband doesnt give her attention or what but shes always going on about missing her boys being little and nobody needs her anymore and shes always trying to get them together and she gets all bent out of shape if you cant. She says its fine, but you can tell it really makes her sad. My husband and I have already decided we arent leaving our son anywhere for a while, and were probably not ever doing sleepovers. She doesnt know that yet, thatll be a whole other ordeal. My son has severe reflux that Ive been trying to get under control for 4 months, and if youve had a baby with reflux you know its awful and so stressful. Other than that hes the perfect baby, super sweet and happy when hes not in pain. So I dont really feel like visiting my needy MIL. I dont have the energy to deal with her anymore, I cant even fake liking her anymore. I cant look at pictures of her when she pops up on facebook. She was texting relentlessly, sending tik toks of grandmas playing with their babies and saying maybe someday Ill get to be like this with Noah, texting that were holding him hostage. And now shes posting pictures of him on facebook side by side with a picture of my brother in law saying I think we can all see the resemblance but throwing in that he has my eyes. I get it, but DILs dont want to hear about how their baby is a carbon copy of yours. I responded to a passive aggressive text the other day saying I just needed to be left alone for a while. She understood, or at least said she did. Then my BIL posted a picture of him when he came over for 15 minutes to help my husband with something, and thats when she plastered it on facebook without asking, i dont care that much but still telling everyone he looks just like her sons. I hate her. I dont want to hate her at all, she means well or at least did before all the comments and facebook stuff and i know shes being snooty because she thinks Im keeping him from her to be an asshole. But i literally cannot stand to see her, hear about her, and I definitely dont want to visit or have her anywhere near my house. I dont want him going anywhere without me for a while, so my husband visiting and me staying home is not happening. My husband wont talk to her. I hate myself for being so hateful and I want them to have a relationship but I cant get over it or even fake it. And now LO is starting a sleep regression and Im going to be even more irritable with less sleep in addition to reflux. Idk what Im hoping to get from this, and of youve made it this far thank you for reading. Im going to go to the Dr once I have insurance and tell them whats going on, but that might be a few weeks. Idk what to do in the meantime. Hubby loves me and says hes gonna help me through it, God bless him. But i dont want to be like this for his and my sons sake. I know Im partially in the wrong, I think its a lot of miscommunication too, but shes so emotional that we know telling her we dont want to see her so much would be a whole thing and I dont want to see her at all for while because it just makes me worse. I love my son so much, I was made to be a mama. I was not made, however, to be a part of a big social family. I dont know how to fix my hatred.",

Ive messaged my OB for a referral for a scan of my head, but do I really want to find out if something is wrong and not curable?

I was able to wean off medication fully in early 2024 and then became pregnant again shortly after. My pregnancy was going really well until the beginning of my third trimester its like a switch got flipped and I suddenly feel anxious all the time again and am unable to sleep at all without being back on medication. Im currently on Cipralex, Trazadone and Seroquel. Even with these my sleep quality and duration is poor. I often wake up in a panic. Im so incredibly scared that I wont be able to make it through this pregnancy and that Im going to experience all of the same terrible trauma I went through last time.

Knock on wood right anyway, Ive talked to my dad, therapist, and husband about this but havent felt better so I wanted to try this community to see if any of you moms have felt the same. My heart absolutely breaks at the idea of me not being able to take care of my baby Im about 14 months pp now and its pretty bad. Im convinced that Im seeing signs because I keep watching moviesshows or seeing gofundmes that involve a mothers death please tell me Im not alone and these arent signs Im going to die I mean, I know that nobody knows when theyll die. But maybe if others have experienced these same issues itll help me feel a bit better",

During my pregnancy, I had suicidal depression which i kept under wraps.I spent my lunch break crying almost every day. I would seek out spots where I could be left alone. I had also just gotten off a medication that caused some 2nd person auditory hallucinations. As the meds wore off, it got better but never entirely went away. My anxiety reached highs I never thought possible. It made me nervous to walk past another coworker if I didnt know them well, talk to them often, or work with them directly. I didnt like going anywhere in my store because of it. My hearing also got more sensitive. I am a jumpy person already but the bakers racks squeak horribly in my bakery when moved. They always made me jump or twitch my head all weird because of their high pitch sounds. Its like my nerves were shot. Fast forward to now, I am so embarrassed about how I was during my pregnancy. Im not as anxious but I still dont like going to other areas of my store. I dont look at or talk to people unless they acknowledge me first. I call out a lot and I feel like they all hate me. The ones that do like me, I feel, are tolerant of me. I absolutely love what I do, though cake decorator. I feel like most people avoid me especially, my bosses. When I leave my area, Ill do anything on my phone to avoid looking at people because i feel disliked. Im still jumpy but not as bad. My hearing is sensitive still but not as bad. Idk how to change it. It wasnt like this before medications or during my other pregnancies. This was my third pregnancy. I had anxiety before but not as bad as I do now 8 mos postpartum. Ive dealt with the depression on and off most of my life along with adhd. My first pregnancy gave me a sense of smell, almost like a dog. I still have a strong nose now. This pregnancy seems to have given me better hearing??? I felt like a different person. Did anybody else have weird pregnancy changes like these?

On October 11, 2014, after 29 exhausting hours of labor and an emergency Csection, my fianc and I welcomed a beautiful 9lbs 1oz. baby girl. For a brief moment, I felt pure relief. The worst was over, right? I could finally rest, get reacquainted with my body, and say goodbye to gestational diabetes and the dark melasma patches that had covered my arms, breasts, and belly. But that sense of relief quickly turned into overwhelm. I found myself on an emotional rollercoaster that was nothing like the blissful glow people promised. It was intense, allconsuming, and I felt like I was drowning in it. Waking up every two hours to pee during pregnancy was now replaced by waking every two hours to feed, change, swaddle, and soothe a newborn did not help. Then, just 18 months in, I became a single mom. Coparenting brought its own set of challenges, but by the time my daughter was a toddler, I felt like I had made it through the trenches with one certaintyI would never have another baby! So certain, in fact, that I went to my OB and asked her to tie my tubes. She refused, convinced that one day Id fall in love again and want another child. She also explained that many doctors hesitate to perform tubal ligations for women with only one child. So, I let it go. Fast forward almost a decade. I did fall in love again, but baby fever never hit me. In fact, when I saw firsttime pregnant women, I felt sympathy, silently hoping they knew what was coming. And moms with multiple kids? I secretly wondered if they were gluttons for punishment. As for that idea that you forget the pain of childbirth and the sleepless newborn nights? Not for me. I remembered everything vividly, and I had zero desire to revisit that chapter. Nine years later, I reignited the conversation about getting my tubes tied. This time, my doctor agreed, but she cautioned me that most doctors no longer tie tubes they now recommend completely removing them to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. That gave me pause. The idea of removing them felt too final, like Id be giving up a piece of my womanhood. I left the appointment with the option to schedule the surgery, but I never did. I told myself Id get a second opinion, but life got in the way. A new job and a new house took priority. Then, in January 2024, while sipping champagne and planning to turn the room that had once been staged as a nursery into a clothfice closetoffice, I started feeling nauseous. I brushed it off until I realized my period was late. After a few weeks of feeling off, I took a pregnancy test. Within seconds, two lines appeared. Both my partner and I had always agreed we didnt want more kids and had taken precautions to avoid that outcome. But living in a state where I still had a choice, we decided that a baby still wasnt in the plan for either of usuntil",

She had been a perfect happy baby, barely cried, and then one day I went over to my moms house and she had slept the whole ride, and when we got there she just would not stop crying. Crying to the point of her trying to catch her breath and me about to call the ambulance. I ended up rushing her to the dr and they said everything was okay nothing that they could tell was wrong. Last year I had a missed miscarriage 11wk and seeing my then 3mo daughter in distress like that scared the sh i t out of me. I felt the same panic of finding out i had a mc. I have a 3yo son as well and I did not have anxiety or anything with him on top of that my son is in a prek school and weve all been sick the past month. I am finally over it but my daughter is still congested and coughing, we have been to the doctor for a sick visit and again there is nothing they can do besides suggest humidifier, suction, etc. I feel like i cant even leave the house bc im so anxious, about her choking on her mucus or something happening. I know that she will be alright but why is this happening now. I physically feel ill if were out and she has one tiny cough.

        "input": "Heading to my primary tomorrow to talk about my mental health. Im not sure if Im actually experiencing ppd,ppa, ppr, etc, but I know something is off. My son was born in March and things have been pretty good. Im a SAHM and I was a sahw before I got pregnant. Little bit of background on my stressors Weve been going through some financial struggles the last year or two because of changes at my husbands job, Like we were doing great before his company was bought out by a bigger company. He financed a rarer vehicle its a 1996 dont get too excited but hes never financed a car before, proposed, and we planned a wedding for 6 months later. Right after he proposed and we set the date they got bought out and shtf. Took him 6 months of job searching to find somewhere else only to be let go when I was 33wks pregnant. He found a new job a week before my son was born, thankfully. I was driving Lyft to help pay bills while he was unemployed and searching. Mostly the midwife bill because my payments in the last month and a half were basically an extra mortgage. He was at that job until about a month ago because the promises of enough work to make what he was making before his first company was bought out he was paid by the book hour not hourly rate but it only got slower and slower with lots of empty promises to turn on direct repair with a major insurance company to get more work in. Hes been at the new job for 3 weeks or so, and is making an hourly rate and working OT. His first check had no OT and was finally a decent check that is helping us get caught up. Im hoping finances stop being a stressor now. The last few weeks, Ive really noticed I have no patience for anything. Im not sad, but I cry when frustrated or angry and always have. This weekend really made me think about the possibility that its more than just stress. Im not really sure. So when I do the ppd survey I score like a 47 and 12 is when they say it might be ppd. But I have been irritated as hell. So Saturday I hadnt eaten all day because its hard to find time I can eat and finally sat down to eat a bowl of soup when he went into the kitchen to get food for himself. He was pissy because we have a fruit fly issue due to me not being able to clean the dishes often enough. So I got pissed and decided that cleaning the kitchen was now more important than eating in the moment. He took our son outside with him after I screamed at him about how I feel like I cant get anything done and he needs to be more present. Sunday, I woke up at 8, walked into the bathroom to the smell of dog pee. Got pissed. Hubs let the dogs out and asked me where their food was Ive been cooking at home for them it wasnt thawed because I forgot to pull it out last night. So he gave them cat food and comes in and says I gave them some cat food. I was like wtf does some mean? Did you feed them or not? Do they still need food? Or are they good. He wasnt giving me a direct answer and I flipped. Like he was like no I just gave them some they still need food but them saying he fed them. Idk it just irritated me. Ive had thoughts about how much Im failing as a wife and mother and I finally told him today that sometimes I think itd be better if he just leaves me. My primary has previously mentioned she didnt realize she had ppd with her first until she had her second and I just dont know at all anymore. Anyone have any thoughts that could be helpful?",

TLDR This is how I kicked my ppdppaocdrages a, and i want you to do the same To those in the thick of postpartum or just regular crappy depression, experiencing the worst state of mind theyve ever had, wondering when the harmful thoughts will stop, so you can live your life to the fullest extent I have a daily list, and if you stick to it, youll kick your depressions a like I did What I found, especially with ppd, is that no one really wanted to hear about it, your loved ones will shut down the conversation because of how uncomfortable it makes them, leaving the depressed mother to feel like shes now been marooned on an island, where no light or warmth can reach it. Its all very sad, which is why I feel like its my job to help others, experiencing the same pain, as I had. This list is meant for those who are sick and tired of trying meds that never work, for those who are looking for answers that they cant seem to find. If you follow it, daily, itll work. It only takes 3 weeks to make new habit pathways in the brain, so in 3 weeks, youll be a brand new woman. Ready?? Say this outloud, and tell me how it feels. I am Powerful, so I revitalize with the Sun I am Transformation, so I replenish with Water. I am a Mother, so I honor myself as I care for others. I am Worthy, so I am aware of what goes in and on my body I am Peace, so I allow myself to rest and restore I am Life, so I breathe consciously and deeply. I am Creation, so I influence my surroundings with sound. I am Strength, so I exercise for endurance. I am Energy, so I bring awareness control to my thoughts and words. So why, right? WHY do all this? The Sun is a natural healer, vitamin D deficiency side effects, cover most ppd symptoms. Getting sun best in am will help balance hormones blood pressure, it will also help regulate serotonin, Melatonin your circadian rhythm. Water not only are we made mostly of water, but it makes up 7080 of each cell within us. Its used to energize help dump out toxins, add more water, and reignite your cellular health. Selfcare is something we honestly take for granted, but it must be prioritized as an act of self love. Having proper self care habits, literally prevent depression even cancer, thats how important it is. It also drives our selfworth, and you are so worthy of love Bringing awareness to what goes in and on our bodies, will help you understand the environmental effects your choices are having on the bodys reactions. We put so much harm on and in us, just bringing awareness to ingredients will increase mindfulness deeper understanding to cause and effects we experience. ALSO the gut creates the majority or serotonin dopamine in the body, so give yourself a fighting chance. Rest sleep its paramount we get adequate rest, so many will say theres not enough time, but we only have time for what we make time for, so always prioritize restsleep over screen time. Its not worth your mental health taking a nose dive that day. Breath is Life, so when you want to add more life to your day, breathe more deeply. Doesnt need to be excessive, just consciously add deep breaths. Our breath matches our emotions, so if you want to master your emotions, master your breath as a short cut. Sound everything carries a frequency, everything is energy. So to influence your energy, and your surroundings, quickly, add sound. Chimes, singing bowls, bells, clapping, humming, solfeggio frequencies, healing tones, classical music binaural beats, work best. Thought awareness is KEY! Our thoughts make up our feelings, and both create our day. So to create the day we want, weve gotta manipulate the thoughts we put out into the universe. No more damning ourselves with things like this is the worst or I hate... or I will never... because everything we say, creates more of it. Everything we focus on GROWS. So be careful what youre growing. Im praying this reaches all who need it, you are all so worthy of love, care and healing.

I had to go on Nifedipine for high BP after my 2nd child was born 6 months ago, this wasnt going to be forever it was only a temporary medication and I would be slowly weaned off it once out of the postpartum period 8 weeks I am now off it but during those 8 weeks I went through absolute health anxiety HELL. I was in the doctors once a week anyway for a bp check and thank god my GP genuinely cared about me because she listened to me cry about the side effects of this medication so many times. I didnt change to another medication because it was doing the right thing for my BP just had to put up with the side effects for 8 weeks. Anyway the side effect that was making me worry so much was that every single time I stood up my legs from hips downwards would flush like MAD. I have never seen anything like it, you know when you go bright red faced when nervous? It was that but on my legs, my knees would be the reddest part and BOILING hot to touch, it was as if the blood was pooling into my legs so much there was no blood anywhere else! If I stood for long enough I couldnt bend my knees or bend down they were so painful, but the minute I elevated them on the sofa, GONE. I was hating every second of making bottles or picking my baby up because of this symptom. I was on here almost everyday searching for someone else with this problem so Im hoping that this will help someone if they are worrying too.

I even studied abroad for 2 years when I was 17 and I loved this part of my life. When I came back home to pursue my studies, it felt a bit strange but I kept it together and had a pretty full social life. Then I turned 20 and my life became hell. First I started having insomnia, then I just started throwing up randomly and feeling nauseous all the time. My thoughts were eating me alive and I could not tell anyone about it. Thats when my panic attacks started. It was almost everyday before going to uni. Nonetheless, my life was perfect on paper. I am a sociable and conventionally attractive woman who just graduated from my countrys best university. So I kept pretending for a few months that everything was okay and started obsessing over fitness to the point where I lost a lot of weight. I felt palpitations continuously and could not eat without feeling like I was going to choke on my food. I would feel hot all the time and start sweating excessively, which never happened to me before. I was a complete mess and could not face my reflection in the mirror, but nobody knew. I spent the summer doing all these medical tests to find an answer, then I faced the truth last month and went to see a psychiatrist. I got diagnosed with GAD, PTSD and OCD. I take 100mg of sertraline everyday, its been 4 weeks now. I dont know how I got there. I used to be a perfectionist and a true workaholic. I was not scared of anything and always felt like I was special. Now I just feel like a waste of potential and a burden. I am screwing everythings up and I am relying on medication to stay alive. If there was a magic pill to come back to who I was a few years ago I would take it, but I know thats not possible. I cant even go out or take public transportation without feeling threatened by others. I kinda figured out how I got there, people were harsh with me for years because they thought I could take it. Well, turns out I cant anymore. The thing is, I dont know how to get out of that place, and its killing me. Its such a pity for me to say that my physical appearance is the only thing I have left, and I keep thinking about how it will one day fade away and how lonely Ill be. Maybe its the side effects of my medication making my anxiety worse for a while, but I really dont want to turn 21 with such little hope for the future. No one around me seems to understand what anxiety is really like, so I guess I wanted to reach out to people who might understand my situation or who have had similar experiences in the past.

Theres people who want me to succeed and to laugh. But I just cant do it anymore. Im tired and I feel like nothing is helping, at this point its just a coinflip whether I wake up happy or depressed. Ive also never really vented on the internet before so thats a first. Its gone so far that I made a fresh account just so I can evade my friends that follow me on my main account. I sincerely think that Ill be dead in the next 5 years, I dont care if its a war, or I get killed, or I commit suicide. I just know I wont make it past 25. Anyways thats about it regarding my situation, if any of you guys want to ask questions or just talk I dont really mind. Since it probably wont matter anyway.",

In the beginning it was just small comments. And I trusted him so I let it go. And then they got bigger and he got meaner. Eventually I was convinced nobody would ever want me so I stayed. Once we ended, he was so mean and just tore me apart. Paragraphs about how I was ugly, nobody would ever love me, he never loved me, ect. It got so bad that my parents were going to put a restraining order on him. Its been about a year and a half and im still not the same. I am trying to get myself back but it feels kind of impossible. I miss not feeling like a nuisance to everyone around me, I miss being able to talk things out with people without fear of them being mad, I miss liking myself and how I looked. I am so tired of this ruining my relationships with friends and potential relationships with guys as well. Just fucked up a talking stage with this guy I REALLY liked because I was scared to talk things out. I miss the passion that I used to have for things. I used to be so passionate about my writing and crocheting and my style and the people around me and now im just kind of here. I was so so special. Just a ray of sunshine and laughter and I made everyone around me feel so happy and special. And now im such a shell of myself. I still like crocheting and dressing up and everything but i am not as passionate about it. I am no longer kind. I am so mean to people for no reason. I am in therapy, on medication, I go for walks, I journal, but it feels like Ill just never be me again. I have goals. I work towards them and I am trying to better myself because yes, he did fuck me up but its my choice to either stay that way or get better. And I know I can get out of my depression but I dont know if Ill ever be ME again. Im not mad at him anymore. Its not productive. And i understand him. I understand why he does those things. I understand why hes so mean. I just wish I got away sooner. I wish this wasnt my first relationship. Everyone keeps telling me to forget and move on but I just cant. I cant move on when I deal with the effects of this every day of my life. And the worst part is that people dont believe me. He gets away with it. Hes on the news for some bullshit he pretends to care about and everyones like omg hes so brave for speaking up and in reality hes just pretending he cares about people. 2 of my friends still talk to him. I just want to be myself again. Be honest, will i ever be me again? Because I dont think so. I just miss myself.",

Thanks Hi, Im 21F, and I feel like sharing how I feel because Im not sure anyone around me would truly understand or even want to listen. Nobody seems to get meespecially my mom, who I unfortunately have to live with for a long time. Shes ill, possibly with bipolar disorder and other illnesses, and, sadly, shes made me a mess. Maybe even messier and angrier than she is. Yet she still doesnt understand me. I have a loving boyfriend who tells me Im the most wonderful woman hes ever met, that Im beautiful and kind, and that hes never known someone as pure as me. But I dont see that. He doesnt see the real monster I feel I amthe ugly, flawed person I see in the mirror, the face I can barely stand to look at. I hardly ever take pictures of myself I avoid mirrors as much as I can. We might get married one day, but even then, I feel haunted by the fact that I never met my father. Hes even more of a mess than I am. Who would walk me down the aisle? I dont have an uncle. I cant even face my best friend and tell her Im not who she thinks I am. I feel like a failure, like Ill never be normal. I rely on medication to stabilize my mood, and I may have to take it my whole life. My therapist doesnt seem to care about how I feelshes only concerned with my moms wellbeing, never mine. Am I not important? Not to my dad? Not to my mom? To anyone, really? I dont even know what I love, or what my favorite color or dish is. I dont know who I am or what I want to do. I feel empty, unable to put words to anything. I cant even cry. Sometimes, I dont even feel like my diagnosis is accurate. I feel messier than just bipolarlike I have an illness no ones ever identified. Its like I have maggots crawling inside me, eating me from the inside out, and all I want to do is tear my skin open to get them out. But I cant selfharm, because if my mom found out, shed just call me crazy, a failure. And with her heart condition, it could even be dangerous for her to see me that way. Im scared of death, too. I dont believe in any religion, so I have no idea what comes after. What if Im already dead? Am I just bipolar ? Or maybe I also have BDP? Maybe affective schizophrenia?

        "input": "I was assaulted by another woman and now I dont know what to do I was sexually assaulted by a woman a few weeks ago. We had casually hooked up a few times, not really knowing each other in a sober context, mostly just meeting up at college parties and making out, etc. One day she encouraged me to get high and then asked to go back to my room place. When we did she raped me. I was so high that I barely knew what was happening. I had initially consented to kissing and above the waist stuff. But she quickly grew more aggressive and it progressed to more both her touching me between the legs and using my hand to pleasure herself. Ive been sexually assaulted before by a man so I just froze, I couldnt move. When I finally came to my senses I tried to push her off of me and told her that I needed a breakto text my roommatefind my phone. I kept repeating myself but she refused to stop. I finally pushed myself up and tried to get out from under her, but she pinned her legs around me and forced me back down. I told her no, but she didnt listen and kept going. The next day my arm was sprained from being held down with it pinned behind my back. I also had visible hickeys on my neck, which made it even more triggering. When I finally got her out of my room after physically forcing her off of me she kept saying ten more minutes and continuing to make out with and touch me despite my protests. I had eventually just surrendered and lay passively while she did what she wanted I felt nothing. I washed my face and immediately went to bed, feeling uncomfortable, used, and terrified. I didnt know what had happened, or if that was normal for sex. Ive never had sex with a woman before so I didnt know. The worst part is I continued to see this girl for over a month before finally cutting things off yesterday. After this incident Id still go out with her, even though she regularly ghosted me on planned dates, blew me off, and objectified me in front of other people, treating me like arm candy and talking about me in overly sexual ways in front of people I barely knew. She also always found ways to turn our planned sober dates into affairs where both of us were drunk andor high, and when this happened she was always aggressively physical with me even though I had said Im uncomfortable with PDA in public spaces, pinning me up against wallstables and making out with me roughly. My friends noticed this and were always uncomfortable by it, and said they were worried for my safety. I brushed it off and made excuses, and kept seeing her. The day after the assault my roommate made a joke about my hickey, saying something about how it looked like Id had a fun night. I didnt know what to say. I didnt know what I was supposed to do, or what had even happened. I still feel like it was my fault. I put myself in that situation, saw the red flags and kept telling myself it was okay. Every time she did something cruel or inappropriate she would say I deserved better and apologized. I always told her it was okay, and I put up with all of it. Finally I cut it off, after she told me she didnt have the time to commit to our relationship and wasnt going to be available much. I called it quits and told her we were done. She almost cried, for some reason, even though she had practically initiated the split. Mind you, we were never officially together, just seeing each other for around two months. Im just now processing the assault after weve broken up. Id rewritten in my head to be just a bad sexual experience. Ive even lied about it to my friends about it being enjoyable, just rough. Im having a really rough time coming to terms with it, and I think Im finally feeling the effects of the trauma in full force. If anyone else has had experience with female on female assault, please let me know any advice you have. I dont know if I can continue to even say Im a lesbian, as the word leaves a bad taste in mouth now. I dont know how I can continue to date women. Anything having to do with sex just feels raw and wrong and violating. I dont understand how people can enjoy it. I walked away from my first sexual encounter wondering if I was actually asexual because of how horrific it had been. I feel like a fraud even calling myself a lesbian anymore. I dont know what I am. Any advice is graciously appreciated. Thank you. Just wondering if anyone else here has dealt with this, there doesnt seem to be a lot of resources for lesbianswomen who were rapedassaulted by other women. Im 18F, also.",

My boyfriend has a porn addiction and we addressed like three times that its cheating but he kept hiding and lying over and over. Then he said it gave him more pleasure than me and that they were better. He said he takes it all back and didnt mean any of it and wont do it again. That really messed with me, this happened maybe a month or so ago and I have been just as repulsed from sex, masturbation and ANYTHING inherently sexual. it makes me feel sick to think about. My boyfriend said its okay and to take my time and that hes willing to do anything he can to help. I am trusting that hes genuinely putting in effort to stop this addiction and I appreciate it of course, but my body and mind cant let go of what he did and said I guess.? I think its also hard, since Im feeling repulsed from it, it makes me think of more bad things that have happened in my life having to do with sex. the two main bad things I think of on top of what my boyfriend did are 1. being raped as a child repeatedly by my stepdad 2. my boyfriend being too friendly with his female friends, watching fifty shades of gray alone with them, letting his female friends show him her dildo, etc. It feels sickening that I let all this happen. It feels like theres something wrong with me. my boyfriend hasnt done anything with his lady friends in a while because he currently has none and doesnt want to pursue a friendship with ladies. he likes his male friends and it also makes me more comfortable him having just male friends so it really does work out.

I am a 21 yr old woman and he is a 28 yr old man We both like each other and are both aware, but I am in no position to date. My most recent relationship nov23 jun24 ended poorly. It was also my first real relationship. I broke it off because I relized I could not meet his needs and only felt guilt and shame when I was around him because I had an extremely low self esteem. When we started dating, he got his shit together and I wasted my time. In addition to that, I would go long periods being distant with him, then try to make up for it with acts of kindness or treats. Love bombing became a major and horrible habit for me. None of it was intentional and I truly cared for him, but I felt so much relief after I broke up with him. During that 7 month relationship, I was undiagnosed with what I now know is Bipolar Disorder, which seemed to line up with the love bombing. Looking back, I still did care for him, but not once when I said I love you did I mean it the way he did, and I relize now I still cant tell the difference between strong platonic love for someone, and attraction. Now someone is interested in me. I really like him, I really like spending time with him, and I dont feel ashamed if myself with him, but I cant do that again. When he confessed the way he felt, I told him I felt the same way, because I do, but I fear Im doing the same thing again. I never dated in highschool and have no desire for anything besides close platonic physical contact with anyone I have ever known. Im medicated now, but extremely irregulated and emotionally volatile. Im terrified that if he sees me as more than a friend, hell see the kind of neglectful asshole I am because Im too absorbed in my own problems to care for another person.

        "input": "Do I have emetophobia? Hi everyone, I would really appreciate if you could read or skim this and help me out a bit. The past couple of years have been rough on my mental health and I couldnt figure out the cause. It all started when I had a bad hangover for the first time ever mind you I never really drank so it was new to me as I was on a train. I felt like I had to throw up for 2 hours straight, and there was nothing I could do about it. I was panicking and my anxiety was to the roof. A few days later I started having random panic attacks and I would start shaking and every time I tried to think of something happy or positive, it just didnt work. So now I was depressed because of that, I mean nothing really brought me the same joy as it did before. Fast forward a bit and it started to get kind of better, I didnt drink or do anything to make me feel like I did on the train. Its been 1.5 years since the train and things have been all right not terrible but not the same level of happiness before. All until I threw up, and this was not because of alcohol. Exactly one month ago from writing this post, I went to the gym and went past my limits and I also ate some granola and potentially expired milk, I dont remember. All I remember is the horrifying feeling of oh god im gonna throw up and it you just knew there was no stopping it. The uncomfortable feeling of choking while my stomach acid is burning in addition to the severe panic made me almost faint. I had to slowly lay flat on the ground to calm down. Now within the month after this happened, I have felt so mentally low with many panic attacks where I shake uncontrollably and essentially dont see a clear future as bad as that sounds. I mean if this is what life is going to be then what is the point. I am constantly doing everything in my power to not ever feeling like I did a month ago, because that was hell. I am scared nothing will work to help this but I want to be back to my normal self. I was so happy and enjoyed life, and now I cant enjoy anything without worrying. To conclude this, from anyones experience, do I have emetophobia? And whether I do or not, can this get better to the point where I can enjoy life again? Additional notes I am currently seeing a psychiatrist but he doesnt know about this whole throwing up thing yet, and I will not ever consider suicide, but I would give anything in the world to make this better.",

I was in dangerous situations from a young age, as I grew to a teenager, I put myself in a lot other dangerous situations with my temper and lack of control, and ego. Ive been in a lot of altercations. Ive been attacked many times, Ive attacked people many times in retaliation. Ive been jumped, beaten, kicked and stabbed at different times in my youth. Ive lived a beautiful life for the last 2 and a half years or so now. I survived. Today I feel like random people who I just met are untrustworthy or trying to take something from me. I dont let anyone walk behind me Ive been jumped from behind, I cant trust anyone and Im always in a state of tension and readiness. My mind has cleared up a lot, Ive talked thru a lot of the flashbacks and situations where mepeople I love were almost killed. Im very hopeful for the future and I live a good life, I cleaned up, got off drugs, went to college. Im doing great. The faces of my old enemies began to not startle me anymore when I would see them in my head. But I cant just relax. Im lying in bed rn, and the last thought I had was about an older man I met for the first time today, he literally was so nice and we had a good conversation I was thinking about this as I lay down but then my head comes out with if he tries to fuck me over Im gonna kill him. For context, Im a fit 19 year old man. He was far older and smaller than me. This thought made absolutely no sense. Why do I see innocent people as a threat? Its not like I always see them this way but I cant get the smoke to clear when the mood takes me. My brain just said why would this random man be nice to you and it immediately became defensive. I come from a place where most people are extremely friendly unless you make enemies with them. Its like I think everyone has an agenda, things they want that theyd be willing to fuck me over for. AND I KNOW ITS NOT TRUE I KNOW ITS NOT TRUE. I have been shown so many times that it is not true. It makes me feel like I truly am mentally ill, Ive never known anything different. Ive always been an upbeat guy, laughing all the time. When I was a child, before things happened, I used to only ever laugh or cry, there was nothing in between. I was always an intense kid. So maybe that doesnt help. I just want so badly to come home and actually believe that the fighting is over, but Im so UP all the time. It takes so little to set me off but the thing is I dont even realise Im set off. Its just normal to me. And then I realise people are afraid of me, intimidated. Cos Im in fight mode. Last night I couldnt sleep, and I was sick for the whole day, my stomach was so weak and nervy. I felt cold. My body wouldnt stop tho. Adrenaline kicked in at around 10am, just after I rested while on public transport for a while. God I dont know. I just wanna come home. It hurts me so much that people I love are afraid of me when they feel the intensity. They dont realise that in that moment Im actually a lot more scared than they are and theres no good reason why anymore, its been over for years, theyre not coming anymore. But Im just scared. My body is scared.",

So Ive had a look online at some information about PTSD or CPTSD and in some regards it seems like I might fit, but in other cases Im not sure. For example, Ive never suffered abuse or anything like that, my family are great. So I thought I might share my experience and see if anyone here can offer any advice, if thats okay. When I was 13, I suddenly got really ill. I would feel like I was gonna be sick almost constantly, no matter what I was doing but I think it mightve been worse when I ate. We had a lot of tests, for celiac disease and lactose intolerance, but couldnt figure out what was going on. I dunno how much I weighed but I wasnt eating and my weight dropped. Then after 2 months in December 2013 my appendix ruptured, so it looks like it was that all along. Not long after that I started having trouble eating, like there was a mental block, it was really difficult every time I ate so I avoided it a lot. Then I started to have OCD symptoms like having routines about everything and obsessing about the possibility of being sick. Things got worse and worse until I had to go into the psychiatric ward in 2015. I was there for 3 months, and by the time I left the eating problems and the OCD seemed to have receded. But after I left, I realised that I no longer seemed to feel emotions or enjoyment about anything. I dont know when it happened or how or why but at some point while I was at hospital I went from crying every day to now having not cried in over 9 years. Im just numb all the time, I dont enjoy anything or have any interests or passions or anything. The OCD and eating problems have returned but in slightly different guises, along with depression, and nothing seems to help, not therapy CBT, TherapyForYou, counselling, group OCD therapy, art psychotherapy and currently seeing a private therapist or medication Sertraline, Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Vortioxetine and probably others Ive forgotten or anything. I had EMDR but the lady ended up stopping it because it wasnt doing anything. So now Im stuck, I have no energy or drive to do anything, even the stuff people suggest like exercise or trying new things.

Ill be 39 when my daughter graduates high school. I just hope that Im good enough for my kids, that I can raise them well and given them the patience, understanding and support they need. I feel that if I had even been 5 years older it would have made a difference in my confidence. It seems that other parents have things figured out and are doing a much better job than I am. And I constantly find myself in the sweet moments thinking that its already coming to an end, that my kids wont be little for much longer. If I had waited, Id have little kids for a longer time.

When I was 8 I lived alone with my dad for a year, and all I know from that is that it wasnt good. I went to therapy when I was 11 and already then I couldnt remember the year with my dad. Now, Im doing a lot better, Im stable and pretty mentally healthy. I think thats why the lost year has suddenly kinda resurfaced. I havent been in touch with my dad in years, but wished him happy birthday a week or so ago, and since then things have kind of been chaotic. I want to remember what happened. After I moved away to stay with my mom, I was broken. Suicidal, depressed, I had daily panic attacks and nightmares most nights, and I was only 10. Its just not normal, and it makes me think something might have happened to make me that way. I know he was verbally abusive, and I was neglected pretty bad that year, but that doesnt kinda seem extreme enough for how bad I got? There are also these snippets that make me worried I might have been assaulted, but I was 8 and its 20 years ago now, so how do I even trust whatever fragments I get ahold of??

My parents have sunk deep into the American political world so I choose not to speak to them so I dont get dragged in. They all sound like legitimate reasons to me. We did discover that I have another sibling though. It was eye opening but honestly not shocking. I know everyone kind of lost their minds and I was justmeh. I didnt make the decision. It has nothing to do with me really. They want to meet me but why? There have been these kind of bombshells all year from spare siblings we didnt know about to major medical diagnoses. Heart attack, mini stroke, to a cancer scare. Im still waiting to hear about that last one. We find out this year if well be moving next year which will mean a total upheaval of our lives. A change of not just jobs but continents. And. I. Dont. Care. That cant be healthy. But do I want anything to change? Do I want to lose my mind the way the rest of the family is? Do I want to fall into an existential crisis by questioning my parents almost 50 year marriage? Do I want to stay up worrying about how the rest of my family will take it if we lose that family member? Yes I know Im probably more detached than I should be but what other choice is there? I dont want to start screwing with my meds. It took too long to get me here. And is all that mental drama worth it when I really like my life as it is now? Yes I miss my highs. I miss my creativity and the fun I would have. But this way I dont fall into those depressive episodes where I cant get out of bed for months at a time.

I went to the house and asked the couple for rabies paperwork. They were an older couple and said they are their dogs but their daughter takes care of all of that. They contact daughter who has the vet send her their rabies info and she sends it to me. The date on the paperwork is 1162023. Granted, the bite happened on 1172024. My question was is the paperwork date the expiry or the date given? So I call the vet. The vet says yes, it expired 1162024. One day before the bite. If you want to get technical, like 10 hours before the bite. So I verify, okay, so he got a one year rabies vaccine? Vet says no, he got a 3 year, but we always recommend a one year. Im in Texas just fyi I ask so if we are going to be technical, based on what you just said, the dog is current on his rabies vaccine? And she says yes. So why is my anxiety still up in arms? The dogs rabies was expired for ONE DAY. 10 HOURS. I know in my head rabies vaccines just dont go poof and they are just severely susceptible. Even so, if the dog had bit me 11 hours before and it was current, how much of a difference would that have made? Does anyone see where Im going with this? So, whats your thoughts?

Ive been at a mental decline for months now before I could self regulate and be happy for months at a time but its hard when you are constantly shot while trying to get up. For starters I lost my boyfriend which sucks but who cares then I found out I have stage 4 endometriosis and cant have kids. Ive been experiencing pain associated with that since I was 10. Then I found out I wasnt going to have a job because they werent accepting transfers 4 weeks before I was moving 3 hours away. It took me 1 month to find a job and it doesnt pay anything close to what I was making before. I pay for my college as well as my rent with no help bc Im not eligible for fafsa or any aid bc my mom claimed me. Ive been here since Aug and I havent made any friends and Im really into manifesting and had good results before but that has really let me down. Im running out of money and i probably will have to drop out soon bc I have to choose between school or a place to stay. My old friends never reach out and I always have to which makes me feel like shit. I want to get help and talk to someone bc i really dont see the point in living and never really have. It sucks when you dont really even need much just friends and money and I cant even get that. I always feel like I am a burden to people when I asked for help bc I get treated that way. I bring up anything and its pls dont do this again bc I tried to kill myself when I was 12 because I was heavily getting sexually assaulted and bullied at school and by family. And plus who wants to hang out with a depressed person. I pretend to be happy and force myself to see the positive in everything and self regulate but it isnt working anymore. I cant keep pretending when nothing is improving. Ill just cry every night and wish my life would change for the better.

I do wish I was dead. I want to see my kids grow up. But Im a horrible mother. My house is a mess. Im behind on a million things. I dont know how to keep on top of anything and I dont have a job so how do I do this with a job if I ever get one? Im applying to admin roles and I wont get those as I dont have 35 years admin experience. Im useless. How can I just disappear? How can I give my family a good life? Do I become an escort or something? Im running out of ideas.",

        "input": "Panic disorder, medication and insight practicenonduality Hi all, Ive suffered from generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks and derealization for years. It comes in episodes, and I recently just went through one of the worst episodes of my life, lasting for a few weeks. Ive never used medication before, but finally broke down and saw a psychiatrist during this recent episode and got prescribed some meds. The panic attacks are characterized by this intense feeling of being trapped inside of reality. I have no way to describe it other than that. In the past Id have a panic attack, but then be able to sort of get back to living life and forget about it. The problem during this most recent episode was that the idea of reality itself became a trigger I am always inside reality, which means I am always trapped. I know this may be incomprehensible to most people, but these thoughts and panic attacks induced real shifts in perception derealization where I perceive in my direct experience that I am literally trapped inside 3D space in the present moment. I am trapped inside experience itself. So for about 2 weeks I was in a state where I felt trapped like 247. Couldnt eat, couldnt sleep, constantly either panicking, in constant anxiety, or ruminatingobsessing over these thoughts and my direct experience of being a beingconsciousness who is inside of experience. The psychiatrist prescribed me mirtazapine, prozac and propranolol. At this point Ive had 6 nights of mirtazapine 15 mg and today was my second morning of prozac 10 mg. Ive taken propranolol only twice and dont plan to take it for daily use unless needed. 3 days ago I felt okay, yesterday I felt decent for much of the day, and today Im feeling normal in a way I havent felt in a long time. Reality itself doesnt feel threatening, and the thought about being inside reality that was triggering panic is not doing so. I should also add that Im very into meditation, Buddhism and exploration of direct experience, so all during this episode I was practicing all kinds of insight practices to explore my experience and see how suffering was being created. At times it felt like there were minor epiphanies that led to a momentary release of suffering, but I kept finding myself back at that place of being trapped inside reality. My questions 1 Id like to believe that my recent comedown was due to progress Id made by studying my direct experience, but if Im honest that is probably wishful thinking. Its probably the meds. But which one is working? As I said above, Ive only been on mirtazapine for 6 days nightly and this is only my second morning of prozac. But today is the first day where I feel normal. I dont feel high, I feel just completely grounded and normal. Could it be that the mirtazapine is helping, or maybe even the Prozac is already hitting on day 2? Ive heard these meds can take weeks to take effect. To have something work on day 2 seems highly unlikely. Yet I feel so grounded and normal today. The following questions are more for those who are into meditation, spirituality, studying direct experience. 2 How do you reconcile your struggles with anxietypanic disorders with your desire to walk the path? Im left feeling a bit defeated the states of suffering I went through were unbearable, even though I did my best to practice equanimity and acceptance. I feel defeated that I have to use medication and was unable to overcome these states on my own. Further, Im a big believer in studying direct experience to understand the truth of reality and how we create our suffering. Yet how can I reconcile the validity of studying direct experience with these states of strong derealization where Im perceiving reality to be a certain way i.e. that I am trapped? During the episode I searched everywhere for a self who was trapped but couldnt find him. Yet it still felt like there was an I somewhere in experience who was trapped. 3 Finally, how am I supposed to move forward with this knowledge I have? This knowledge that there is indeed some truth to the idea that I am a part of reality. In a way, that is true. Right now, it is not a threat. But clearly it has beencan be a trigger that can make my life miserable. And yet its still true. Im beginning therapy next week with a nondual therapist, and am hoping I can make some progress on my integration of this basic fact of life that I have been unable to integrate for over a decade and a half. Will I be forever dependent upon medication to keep me from panicking at this basic fact of life? 4 Can anyone relate to this? This perceptiontrigger of being part ofinside of reality? I know it sounds bizarre, but it was my direct experience. Anyone else who is walking the path care to share their experience?",

I woke up the next morning in her room not knowing anything bad had happened until I heard her on the phone to the police. Condoms with my DNA were found inside the room. A part of me is angry and upset that people are like that out there, but I know of the evil in the world and have read about much worse. I feel like Ive got over this. Im also upset that I wasnt more demanding of answers from police. I understand this was my brain in defence mode and believing it wasnt true to protect myself. Im angry at my friend for totally abandoning me when I was extremely drunk. Shes not in my life anymore, she was always a shit friend and I should have never trusted her.

All my live I have been riddled with anxiety and it really has had me in a chokehold for many, many years. The last 3 years of my life had been the darkest and it truly seems surreal I can look back on it and SEE it and am starting to understand it for what it is. It really had full control of me, my mind, my body, my thoughts, my voice and the choices I made. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and Im starting to really see it and most importantly feel it. Medication and therapy did kickstart this for me and the most awful times turned into just about bearable but life still wasnt enjoyable, it gave me that tiny bit of mental strength to begin questioning what is happening? Why is this happening? Is this really me?. These questions initially scared me and my mind was telling me all the wrong answers to them, trying to instil false reasoning like Im just born this way or its because of what Ive witnessed, how Ive been treated, theres nothing I can do Im stuck like this and Ive just gotta bear with it for however long till I meet my demise. This is all not true and Im really starting to realise and believe all these reasons of why am I like this was all something in me that was bigger, stronger and something I was simply identifying with involuntarily. My mind had tricked me for years controlling my emotions, reactions what I think, how I see things and how I should represent myself, I just wasnt the real me that I was tricked into believing. It took me a very long time to reach this point but there is a you thats in there, it just needs to be accessed. A major factor in this turning in a more positive direction has been reading and talking to people who have unlocked their real being. A book I can massively thank and couldnt suggest more is The Power of Now. Reading many posts on here I can whole heartedly relate to the many of people that are struggling with their own battle with anxiety and depression. I wanted to share this just in case it helps anyone like its begging to help me, Ive still got a long way to go but Ive finally started to get on a road that Im moving down and wouldnt wish any of what Ive experienced on a soul in the world. I realised it was only me that can change this and no other intervention was just going to solve any of my problems. It starts with you.

He insists i did nothing wrong, I also can appreciate he was quite avoidant attachment type which has been hard for me as an anxious attachment type from abandonment trauma. I am really struggling to cope with the fact hes abandoned me regardless of the reason. It was really abrupt and also really upsetting to see him that unwell and that I was unknowingly a burden to him. Weve talked it out, Ive been given all the answers I need, he broke up with me in the kindest most compassionate way, but regardless i am still extremely disregulated and struggling and given me a big ptsd flare up for weeks now, with little signs of improvement. Ive done all the healthy things reach out to others, exercise, eat well, go outside, distract yourself, attempt to convince myself I deserve better, get on waiting lists for therapy, go no contact, get support from charities, try to be my own boyfriend. But I still end up feeling chronically unsafe and scared, Im in my final year of uni and im getting into dangerous territory with my fine art degree reaching nearly a month being away every time I go in, I have a flare upflashback to when I was a child, or when I make work, I think it subconsciously triggers things and I recieved a diagnosis for ptsd yesterday. To know the most important person in you life has chosen to live it without you, to be not as terrified of loosing you as you were about them, is a really difficult feeling with my past of abandonment I experienced as a child after facing SA.

I am unsure what could fully be causing this because I have been driving for around 6 months to a year now. One problem I am also having about this is that I have been wanting to hang out with my boyfriend, but Ive been in this challenging spot where I dont like to drive a lot and i dont fully know how to verbalize these thoughts correctly, and I feel like he gets frustrated because he has to drive a lot.. I can understand his thoughts, but is there a better way I can explain to him how Im feeling about this?",

Tw gun violence A little over a month ago, 28F was walking my dog behind my house, a neighborhood where lve lived for years without ever feeling unsafe. Suddenly, a man wearing a ski mask holding a gun appeared from around the corner, pointing it at my face and demanded I hand over my dog. Honey a 3 year old French Bulldog Something took over me and I instantly refused and used my body to protect her. He pulled the trigger right at my face, but nothing happened. He seemed surprised and tried again but it still didnt go off. Then he lunged and started hitting me in the head with the gun, telling me to stop screaming and trying to rip her away her from me. I kept screaming, and eventually, he fled. Honey and I were able to run in to a neighbors house for safety. For the first four weeks, I was in shock, unable to fully process what actually happened. I started therapy, and things felt ok enough that I was eager to jump back into work. Im absolutely terrified to walk my dogs or leave my house with them now but that didnt come to much of a surprise given what happened. But the past week Ive become irritable and deeply resentful toward people close to me who havent reached out or shown any support. So many friends and people from our local frenchie meet up group have acted as if this never happened and tbh really dont seem to care at all. Ive only getting 3 4 hours of sleep a night this week and during the day at work I felt nauseous and had body aches. But I assumed I was just getting sick or something. On my day off today, I felt completely fine! however, as soon as was in bed and thought about having to put on a face and be away from honey at work tomorrow.. instantly all my symptoms, especially the nausea, hit me like a train and I started to have flash backs which lead to a panic attack. I definitely see now that this is PTSD. Im wondering if the resentment I feel toward people who havent shown any support will eventually go away or if its something Ill carry forever? I dont necessarily want to hold on to it, but thinking that l could have died and people close to me and honey dont seem to care makes me feel a level of hurt I cant even describe and tbh I dont know if I even want people like that in my life. I work two jobs, but my boyfriend has been incredibly supportive, encouraging me to slow down and focus on healing while he takes care of bills etc. Im considering quitting one of my jobs, but Ive only been there for three months, and as a chronic peoplepleaser, I feel extremely guilty about leaving.

I had my suspicions for some years that I was because my depression never really felt like normal depression but something much deeper and sometimes much darker. Its been a lot to process.

There has been a lot of finding out and thinking back to a lot of things, just going that makes sense now, that adds up. Between those feelings, a lot of things started to add up as to why when I felt a certain way in a depressive episode, I had no explanation as to why I felt that way, I just felt that way for no actual reason. Recently I had, what I am realizing now a mixed episode that is a big reason that I decided to be very open and vulnerable in therapy about how Ive been feeling and how low the lows truly do get. Ive been looking back at things and the signs of it were always there and a lot of times I just said I was going through a lot I have had dealt with a lot of trauma and it was nothing else other than that.

I thought about it, and decided to go for it and apply. Because you dont know if you dont try right? Well a month passed since I applied, and I started to be ok with everything. I felt like it was indicative that it wasnt my time. They went with someone else. I had moved on and was content with at least putting my name in the hat. Everything changed on Wednesday. I got notified I moved onto the next stage of the interview process and was given the preinterview assignments. Suddenly, I felt the biggest pit in my stomach. I didnt understand the questions. The more I thought about the job, I delved into a panic attack. I didnt eat much. I cried so much. I felt like my world was ending. I got feedback from a few other upper managers at my job and I got a variation of do whats right for you, but whats the harm in doing the assignments? and after a while I started to agree with them. I thought to try to do the assignments, but when I tried all the panic attack feelings came back. I felt so much dread. I just couldnt do it. I think theres something to be said about feeling this way about a job I dont even have and theres no guarantee I would get it. I dont think its wrong acknowledging that its not the right fit, that Im content in my current position, and I dont want to move up the ladder at this moment in time. But I struggle with being a people pleaser and the feeling like I let people down. And thats what I felt like, I felt like I was letting those around me down for not going for it. But I had to do whats right for me. I let the proper personnel know that the job was not a good fit for me, I thanked them for the opportunity, and I wished them all the luck in finding the best candidate. I got a response from a top management telling me they understood, but they really encouraged me to do the assignment, that my background would help me and its supposed to be difficult. And all those feelings of feeling like I let someone down came back up. I dont want to leave this place. Its not perfect, but I dont hate my job. Im content, I have a good group of people around me. It just doesnt feel right to change jobs. The grass isnt always greener on the other side. My biggest fear is what if I get this job, but six months in I realize it wasnt a good fit, but I cant go back to my old job.

        "input": "Objectificationpressuringcoercion triggers Hi all, my first post here. Ive been in therapy since early this year and was diagnosed with PTSD related to prior sexual abuse. Ive been seeing a therapist and were beginning prolonged exposure therapy. I also got into a new relationship within the last year and its been really difficult for me to manage these new symptoms. Trigger warnings of SA and self harm When I was 15, I began dating a guy a few years older than me. This was my first sexual relationship and I was excited and very interested in sex for the first time. Throughout our almost 2 year relationship, we definitely had your average vanilla teenage sex but mixed in was a lot of emotional and sexual abuse that Ive been uncovering this year. Ive always had a knowing that I was sexually abused by this person but specific memories didnt really come to mind until this year when I was retraumatized. I have had several sexual partners since this abusive relationship and didnt really feel triggered but now the triggers seem everywhere. During this relationship, I experienced a lot of pressuring and coercion. Sometimes he would accept my no and cheat as a result. Sometimes he would threaten to self harmcommit suicide if I didnt do as asked then show me proof. Sometimes he would just do things during sex and I felt I didnt have a choice. That fawning response still haunts me and used to confuse me if I was actually assaulted or not especially because it was over a long period. I was coerced into complying with nude photos as an underage teen. I was taken remote places in his car and had to comply to sex, I was yelled at during and afterwards if I didnt seem into it because I was dissociating and waiting for it to be over. I would try to push him off of me or stop him and he would pin my face and arms down as he was much larger than me. I have had intrusive images, nightmares and hyper vigilance from my current boyfriend overstepping a boundary during sex 7 months ago. I got angry at first then disbelief and betrayal, crying and just numb, not wanting to be touched at all. The next time we had sex I was so scared and almost in tears when in that position. I struggle with feeling like he really understood the gravity of the situation for me and I comforted him a lot afterwards. He hasnt crossed a boundary again and we have good conversations about what we both want in bed. I was having a lot of hyper vigilance and rumination about being unsafe and taken advantage of by him after that. I would dissociate at any sign of being unsafe. My therapist initially thought I had OCD. Symptoms have improved with therapy. Once that settled, Im now really aware of my triggers but having all the discomfort, unease and scared feelings coming with them. I know these are signs of progress but its still so difficult to be in a relationship and have this happening so suddenly and trying to to explain my pulling back or irritability related to it. I feel my partner is sometimes supportive and he understands I have PTSD. Other times I feel like he just keeps going and going with the sex talk and it becomes really triggering for me. Sex is very important to him and really makes him feel connected. Repeatedly bringing up how hot I am or explicit language about acts on my body can feel very objectifying and pressuring for me. Whats prompted this post is him asking what panties Im wearing 3 days this week and getting really hyped to have sex again. I feel disgusted, uncomfortable or scared hell be mad at me instead of being turned on. It makes anticipated sex feel less exciting and more pressuring and like I owe it. Ive felt scared about being pressured into things I dont want to do even though hes reassured me he does not want that. But he has made jokes about this, which feels triggering and makes me scared. I feel my trauma has really impacted my comfort levels with any sexual exploration now even though I have in the past. Im sad and frustrated that this happened over 10 years ago and like I cant have a normal sex life like everyone else. During sex I can thankfully enjoy it most of the time. Just posting as Im wondering if others experience a lot of sensitivity around anything that feels like pressure or objectification. Im realizing how much the emotional abuse really played into what I experienced. I appreciate anyone reading. I move forward knowing theres hope to a normal life again.",

Fortunately when the nurses and doctor came to see me I finally broke down. When the security guard showed up and I was told Id be transferred to an inpatient center. Fortunately it was a very positive experience, if painful to get there. The center was definitely well run and patient centric. After giving me some Adavan and crashing for a day I was able to participate in groups and therapies for the next couple of days.

My ex was doing it all, all kinds of violence. But that wasnt what broke me. I broke up with him and he contacted all my friends to send them nudes of me. He blackmailed me to my employer and I got dismissed without further notice. He blackmailed me to my government. His claims Im a prostitute. Im on drugs. I publish porn. I publish child pornography of my own child, I put my child on drugs. He put some videos of my child on pornhub that he took when my child was roaming around in a diaper on a sunny day. This is all really horrible per se. He nuked my whole social circle. But I was like fuck it and started a new life. I started dating my partner. Our anniversary is in 5 days. Right now he is working a lot and it throws me back to when he was working a lot in February but he was so shitty. He just came to eat what I cooked,To put dirty dishes in the sink. He also was using my computer cos his one was broken at the time so I was really isolated too. Whenever he had free time he went out with his uni friends without me. In April I found out he said ily to all his female friends and the girls he went out drinking with all the time. I have massive cptsd. Partly from what I went through in my previous relationship but the fact that he kicked me while I was on the ground amplifies my cptsd and just throws it completely out of dimension. Next month it will be a year ago that he treated me like shit, too. I was on a vacation with my mom shortly after we started dating and he ghosted me, partied the whole time, slept over at friends, battery on 1. Later I went through his phone that he was texting everyone including random girls like one for days 247 even but me and he even gave his ex a birthday present for her bday last December. This I only found out in may. This year my birthday comes around and hes too broke toCome up with a gift on time. It was in September. Every time my cptsd is triggered I shut him out. And he has no EQ to know how to deal with it and everything just gets worse like right now.He has a lot of work right now and even tho he isnt acting like he used to but I keep having intrusive thoughts, spiralling thoughts like all the bad events accumulating in an endless loop and I know its my trauma. He has no clue what is going on with me but Im so on fire I literally wanna pack my bags and just leave the country with my son. Our anniversary is in 5 days and all I can think is I cant do another year like this. December will come and I will be so depressed about the anniversary of memories. And I shut him out I wont even talk to him because I dont feel safe to trust him with the pain I have because of what he did to me after my previous relationship. He witnessed it all. He was my friend during that time and the fact that he did that after I was so maliciously abused is hurting me more than the actual abuse. I dont wanna play victim here.

        "input": "Just need to get this off my chest I start a new med today and I am a combination of fearful and optimistic. Its the first time an antipsychotic has been added to my regimen, and in a weird way, it feels like I failed. Im in danger of losing my job for the millionth time thanks to this cursed disorder so Im getting desperate to find a way to live better with these mood swings and stay employed and safe. Some background I had my first manic episode in 2016, absolutely spurred by SSRIs, and while I almost made the ultimate permanent decision to depart the planet, I was able to get help and that led to my bipolar I diagnosis, and the real work began. With proper support and meds, and essentially quitting alcohol, I stabilized for the most part by 2019. But then 2020 happened, and as someone who lives in the US during such an intense time, I backslid in a big way with my mental health. For the last 4 years Ive been going up and down like a yoyo, on an overall downward trajectory. Ive cycled through multiple trades jobs since then, and early this year landed a carpentry job. I love the work so much, am learning a lot, and my natural creativity is a boon to this work. Unfortunately, my boss who I was friends with before getting the job, and still am had to talk with me about my mood swings. It was done kindly but firmly, and I dont resent him in the slightest, but I am embarrassed and dejected about still feeling like a friggen slave to this disorder. So for the last 4 years, Ive said no to many medications because of the work I do. Im highly sensitive to medication changes, even small adjustments make me feel off for a few weeks. So even when things are extra activated, Im still refusing to try new meds that can possibly help. My refusal is always based on the demands of capitalism and the potentially lifeending tools and machines I use as a tradie. I cant be dizzy or sleepy or jumpy when using a table saw or router, its unsafe for me and others in the shop on the job site. So I am always saying no to med adjustments so I can try to keep my head clear lol, until last week. As an American, and a leftist at that, the last few weeks have been especially hellish. I saw myself spiraling, and foolishly thought I was masking it well enough at work, so I was crushed when my boss had to have a talk with me, as Im apparently killing the morale. Real, but ouch, but real. I had a depressing revelation after that talk, when discussing with my psychiatrist what happened at work and how my mental health is tanking I dont know if I can do work like this much longer. I kept choosing to stay on the current regimen of meds so I can safely use the tools of my trade, but my mood is canceling out any progress I make in my jobs. It feels like there is no job in existence that wouldnt make my mental health worse. And believe me, Ive tried to do a little bit of everything. Im almost fucking 40 and still dont know where I belong, and feel like any progress I make in a job is dashed upon the rocky shore of cold reality as soon as my mood becomes too intense to mask. I dont know what to do and Im heartbroken. Just needed to vent. And Im crossing all my fingers and toes hoping that this new antipsychotic will help balance my broken brain so that MAYBE someday I can actually have a career, or at the very least, not have to live paycheck to paycheck.

        "input": "First timer anxiety panic attack I would like to go see a doctor but its Saturday morning and my usual GP I go to only opens on Monday. Should I go to a different GP just to get help or should I wait it out to go see a doctor that knows my history? A little backstory. I have been suffering with chronic muscle pain for years. 12 years to be accurate I have seen multiple doctors and specialists regarding this and theyre still trying to pin point what exactly is the matter. Note that I have only actively started looking intotreating the muscle pain for the last 5 years. And I can only afford to see a specialist once a year max so it is a slow progress. Now these passed three weeks I have been noticing signs of anxiety. Tight chest, numb feeling which are also symptoms of my chronic muscle pain. Buttt I also started getting really angry and irritated for no reason, I started feeling dizzy all the time and the tight chest felt more like a tight heart than the usual tight chest I get from my chronic pain. So last night, my fianc wanted to go shower, and I switched off the geyser to save electricity. This is a common thing for us to do. He got a little irritated because getting out of a cold shower, even if its a common thing for us to do to switch off the geyser, you really hate yourself a bit for not checking if the geyser was on. When I say he got a little irritated, I really mean a LITTLE, his reaction was minor and it completely tipped me over. I started with a cramp to the side of my rib cage, which is also common with my chronic pain, however this crampspasm felt minor to what Im usually used to. Shortly after the crampspasm my heartbeat started rising and I got even dizzier and a bit more shakier. I immediately started crying and I didnt understand why I was crying. I started getting irritated for being silly for crying for no reason and then I started to struggle to breath and this set off another sense of panic and overwhelmingness. A little while after I realised this may be a panicanxiety attack and I need to calm myself down. I tried getting my breathing under control and I would eventually start breathing fine but still left traumatised. A little after that the breathing situation would flare up again and then I had to try and relax and focus on my breathing. This happened approximately 911 times within the next 90minutes or so I was obviously not concerned about time or keeping a tally during this time. I obviously spent a bit of time on google after I managed to stay calm and breath normally again and most articles recommended seeing a doctor to make sure it was in fact and anxietypanic attack and not some other underlying issue. Now the problem is that I know I have chronic pain and a different GP thats not familiar with my personality nor my history might request a bunch of tests which could potentially lead to a delayed diagnosis andor unnecessary expenses the unnecessary expense part is pretty important for me right now, I mean were getting married soon and were paying for it ourselves. But also, Monday still feels pretty far away and Im not even sure if I will get that appointment on Monday theres a possibility my doctor may only have an opening Tuesday or Wednesday. So what do I do? And if anyone has any helpful tips please send them this way, Im scared to go back to that place of pure panic and I still dont feel 100 comfortable to go by my day.",

I cant tell if Im in denial of me possibly having PTSD or if Im using it as some sort of excuse. I do not ever go into his bathroom. The only time Ive done so is when I was drunk and decided to apologize for not finding him quicker and feeling like Im to blame for his death due to me taking him to the hospital months before to find out a tumor was growing inside of him. I rarely even go into his room. Theres not a day where I dont think about finding him. Its so hard to think of him in a positive light because its all I see in my head recently. Even when Im out with friends or family, the image randomly pops up into my mind. I dont feel like the person I know I am anymore. Im usually very empathetic and willing to help others where I can but lately, Im angry and can barely pretend to care about hearing about someone elses issues. I do not get checked up on by family members ever since he passed and I feel like thats part of why Ive become such a negative person all over again I went through this same phase when my mother passed away.

Most recently I sought out adhd testing, sure it is something wrong with my brain. The psychologist is adamant I cant have adhd because it is developmental and that I have ptsd caused by my husband. Not earth shattering considering he had extreme reactions including punching holes in our house walls and leaving erratically saying he was going to commit suicide, leaving me with a small 2 year old crying. I left this summer when his aggressive behavior made my kids cry and scared, not to mention my nervous system. He would not let me leave or go without constant communication. He swore he would change, found quite literally 4 therapists he was seeing all at the same time. I asked him to leave so we could come home, he agreed, then did not leave. Now its back to the old ways. His presence triggers me so I try to peacefully avoid him and protect myself. This morning he came homeI never know when to expect this so I gave my earplugs handy, said hi, I said hi, and he said I said HI. I said I said hi and removed myself to another room. He came in and said we have some administrative things to take care of. I say ok, he tells me, I say ok. He goes upstairs and texts me I have a few things to get off my chest. We need to talk later. This elevates me and I tell him it is unfair that he does that especially first thing in the morning. I finally just go upstairs to ask him what he needs to get off his chest, extremely elevated at this point. And he wont tell me, we need to schedule a time to talk later. I continue to ask him to please just tell me the bullet points. He refuses and continues to lecture me about how all of this is harder for him because he has an anxious attachment. He regularly has meetings with me where he is the only one who talks. Look, I know he has zero care for me, its all about control. Shortly later he slammed a door very loudly to the point both my kids said they were scared. How can I survive in this environment while making a plan to leave?

Both my grandmas had cancer, my uncle has been diagnosed with cancer recently I think not too sure on details but my family never tell me anything my grandmas sister died of cancer before my grandma was even born she died at 2 years old of cancer. Basically what Im saying is that because theres such a long history of cancer my mother had an operation to have her ovaries removed so she wouldnt be at risk of cervical cancer. Also not to mention me and my sister are potentially very screwed over as weve come to the conclusion we could be at higher rush of getting cancer. 2. My family is literally falling apart around me and Ive left most of the people I know clueless. I live in two different places my friends mostly dont know, parents are divorced again friends dont know, my mum quote literally has a boyfriend and two children daughters slightly older than my sister whos 18. My sister wont make any efforts to get to know these people so Im on my own again trying to make myself likeable for a family I dont even care about. 4. Exams, too many exams that I have 0 confidence in as Im definitely not an academic weapon and executive dysfunction is my worst enemy at the moment. 5. Intrusive thoughts that are so bad. Every 5 minutes my brain is telling me stuff that just isnt true of telling me If I dont do a certain action e.g. tap a pen 3 times Im going to fail these exams. 5. I cant end it because Id make people sad I wish it didnt though and also I dont want to traumatise my parents because theyve been through enough.

I was diagnosed with a disease called Ulcerative Colitis two years ago and was on medication for it to manage the flare ups for roughly a year and a half. It got so bad that I was just passing blood every time I went to the toilet, I was severely anaemic and still going to the gym throught it all. I was called in to the hospital for a blood test, then the day after they said I would have to come in for a 5 day course of IV corticosteroids to try and get it under control. So I went in, was admitted to the emergency ward. I was severely dehydrated and in so much pain at this point. I was meant to be in for 5 days, but the steroids didnt work. They tried every other drug they could to try and help me but none worked. I was moved from ward to ward and despite my amazing team of gastroentologists and doctors they still couldnt help. Eventually they told me they would have to operate on me to remove my colon in order to stop me from dying. I obviously didnt want to, as it would mean I would have an ileostomy bag which was a big issue for me. However, I had no choice so I had the operation. The first 5 days after the operation went okay, I was in a lot of pain but not unbearable as it was managed by oral morphine and IV paracetamol. The operation was laparascopic, which meant small incisions less pain. 5 days after my first operation I was in extreme pain. It started around 8pm and got worse up until 1am, they gave me every drug they could IV paracetamol, IV morphine, Oral Morphine, Ketamine, Fentanyl but nothing would touch the pain. It got so bad I was begging the nurses to kill me or put me under to stop the pain. They took me for a CT scan of my abdomen, and it felt like when I was being taken down there lying on a hospital bed every bump was a knife in my abdomen and I thought I was going to die. They discovered I had a massive build up of fluid and gas in my intestines, and took me down for an emergency operation at 2am, after I had been in unbearable pain for 6 hours. I woke up in the ICU hooked up to 5 different fluids and a morphine PCA. I was told I had suffered from a twisted bowel, which had constricted my stoma and killed a small portion of my small bowel. I was in the ICU for 7 days and they were horrendous, I had a NG tube down my nose, a Robinsons Drain in my side and a new scar down my abs. They had not done laparscopic surgery this time as they didnt have time to, and had cut me open to find the problem. As a result of them poking around in my intestines, my stomach had shut down and I had to have it aspirated by the NG tube every 4 hours, and wasnt allowed to eat or drink anything. Eventually I got out of there and was moves to another ward for a couple weeks before I was discharged. I am getting healthier now, adjusting to my stoma bags. But whenever I hear anything to do with ICU, or hospitals or drugs or painkillers or anything at all that reminds me, it all comes back. Its like Im right back there again, all the fear and pain and confusion is overwhelming and I cant do anything. I have day dreams about it and nightmares I wake up in a cold sweat. The worst part is I dont feel like I have the right to have PTSD, like there are combat vets who have seen the worst a person can see and I have just laid in a hospital for 6 weeks.

He faced no consequences as he was a master manipulator and people like him for being the high school Jock. He always said sorry then repeated the behaviour and laughed with his buddies about it. He even made fun of my heritage where my parents are from in Africa. I get an apology about two years after high school and it in my opinion looked like an apology for himself.

I was scared that i would never stop thinking about it and that it would always be there following me. It got worse and worse, to the point where i broke down crying in my bathroom at 3 am at night one day. Then it got better and was gone for a while, but a week ago it came back out of the blue and i have this feeling of fear and dread in my chest that just wont go away. I think that its not really about the video anymore, i think i got over that, i dont know exactly what it is, maybe the fear of this feeling never going away and me never going to live normally again.

        "input": "Being friends with the person who traumatized you Hey folks. Warning for potential violence and potential murder, its not quite abuse so Im not adding that tag. The experiences that gave me PTSD were caused by one of my best friends who had PTSD themself, we lived together and due to certain circumstances I will not be discussing here, they were being triggered nearconstantly. Their flashbacks were so bad that they would regularly forget who I was and would respond to certain situations violently, or sometimes they would get quiet and I would learn later that they were struggling not to attack me. I lived with them for about a month, and throughout that time I was never hurt, mostly through luck, coincidence, and a locked door. That being said, its been two years since I left. Unkind words were given on their part, I think because I was a constant in their life up until that point. But a few months ago, they reached out to me because of a personal situation that I couldve had a stake in I didnt and we wound up talking about everything that happened. They were generally apologetic, and somehow we wound up saying that we would give friendship another try. We mostly just play games together once a week, and discuss those games. Weve strayed into serious conversations a few times, but Ive put my foot down once or twice when we got too personal because we arent close like that anymore. The thing is, though, Ive been wondering lately whether talking again is even healthy? Its complicated for me, because they used to be the person I looked up to the most, my best friend, the person I told everything to. Now I dont even tell them what I do for work and whether or not Im in school. We just dance around everything that happened like it was an awkward moment for both of us. I enjoy talking to this person, I really do, but I dont know if its going to hinder my recovery or not. My flashbacks were less frequent at first, and then they went back to their prereconciliation levels. Theyre not as upsetting anymore, but the distress has been replaced with confusion and frustration. My mood has also been more stable Im also bipolar. I dont think that they handled the situation well, really, but I also think that its been two years and they know better now. Not perfectly well, but better. And Im not going to ever see them in person again, I dont think, so theyre never going to be in a position again where they could reasonably hurt me. So, my question is, can this be healthy, considering all of the checks Ive put on the relationship? Everyone around me is telling me that Im making a mistake, but I care a lot about this person. A lot. They got me through some tough times, and I got them through some as well. I just dont know anymore. In any manner, thank you for reading. It means a lot.

        "input": "I want to curl up in a ball and die even though all I want to do is live I want to curl up in a ball and die even though all I want to do is live, more than anymore in my life. Im facing a severe depressive episode. I moved from my original home in Saudi Arabia as a young woman for college and moved to Canada. I grew up in a traditional Pakistani household. In no means was I ever meant to be the way I was raised. I developed a deep interest in looking beyond what I was taught, I became to my family, a very disturbed teenager to then just sucking up and being myself when I was alone but having a whole facade of what my family wanted out of me on the outside. The only reason being it was the only way I was able to leave the country and be my own. I am grateful I had a roof over my head, never had to worry about my food, and my dad works his ass off to provide for us as there was no life to live in my home country especially for our family. Despite having financial support in my life my father continues to pay for my housing and tuition to continue to live here, everything else was never great. I faced physical, mental, emotional, verbal and sexual abuse at the hands of my family. They provided me with all the things I wanted, but not the secure love, but they were trying. They still try. But they also try to rid me of everything I am. Shame. Thats the unfortunate feeling I walked away with. A ridiculous amount of guilt and shame. I was not allowed to be outside alone, never allowed to see friends or hang out with me until I was around 17, never allowed to be my own. I succumbed, cause I feel like I have a privilege no one else in my life has had. All of this, but I struggled with my mental health my whole life. Ever since I was a kid. The abuse made it worse or caused it, I cant remember, I just remember feeling sad and then getting beat or verbally told off and just wanting to dissappear. Somehow, I still managed, despite very private severe depressive episode and suicide attemptsself harm. I remember one day my mom saw my wrist, found out, she was very angry with me. She would later remind me of it in future sessions of outbursts when she would get upset at me for just about anything. I will always remember her telling me she wished I had cut deeper. I know she didnt mean it, she has been through a lot, and there was always an undertone of almost a mutual understanding, looking back on it. Not necessarily her being kind and understanding, but I see in her eyes a young girl suffering like I do. I was also struggling with severe physical health problems. I would try to tell my family, they wouldnt listen. These health issues have been reoccurring in my life ever since, though I dont let it get as bad as I was before. I remember getting blood work done and my hemoglobin was at a 3.7 I dont know the units but according to them it was supposed to be at a 9. The doctor was taken aback and had asked me how I was managing on a day to day doing school and everything. I dont know. I dont remember much. It was all a blur of late night breakdowns and struggling to sleep for days on end. Fast forward to now. I moved away to Canada, and my first year here started off in a positive outlook. Then I had a depressive episode again, then I picked it up and decided to completely change my life. I started doing MMA something I was always passionate about twice a day, training, cooking, pursuing my degree and doing well at it, and also maintaining all my hobbies. I also had a knack for organisation, keeping my house in tip top shape. I was living in dorms at the time. I had a roommate and she definitely noticed my depressive episodes, too. She was kind, but I was uncomfortable living with a stranger. I couldnt handle it. It pushed me to stay in my room more and later down the line, I would move away from campus with the support of my family as I told them how tough it was for me to have to live with someone. I feel like a brat. Then, it came again. I got hit with a depressive episode because I started to learn so much about mental health, as I was also going to counseling and seeing a physician for my depression. I got diagnosed with very severe ADHD and they believe I have some sort of clinical depression, anxiety, as well as something OCD related and they also think I might be on the spectrum. I was not shocked, I always knew there was something wrong with me. I started medication for mental illness and that is definitely a whole story on its own. I would take my medication on and off at the time. The memories I had pushed away, current events that were occurring in my life struggling with a semiabusive relationship, all the normal young adult stuff probably all of it just hit me. The final straw, my physical health went backwards again. I was still energetic though, but I had stopped going to MMA, I was hiking a lot, too. Canada is a beautiful country. Then I couldnt anymore. I got too physically and mentally weak. I continued to get help for both medically and on and off counseling I was struggling to make it to appointments. Throughout this, it was well past my first semester in university. I was failing. Badly. I have continued to fail, to this very point. My transcript is all withdrawals with an acceptable grade here and there. I couldnt tell my parents, I still cant. My father paid for those courses. All that money, I wasted. I didnt also have a choice as I am legally obligated to be in school to abide by my study permit, and it was my only way to stay in this country. I couldnt do anything else because my family made it very straight to the point that if I dont do this then I must return home and just live with them until I get married. They wanted me to be a doctor, and though I loved Biology, during this time I learned I didnt want to be a doctor or any of that, and I did love Biology but I loved the evolution side of it more. I learned I loved ancient history, and I switched over to anthropology. I fell in love. Its my passion alongside history in general. I couldnt tell my family about my degree. They would hate me. They would think Im failure. So I have to lie about everything. Lie that Im doing great, that Im going to be a doctor, that Im in university, that Im going to be exactly what they want. If I dont, they will stop funding me. I have no other choice, I never had a choice to be financially independent, I lived in a country as not only a woman but a female immigrant so no one wants that in Saudi Arabia. I have a disdain to it anyway. It is filled with racism, sexism, and homophobia Im definitely not a straight woman, either. This started two years ago. Im here today, still alive. And this depressive episode only spiraled. My home is all just rotting garbage that I dont have the energy to take out, but Ive been actually trying. Ive been trying and failing but still kicking but the weight of everything and just having depression has left me in rock bottom. I feel like a piece of shit disappointment spoiled bratty privileged daughter, I even dug my savings and constantly need to ask my family for money as I have no energy to make my own meals. Nor do I have the means to as my fridge makes me gag everytime I open it, my sink is full of rotting dishes, pots, pans, etc. So I order food. I cant do anything, but I have been trying little by little to see hope, yet I still breakdown and want to die in a time where Im fighting so hard to live. I have also reapplied to extend my status here as a student, and considering the current political situation and understandably, an unconvincing transcript, Im probably going to get deported or something. I dont feel like I even deserve to be here, I am in a privileged place and I have not done anything worthwhile out of it. Someone else who deserves to be here cant, while I can. I hate myself and everything I am. I try to do things little by little as my counselor suggests, but it doesnt feel like the dawn of a new day. I feel absolutely disgusted by myself. I want to just curl up and die, but I so badly wish I could just live and live to help others. I want to be a voice of reason for many. I want to do so much, but those are just dreams. Im afraid Im going to lose my hard battle with depression. I dont even take any measures to hurt myself in any way. I think Im just going to waste away until I become a shell of my former self. Then I wont be me anymore and rot away and die or do something to end it.",

At first, the symptoms that appeared to me were a headache and I started seeing blue and green colors and my heart started beating rapidly. The symptoms lasted for two hours and I did not ejaculate. At that moment, I had a scary feeling. I felt that the left side of my body started to tingle or feel like chills and I felt that my soul was coming out of my body. I do not know if this was a case of fainting or death or high blood pressure. I went to the hospital immediately. They measured my heart. I had palpitations and my blood pressure was high and they gave me heart palpitations pills. When I took them, I felt better, but the next day the heart palpitations returned and I became more anxious and afraid for no reason, especially when I went to sleep. I went to the cardiologist and he put a holter device on my body for a whole day and took a blood test and my vitamin D level was 8. I do not know if this was the reason. After that, the holter device was checked. My pulse was 164 beats when exerted and 43 beats when relaxed. Then he gave me pills. For the heart, including vitamin D 50,000, I started taking pills and the situation was getting worse. The anxiety and fear increased for no reason, as well as depression, and I had a feeling that I was dying. I was crushed from the inside, and the thinking, fear, and obsessions increased. Then I stopped the medications that the doctor gave me, called ivadin, except for vitamin D 50,000. I am still taking vitamin D. It has been 3 weeks since I took vitamin D weekly. During those days, I feel dizzy immediately after eating, and when I go to sleep, my heart rate slows to 55, and I have shortness of breath and a feeling of fainting. Today, I took magnesium pills from the pharmacy, as they are beneficial with vitamin D. This is my condition. Can you help?",

Let me give some context I have always had anxiety over walmart ever since I was a little kid. When I was about 6, my grandma made my older cousin and I go to the back to get something, as we were walking, a man flew around one of those shorter square shelfs, and hit me with his buggy so hard that the corner of the shelf stabbed into my side, he ran away and didnt apologize as I was gushing blood out of my hip. I still have a scar from it. So now Im 25 I still unfortunately have to go to the same exact walmart and I feel like its only worse... We live in a city of 35,000 people Walmart is the most affordable grocery store in town besides HEB, I live in Texas, but HEB is in an even SMALLER building than walmart, and twice as packed because of the good deals this walmart not only has our whole towns population at times, it has everyone who is traveling the major state highway that is right in front of it, and people who are from smaller towns like 20 mins away. we live in a retirement city, there are alot of older people on electric scooters and alot of families who come in together and it makes it really hard to get around. everything is always out of stock and I feel like the grocery pickup has alot to do with it and also contributes to the crowds when they push around their ginormous carts When I turned 18 before pandemic times, I had no problem with shopping in the middle of the night because at least thats an option for people who dont like crowds. Now that walmart isnt 24 hours anymore, my best bet is going at 6am, which isnt possible anymore because my boyfriend and I are sharing a car and he gets off at prime time, 530 pm and unfortunately, he hates it as much as I do, so we end up sprinting out of there with barely anything. We have used the grocery pick up before, but its really frustrating when we plan out a meal and its out of stock and they replace it with something that doesnt work for our recipe, or they just entirely mess up or order, causing us to have to go inside to fix it. Im not delusional when I say they are so busy, Ive looked up reviews for our walmart and others say its so crowded or the layout is bad. Please any advice that can help me get through this. A walmart shouldnt be making me want to pack everything and leave this town because its my only option to shop at, but it is because its affecting my everyday life and Im tired of being hungry because I dont have the strength to push through in there. It feels like someone is constantly on top of me or in the way or about to hit me. Please help",

I sent a voice message to 3 of my friends saying things like I just grab her ass and she doesnt want it... whore... what the fuck. I dont mention any names in it either, my friends thought it was funny at first and thought I was taking the piss. I listened to it again a few weeks later and asked my friends to delete the voicemail, which they did. My Friends confirmed that I did Not harass anybody that evening and everything is Fine. Im still incredibly scared that it will be leaked somewhere and Ill be accused of rapesexual harassment and my career will be ruined. Im completely desperate. This feeling of completely losing control about my conciousness without taking any drugsalcohol drives me Crazy. Even in my everyday life I often think I Said things I did. Not say and believe things I did. Not do.",

I just feel so awful and lost rn I really need some support and kindness right now and I cant seem to explain what I need from to loved ones. Im also feeling like Im overreacting to what happened to me 24 hours ago. Im 99.99 sure these two events are unrelated but god does it sucks. To cut a long story short one of my patients old man, but strong as hell at work punched me in the face so hard I fell. Other than a busted lip, some aches from points of impact from fist and the floor, I am physically ok. I couldve seriously been hurt but luckily I wasnt wearing my glasses, and I was able to fall safely I go home early and can only manage 4 hours of sleep. I then have to drive a family friend in my car for an hour. Which is really hard for me because I have severe trauma from being abused by my ex and grandfather inside a car. People in my car is a huge trigger. Right before I drive this person though, my ex texts me something weird. Ive told my ex to NEVER contact me unless it was a family emergency of some type and I thought he understood this because I hadnt heard from him in months. Anyways. Its a screenshot of a tweet, obviously just like some harmless little meme and I wouldve excused it as maybe an accidental message not meant for me until I read what it said. It said murmuring ok slay as someone shows me how to use a can opener For context, 8 years ago when I was 16 and dating him we dated for 7 years, starting when I was 16 we were making dinner at my house. I had happened to have just never used a can opener before weird, I know, but I was 16 and I didnt really like canned foods so I never had to use one. So I turn to him and I ask, oh hey can you show me how to use this? But for some reason this ANGERS him. He shuts down on me, tell me to just look it up in a mean tone and hes like you seriously dont know how to use a can opener and all around, it was just a cruel experience. He never did show me and he ended up ignoring me from how angry and stupid he thought I was Anyways. That was not an ok slay moment for me. I just have. No. Idea. WHY. He would send me a joke like that? Im so confused? Like Im just so hurt right now. And I mightve brushed it off but like. I was violently attacked not even 12 hours prior to him texting me that out of the blue. And Im just feeling so down on myself. I feel like Im overreacting to everything thats happened in the past 24 hours. Like Im just being over dramatic and I should get over this but god it is so hard right now. My feelings hurt. My face hurts. I just want support and kind words right now and I feel like such crap for trying to ask my loved ones hey can you be extra nice to me right now? I was assaulted and then my ex texted me. I already told them all these details and like, they were pretty nice to me but idk it didnt feel like enough? I dont want to sound like a weird bitch by specifically asking them to be extra comforting to me. Or maybe they just dont really know what else to say to me. But I feel awful for venting and feel awful for feeling like I want to be a little, idk, doted on? Is that so wrong? I dont know if thats wrong of me to feel or not.

        "input": "Just got a completely random PTSD diagnosis, dont really know what happens next. Hi, Ive never been here before, but I suppose its the proper place on the internet to post. Posting on alt account for privacy. This became a little long, Im sorry Ive went through a pretty extensive psychological examination the last few months, with the initial goal just to go through ADHD, but weve went through a ton. I never thought I had PTSD or something like that, I never experienced flashbacks, any super triggering moments that that made me angry or something else, never happened. Im also like the least agressive teddy bear there exists I think. Never really crossed my mind. But I did relate to a lot of things on the, whatever the English word, the tests you fill in, around Trauma and PTSD. But afterwards it sort of felt like an insult to people with actual PTSD, that I had any thoughts surrounding that. We had gone over things like my SA as a boy, abusive households, suicidality, amongst some other things that felt like they might be relevant in evaluating my mental health. The psychologist I talked to was absolutely amazing. I told him about one thing that I didnt have an answer to, where most of my inner self, I feel I am relatively aware of, but this was one thing I didnt understand, and never had. Ive had a bad feeling, as Ive started to call it, in giving up for searching for words like anxiety, or whatever this bad feeling, could be, since Ive been around 1112, Im 25 now. This feeling is constant, Im having it writing this, and everything I do, since then, aside from when Im using drugs like benzos, or had in the past. Zopiclone managed to do that for me too somehow. It was the only time, quite literally ever, where I felt at peace, I could relax, enjoy a movie, or have a meal. Alcohol abuse was a thing too, but was far far less effective for the bad feeling. It worked decently well for social anxiety though. It felt far fetched that I had something like anxiety literally 247, regardless of situation. Whether Im in love with a girl Im dating with all the positive hormones through the roof, or going through something tough, the feeling always, always remains. Ive heard of anxiety to describe moments, of anxiety, that it wasnt constant. Still dont know if it is anxiety. Its not like I think of something and it gives me this bad feeling, it just always is there, where ever I go, it follows. Paranoia, and feeling like everything is going to go to hell, regardless of what it is, or how trivial. I seem to be physically unable to sleep like a normal human being, unless Im on large dosages of medication. First time I ever slept since I was a child, like actually slept, was just an encounter with good, heavy sleep meds, which was relatively recent. Zopiclone only worked for a high. So Im not on extreme insomnia at the very moment. Used to have constant nightmares, not as much anymore, but they come, and its often repeated nightmares. Terrible confidence in every aspect. The outside can tell me that Im attractive or that Im smart, it all goes away though. Everyone has an ulterior motive in my mind, they must not mean it. Im in this weird zone where I both need validation for those types of things, and also get very little out of the validation. Feel like everyone is just out to get me, sort of thing, even when I can recognize myself that its completely irrational. And the world is not a safe space to be in. Super low baseline mood, never really happy, I have periods of full blown depressions once in a while. Its hard for me to find things fun or enjoyable. I isolate myself completely, I dissociate from reality quite a bit. I dont know, we went over a lot of my life. I dont know how much of it is related to a PTSD diagnosis, or something else entirely, but its there. Most of these did not exist before 1112 yo, but essentially all of it came after. Although some of it could just be a lot of other aspects. My psychologist made the connection above, that my dumbass hadnt figured out, that the bad feeling, amongst all else, coincidentally came after these childhood events. In a pretty focused time point. So we talked a lot about it. I asked him after all of it, what stood out, he mentioned ADHD and things surrounding trauma. That these things were to persue all the way out. But PTSD, was still not on my mind. I was just like yeah I guess I might have a bit of a trauma issue perhaps. CURRENT TIMES YAY! I go to finish an explanation of the results of a cognitive test Ive made prior, and meet a different psychologist, not the dude I talked with. Turns out I get diagnosed with ADHD, and Im not dumb on paper yay. Months work past me. But, it was also, almost casually explained that I have a formal, real ass PTSD diagnosis. For whatever reason there was some miss match with a follow up for that, I suppose, and I got to hear that secondhand. And she was apologetic I remember. I look up my medical journal, and boom, a big ass, fat PTSD diagnosis up in there. She books me a time with a new psychologist for PTSD, the amazing guy is on family leave, yay. This was a couple days ago, Im now waiting for a follow up. I still dont really know what the actual fuck this means. What the implications are, how this is going to impact my life, if some of these things can get better, what the treatments are, I have no clue. So I guess after the wall of text, my question I suppose is if anyone here at all can relate to any of this, if there are people here not suffering through flashbacks or things of that nature. Maybe someone has something to share And also I suppose Im writing because I cant really tell people in my surroundings about this, so this is what Ive got at the moment. And I suppose Im trying to conquer my undying shame, so saying these things out loud, to people outside of just my psychologists, is news for me. Thank you. And sorry if its too much.

The reasons for not going is Im old, I may not be able to find a job, I am taking the spot a younger person could occupy. I foolishly think I have the ability to do this from a technology standpoint.

I just want to leave this world, I want to die but Im too weak to do that because I dont want my family and friends to suffer because of me, so instead I drink every night and then cut myself to distract myself from the storm in my head.

I saw a comment on rAskReddit the other day about having OCD and ensuring therapists do not validate the anxietiesthoughts from OCD. I was thinking about this and I recall a therapist I had several years ago. I told her that I had some anxiety about eating in a restaurant alone, especially sitting in a booth and seeing the empty chair across from me. She told me that if it were her, she would have booked it out of the restaurant immediately. I think her goal was to validate my feelings about being nervous but reflecting on this, I have not been able to eat alone since then. What she said affirmed in my mind that my anxieties about eating alone were justified. I cant recall too many other examples but Ive seen a couple of other therapists after her and I must have shared similar anxieties about other situations. I dont want this to say I am pointing the blame at these therapists, these anxieties are my own and my own to deal with. But I do wonder if these therapists have worsened these fears? If they were maybe at a 510 on the anxiety scale, talking to these therapists and having these fears justified bumped them to a 710. I apologize for the wall of text. Ive just never been able to really reap benefits from therapy and Im starting to wonder if I need to seek out a therapist specialized in OCD just based off that rAskReddit comment.

The last 2 weekends I took our new to us jeep on the interstate with my husband in the passenger seat. The first time I made it about 20 miles before I pulled off at a rest area to swap with him because my hands were shaking so bad and my heart was racing. This past weekend I managed to make it a lot further on both days, but my hands still shook badly. I offered to drive about 3045 minutes south of us to get meat from the butcher shop we use. Alone. I plan to take the interstate but if its too much for me there are backroads I can use that Im pretty familiar with, but I wont have that safety net of my husband. I just had to take a shower alone. Thats stressful for me. I have PTSD as well as Bipolar 1 and being vulnerable in the shower is scary for me, but I did it. But now its made my nerves very frayed for the driving I have to do in an hour. My husband did take the jeep to work so that I could use the Camry which has more safety features and is easier to drive and has way more power to get up to speed when getting on the interstate. So we have mitigated my fears as best we can. Anyway I just wanted to get this off my chest. My family and friends do not understand what a big deal this is for me, or just how bad my anxiety is. Even my own 29 year old son who just was home in June to help out with a severe episode that had me hospitalized, replied when I told him about my first time driving in years, he says gee mom its almost like you drove for years.

        "input": "When youve hit rock bottom the only way to go is up First off CW for abuse, csa, hoarding, and ideation This is my first time posting something like this on a reddit forum besides maybe some drawings on other forums. Reason why Im here is for support and to connect with others who may have gone through similar. Little bit of background Im 21 and have delt with PTSD for as far back as middle school. I wasnt diagnosed until June of 2021 and have been struggling to figure out what this means for me since said diagnosis. One thing that you should know is Im also AuDHD and have MDD for context. To make things short, I came from a broken home, 3 siblings C is currently 27yro, N is 24yro, Im the 3rd born and my youngest sister Ce is 19yro as of writing single mom who at the time I was born was divorcing my dad. My dad was abusive physically to my mom and had very untreated ADHD, his anger was out of control 99 of the time. I was too young to witness any of it, once I was old enough to remember anything he was already kicked out and out of my life. I was 5 when my moms new boyfriend moved in and later in life at 78 years old he would abuse me sexually, later found out all 4 of us kids were abused by him. He was also just a massive dickhead, who was and I dont like using this word for this a narcissist. He started fights and loved to see and make my oldest sister who was severely autistic, extremely upset. She would get so upset she would get into physical altercations with my mom almost on the daily and threaten her sisters including me that she would murder us in our sleep. We had to lock the knives away in a separate drawer. Needless to say, little me didnt get much sleep at all as a kid. If I wasnt kept up by my sister and step dad having screaming matches, I was up awakened by panick attacks that my sister would one day come and kill us in our sleep. To this day I have insomnia because of high anxiety. My paternal grandma was the only one who really took care of me. My mom wasnt in her right mind at the time of raising me and my grandma noticed at a young age I wasnt held as much as a mother should hold their infant. So my grandma held me many times Ive had autistic meltdowns and my mom would disregard me as being difficult. My family never caught onto the fact I was AuDHD because in comparison to my high needs autistic sister, C, to them I was as neurotypical as they get. So I never got accommodations for my AuDHD. The problem is my Grandma never really did anything to help with Cs anger against my mom and step dad which would only end up in more arguments. My grandma meant a lot to me but by age 13 my mom had stopped taking us to our grandmas since she thought my grandma was only making things worse and to an extent, she was. Leaving the only person who ever treated me with kindness dispite my AuDHD was only further destruction to my development hence the PTSD diagnosis. January 11th 2019 was the day my stepdad got outted for sexually abusing all of us kids. My sister, N, came into my room crying because my oldest sister C had told her that my step dad had groped her the other night. I had to call my mom from work and all I remember was the sound of my mom wailing over the phone begging N to say she was lying. We called the cops. They took my sisters reports. And I stayed silent. I stayed silent because being the trouble child in my family as well as undiagnosed untreated AuDHD it was easy to blame me for a lot of things and dismiss me for my feelings and concerns due to me being unruly. I thought at the time they would dismiss my assault just the same as everything else I had concerns of throughout my life. After that I knew no one was taking the grief well and neither was I. My family was just so angry at eachother blaming everyone for the fights the assaults, who deserved what more, whos fault it was, who caused it. Everyone was pointing fingers all at anyone but the man who assaulted us. I was excluded by my sisters for being papas favorite since to them I was never assaulted. Mom detached from us kids because every one of my sisters were mad at her for bringing her boyfriend into our lives only to traumatize us. Everyone blamed eachother for grieving. Everyone blamed eachother for not listening to what the other has to say. No one was getting anywhere. I had known my mind was fucked up beyond imagination so I sought a counselor through my school who then refered me to a therapist office that provided my school services since my highschool was in a low income area of Seattle that had students who have been brought up in bad homes. I started therapy sophomore year of highschool and was diagnosed with Post traumatic stress at 17. I graduated during the pandemic, moved to Ellensburg WA to attend CWU for only 6 months before realizing I didnt have the funds to complete college. Then moved back home March of 2022 It was the hardest decision Ive ever made. As I had promised myself I would never come back to my moms house after graduating. I got a summer job that paid well then worked as a receptionist at a clinic in Seattle in September 2022. Come October I would meet my first boyfriend...now ex. My relationship with my bf well call him Jackie was a breathe of fresh air. He lived in Bellevue and we hit it off pretty well through bumble. He lived with his parents since he was attending college and working and didnt make enough to move out and wasnt in school enough classes to move into dorms. He came from a pretty privileged background his dad a white collar worker, a boss of a boss for a tech company in Seattle. His mom, too disabled to work and had to retire early. He had one sibling, older than him that was moved out and attending school. Everyday was bliss. It went from getting yelled at by some patients family at work then going home to a house of family members who hated eachothers guts. I lived with my little sister in a small room and being both adults wasnt ideal at all, we would fight over space all the time. But my mom didnt have the money to move us to a larger house where wed have our own space. But on the weekends? The weekends....it was another world. The grass felt greener on the other side. Weekdays was long shifts and a hoarders house of spoiled milk and leftovers piled in a fridge. My mother and sisters fighting at night until Id wake up at 4 in the morning to go back to work but the weekends.... I went to Jackies house. Clean food, clean water, no bug infestations, no fear of spoiled food and botulism, no fear of having to buy take out and sleeping in moldy bed sheets. The weekends. They were what I needed. His parents knew that I was living in a bad home and made it known that I could go to their home at any time to escape for a breather before going back to work and paying off student loans. Come October last year I had to move into his parents due to my school charging me 200 more on my student loans each month. That along with paying moms rent and gas meant I was spending more money than I was making. I got into a huge argument with my mom, I asked her if I could spend less on rent due to an increase in loan payments and she didnt take it well. I took an uber to spend the night at Jackies. I woke up with the idea to move in. The clinic that I worked at had a unit in Bellevue. If I had gone up the ladder from Receptionist to tech Id be making more. But Id be paying just the rent and loans instead of my moms gas, the groceries, utilities ect ect ect. I talked with Jackies parents and they let me stay, knowing I was in a bad home they set a plan for me to move in and work full time so I could pay off my debt. They said no matter what happened to Jackie and I, their house was a safe haven. Jackie broke up with me on the 13th of October this year. 2 days after our 2nd anniversary. Ill save the details because that can be its own post here since it relates heavily to my post traumatic. But when we broke up, I had been kicked out by his parents. The break up wasnt over something bad that he or I did to eachother, we just realized we didnt work out since we were both dealing with stuff. Jackie was trying to deal with trauma they had gone through years ago that they didnt realize had effected them till he started to see it effect our relationship. And I the same. We both agreed to split and go no contact. Our feelings towards eachother indifferent. I had to move back into my moms house. And its been hard doing that while grieving my first relationship and my first LONG TERM relationship. My little sister, Ce, has been there for me but only for a bit until it exhausts her. I get it, my house is a family who hasnt properly grieved their traumas and dont believe in therapy unfortunately. Getting back into this environment is hard. I have to walk on eggshells around my mom and sisters. The food here is spoiled and my mom keeps buying more food that only then becomes spoiled because theres no room in the fridge for it to be put in. Talking about the trash in the house has been hush hush. I get that working with hoarders its very important to not make note of the hoarding and instead approach it from a point of understanding their trauma. But if I actually want to help my mom then it needs to involve an actual therapist to coach the act of removing the hoard. My sister Ce has given up on trying to help my mom since shes tried everything and came to a point here. Youre more likely to get kicked out by mom for mentioning the kitchen than you would catch botulism from 7 day old leftovers. The first week moving back in after breaking up with Jackie, I was incredibly suicidal. I went back to the house I promised I wouldnt come back to. I was kicked out and into the house my exes parents promised they would not send me back to. I didnt have Jackie to text for support whenever the house became too much for me. Never mind Im never welcomed into his home again, be it his parents or his future apartment. I have no one. The only thing thats helped me is a couple of friend of mine Ive reconnected with, listening to music especially Tyler, the creators new album, watching all the shows I used to watch with Jackie as well as the shows I promised him we would watch together. Coming back to a house like this is extremely triggering. And its hard to move out since everything is expensive and Im still in debt so I dont have the credit score to get me a car or an apartment even if I wanted to or could afford it, I wouldnt get it with my score due to being in debt. I dont know how Im going to get out of this all. But I hope to post more on here to connect with people who have post traumatic as I can expect will need a support group now that Im back in a not so great environment. Im trying to find hope everyday and everyday Im finding a little bit of myself again after my break up. I still have my job, Im so grateful for that and my boss for transferring me to a unit thats closest to my moms place so I dont have to lose my job. I lost a home that accommodated my needs, a family who listened and understood me, a boyfriend who gave me the love I told myself I never deserved. Im not about to lose my job. Theres hope. Im not about to let all this get in the way of me getting out. Promise, Im gon make it out.",

I also seen two physiatrist who only do med management and both want me on meds. I dont have constant anxiety I can go 67 months without ever having a panick attack but when I get overwhelmed and stress I have one really bad month where I get panick attacks frequently and then it starts to die down about 3 weeks for having the attacks. I stopped my old meds per the psychiatrist request because they were prescribed by my pcp, they were antidepressants and I have no signs of depression. And Ive been off meds for two weeks and I feel better and havent had any anxiety in 3 weeks. So do I really need to be on meds daily if they doesnt happen daily. The second psychiatrist who I preferred over the first had better knowledge and understanding even though she only does med management. I asked her will I need to be on meds forever she said no we need to treat it now and once we know the meds work we can go to an as needed basis but if I start meds now when Im not having anxiety or panic attacks how will I know its working.

Getting though the day and the tasks required of me is extremely difficult. Most of the features of 1 are also present. These first two are largely subtractive. Its like pieces of me are missing. The third is different 3. This is far more extreme than the others. It comes with a burning pain unlike anything else. It in no way resembles sadness. Similar to a toothache, I cannot think about anything else. My mind is full of repetitive dark phrases and Im just waiting out the clock to run out. Its hard to be still. Thankfully it doesnt happen very often. These states come over me without reason. It is unlike anxiety which usually has triggers. I try to think of them as you would when you are sick with a virus.

My sleep problems started last week so I ended up starting my antipsychotic in the hopes that it would help with my sleep issues. Didnt really help so went to see my doctor and she recommended a sleep aid. I dont mind taking it, but after reading the pamphlet it says for short term use and it runs the risk of the dependency. Should I be worried? I always over analyze any medication I take and worry about the long term effects. I am bipolar type 1 and had my last manic episode in June that landed me in a 2 week hospitalization. Just wondering if anyone else takes something similar and what experience they had had on them? My last antipsychotic helped a ton with my sleep problems, but it caused massive weight gain which was the reason I switched medication to a weight neutral med according to my psychiatrist.

Context I live in Argentina. In my city the temp amplitude during the whole year goes from about 1 degree celsius on the coldest days of winter to around 42 degrees on the hottest days of summer. In 2018 I moved to Mexico and lived there for two and a half years. The annual temp amplitude in Mex goes from about 6 degrees celsius to around 27 degrees. After I came back to Argentina, which was during the COVID19 lockdown, I noticed myself longing to go back because I remember my time in Mexico as a time in which I was generally more stable. Of course my mood would go up and down depending on what was happening in my life, but I remember I was a happier person in general. My low moods werent as low and my high moods werent as high. I was genuinely happy but I never felt it was due to mania, it never got dangerous. It was also much easier for me to take better care of myself I showered more often, I worked out, I ate healthy food. Here in Argentina I cant really make myself do those things even if Im currently on meds that are better for me than the ones I used to take when I was in Mexico. I used to have more energy, I did more things that made me happy everyday, I took better care of my dogs, I was way more productive and actually enjoyed my life beyond my 95. I went out with friends, I streamed games online almost every day, I went out shopping or to eat, I was a really active person. I dont feel like the lockdown had anything to do with my lower mood, since after it was over I was still unable to go back to the happy person I was before, even considering Im now in my home country which means I have more friends, I know the city, Im close to my family, its easier to make new friends, its easier to find jobs, etc. Of course being the BIG DEAL that it is living in a foreign country, there are many other factors that might have played into this, but I really think this temperature thing had a lot to do with it.

Some days, I feel like a total imposter, like maybe I wasnt even bad enough for this diagnosis and meds. Im so tempted to just go off them and see if Ill feel any better. Honestly, Im scared Ill lose my spark and that Ill never feel like me again. I cant imagine a life worth living if Im going to feel numb like this forever, and it makes me worried about my future. Does it ever get better? Any advice or hope would mean a lot because right now, Im just so lost. Thanks for reading!",

The same night i noticed i was showing signs of when Im manic but i wasnt sure if its possible to change in a matter of hours. I literally trashed my room that same night, then the next day i was nonverbal and didnt want to talk to anybody because i knew id blow up that quick. Then since then its like every day i flip flop between outgoing, productive, happy, spending money, and outside with anybody thats willing TO calm, less productive, paranoid, and spending time with only family TO cant get out of bed, cant even do school work, isolating, and crying when im not even sad about anything.

I feel like he ripped away my chance at freedom from my life of neglect, I got pregnant at 20. I was a virgin, never had a relationship before that. I understand that I was an adult, but I am neurodivergent and I cant help but feel like he somehow still groomed me. Used me. Manipulated me for three years before I finally called it quits. There is so much more about him that I could type out but I just dont have the energy. Ive been depressed and suicidal as long as I can remember. Unloved and neglected by my family. Unhealthy, obese starting from a toddler because my parents didnt give enough of a shit to try to change it. My sister tormented me until she moved away when I was 13, but the damage she did had already left many scars on my brain. And it still has. Sure I am kind and loving, more intelligent and open minded than most people nowadays. But what is any of that worth if I feel so constantly alone and invisible? I cant leave my daughter in this world by herself, but sometimes that just makes me feel like shes an anchor. I could never leave her to suffer the mental manipulation her father is capable of. I couldnt. I love her so much but I am finding myself wishing more and more that I had never met her father. None of it is her fault either, she is a beautiful and happy, very intelligent little girl. Im so pathetic. I try, I try so fucking hard to keep myself motivated, I quit everything I could think of that would affect my brain negatively. Weed, nicotine, sugar, caffeine, alcohol, and other occasional substances. Maybe its just withdrawal symptoms but maybe not, because Im no stranger to these thoughts. I am so bored with life. Im so exhausted from just waking up in the morning, from having to move to appease my basic bodily needs. I wish something would end my life so that I dont have to. I wont, I never will. But this life is looking like a long, torturously unhappy life and Im just left wondering why? Why me? Why couldnt I have been someone born to a stable home, where I had a place to grow up and have roots? Instead I have had to move nearly every 18 months growing up, like clockwork. And since I have had my child, I havent stayed in one place longer than 68 months. I cant even afford childcare to work fulltime. Dont even get me started on the actual idiocy of that vicious loop, not being able to work because I dont have childcare, not being able to afford it because I cant work for the money.

A few days after I got out of the hospital, I went back to work, but they fired me. My health kept getting worse until May stomach and digestive issues, and I wasnt able to work.

My mom is the most important person to me, and the reason Im around. She has cancer, had a masectomy within 3 weeks of finding it, and now is refusing chemo bc shes older and doesnt want to spend the rest of her life sick she is 62 this gives the cancer a 13 chance to come back in 5 years.

Got SAd at ages 4 and 16, but I dont even know if they count as SA since no PIV happened fingers. At 13 I attempted, but my mom got home earlier than usual so I panicked and spit the meds out. She doesnt know to this day. I thought I could move on from these, but here comes the part that destroys me the most. Ive been chronically ill most of my life. Started out at 8 years old with Hashimotos autoimmune thyroid. I thought it should be fine, everything hurts and Im exhausted all the time but its the weaker one of the autoimmune diseases, right? It keeps going. Last 2 years are hell on earth, I keep losing balance, limbs randomly stop working, I feel like Im being crushed to death. But I push through, have to finish that Bachelors! I did it, but then the diagnosis came after I nearly went blind in one eye. Multiple Sclerosis. Not even 2 months later, now, I get a message from my specialist about the ANA testing we did a while ago for the insurance company. She tells me that I have to see a rheumatologist as I have every single antibody for Lupus. I cant do this anymore, I cant keep it together. I have a few good friends and an amazing boyfriend, despite being together only 6 months and him seeing all this shit, he still wants to stay. But what if I destroy him and his future? I wanted kids so fucking bad but with all these it would clearly be selfish, I dont want to pass on my horrible genes filled with diseases. Ive been unemployed for almost 4 months now so Im useless, in my country mental health is not a thing so I cant seek out any help. But not like I have money for it.

Pressured speech and impulsiveness, your full of ideas moving on from one to another in seconds your mind goes faster then your body you can go on without rest for days and then fall asleep for a couple of minutes thinking it was hours completely losing track of time I felt unbreakable, but I already knew that there would be a price to pay. The people around you are terrified that your next angry outburst might be right around the corner a bomb that could go off at any second. You assure strangers of your love for their imperfections yet you ignore the people whom are closest and really care about you. You get angry over small things and just keep pushing others away because its a fun game too see how far you can bend them until the break Lets lose control, I dont care if youre hurt or what happens to me. Im the king of the world I need no one Distraction, youd do things you normally wouldnt do everythings clearer, you lose a dollar you gain a dollar you travel the country on credit cards. Its all about pleasure, drugs, dance, jokes, spending money, its aggression its alcohol its sex with strangers and you fall in love with one look, one sentence. You spin fast and faster and faster and faster and suddenly someone turns the lights off Can you imagine what its like to lose interest in everything you ever wanted to do, everything you ever wanted to be? You hit rock bottom where the waters are pitch black you didnt sleep for a week and now you sleep all day. Your friends, your job, your savings, your motivation, your focus they all keep disappearing one by one as though someone is crossing them off the list, until there is nothing left nothing apart from selfhate low self esteem and all that guilt and shame for what you did when you were high on mania.

And is this just mania, or am I just actually truly happy? The thing that scares me the most is that one of those days Ill finally find the courage to end it, Im stuck in the middle im still depressed but with the mania energy to fulfill my death wish. But I fight back I .. I fight back with my vices, which I truly love and hate at the same time but even though it hurts sometimes, and I know drugs wont help me feel at all you know Id rather have a one dimensional life with sparks of happiness and no real highs then no life at all And I I just, know i know my depression would have claimed my existence a long long time ago if I didnt try to control it.

Despite that I managed over a decade of youth work, Im ferocious about the protection of others. I came unstuck when I asked for help for the first time in my life about 6 years ago. I wasnt helped. I was blamed, shunned, judged and revictimised and I fought back with everything I had because its always been in my nature to do so. I have the same ferocity for myself. Ive proven that, I just find another gear and run on pure adrenaline until the danger is past and I can recover in private... till the next round. I recently 3ish months ago got sober after becoming unstuck from the lack of support I had 6 years ago. Obviously substances made things worse and Ive taken full responsibility for the hurt Ive caused other people because of that. Im still proccessing alot of horrific things that happened a year ago in therapy and Im oscillating from rage to numbness constantly. I was starting to feel some stirrings of sadness about the whole situation when a man put his hands on me completely unprovoked in a inappropriate way not SA at the end of last week. Because of that it launched me into a fight type ptsd response. The kind where your so enraged you could kill someone and I stress I wouldnt they are thoughts. Im a woman and Im feeling very unfeminine about having such violent reaction. I asked my therapist about if its usually a male thing and they said usually. I think Im feeling some shame about having had to become my own protector, others protector and I cant function normally anymore. I cant even hide the rage I used to be able to hide anger... this is different. It shows on my face and in my body language and I know it can scare some people because they dont know whats about to happen or if Ill lash out. It provokes anxiety and fear in other people and I never used to be like this. Alot more awful things happened to me in those 6 years and Im... different again with the ptsd I have. Its like my nervous system and brain got rewired to fight mode when I was attempting to put the pieces of my life back together. The worst thing Ive done when Im like this is break inanimate objects, throw things,, swear and slam doors. When Ive calmed down enough I always apologise and mean it. I think its because I no longer want to die so taking it all out on myself like I used to has caused the symptoms to flip into outward physical symptoms.

I try to keep pushing forward, but the weight of it all is suffocating, and it never ends. Its like a neverending cycle of exhaustion and emotional pain that I cant escape from. Every time I think Im out of it, it pulls me right back in. I keep telling myself to keep fighting, but its getting harder to see the point. And whats worse is that no one around me understands. My mom, my best friend, they dont see it, or they dont get it. No one sees the real me, and it just makes everything feel more isolating. Its like Im invisible, like I dont matter, even though Im dying inside. Every time I try to talk, it feels like Im talking to a wall, and it just gets worse. I keep waiting for someone to see me, to understand me, but all I get is silence. And honestly, I feel like maybe its me, maybe Im the one whos the problem, but I cant seem to get out of this dark place. It feels like Im trapped in my own mind, and its killing me. And on top of all that, Ive had to deal with a narcissistic ex who left me with trauma, and my mom, whos been equally selfish and dismissive, emotionally unavailable. Ive been to a psychiatrist, but it doesnt feel like anyone really gets me. I feel like Ive tried everything, but no matter how hard I try, I cant shake this feeling of being misunderstood and alone. When I went to the psychiatrist, I opened up about my trauma, about being manipulatively sexualized, about what I went through, but he didnt even acknowledge it. He didnt say a word about it, and I dont understand why. Its like my pain didnt matter. I felt so dismissed, like nothing I said mattered. I just dont know why it felt so... empty.

Id really appreciate any advice on managing this situation, especially if anyones done a sudden stop with benzos. My Plan for the Next Few Days Ive done some quick research and put together a plan to help manage the symptoms. Im trying to keep things simple and manageable. Heres what Im doing Basic Supplements Vitamin B Complex in the morning to support the nervous system. Vitamin C in the morning helps with stress. Magnesium in the evening to help with sleep. Ashwagandha KSM66 Morning dose with breakfast for anxiety. Optional evening dose to help me wind down at night if I need it. Daily Routine Im trying to stay active with a morning workout or light exercise to keep my mind occupied. At night, Im focusing on relaxation with a bit of meditation and the magnesium. No alcohol, staying hydrated, and keeping meals simple. I know this isnt a magic fix, but Im hoping these small steps will keep me grounded.

I have only been getting these hallucinations as a symptom for about a year, I thought they would get better with time but they have only been more vivid and frequent as time passes, I was hoping for advice from someone who has also dealt with this symptom and what can be done to help myself when I start seeing things. Tonight has been the most difficult instance of this I have ever had, I came home from work and immediately thought I saw someone in my house and I tried my best to brush it off as usual, however I couldnt shake the image I had seen and was very on edge. About an hour after this my wife asked if we could change our bedroom to another room and I said yes. We started pulling out the contents of the new bedroom so we could start putting our bed and other furniture in it. The the stuff we moved out of the room was put in the hallway we live in a trailer and there is only one hallway I came to a scary realization that if someone broke in I would not be able to quickly get to the other end of my house where I store my gun to protect my wife and I. I then thought I saw something move at the end of the hallway on that end of the house. I immediately started panicking and felt trapped which turned into a huge episode, it took my wife almost an hour to calm me down and assure me there was no one inside other than us... This has only seemed to get worse and not better. I used to only see things through my window or over my shoulder as I walked inside from my car.... Now I see things like this in my house all the time. I feel like a weak basket case that cant protect his own family..... My final question is are these sort of vivid hallucinations common with ptsd?",

How do you force yourself to work when its one of those days that youre struggling to get out of bed or do anything? I have been searching for a job for the past year and I am struggling on how to explain to jobs why I left previous jobs. I left my second job because my family felt like my depression was so bad and I was so suicidal that I needed to be in a psychiatric hospital. So, I quit, because they needed someone to work there and I wasnt even full time and I was unsure of how long I would be in the hospital. I quit my first job because I was working at a call center where I was getting 5080 calls daily and I barely had downtime because of my second shift schedule. I didnt even leave the house on weekends because my social battery would be completely depleted from talking to 100s of people throughout the week. I tell jobs I left for medical reasons, but that doesnt seem to be enough for them when I left two jobs for the same reason. Im only 23. My emotions feel so overwhelming on those bed rotting days and Im already thinking about disappearing and not wanting to be alive more times than I should without my antidepressants psychiatrist practice shut down. Im stressed because I cant find a job because of these and obviously other reasons and Im stressed about what to do on those days that your brain just wants to bedrot. Or youre feeling anxiety about how many people you have to deal with at work. Do I just stop trying to work in customer service. I really feel like Im on my last leg and everything feels so suffocating and not worth it. I dont know want to live my life anymore because it feels like Ive just been on a decline ever since I turned 18. And I dont see it getting any better no matter how many times my family and friends say things will. I just dont believe it. How can I keep going when Im so pessimistic about staying alive.

I was diagnosed with anxiety early this year, I was shocked at the diagnosis but after research, I feel like I finally have an answer to A LOT. My panic attacks and chest pains what I thought were heart attacks were the main problem as well as my overstimulation and constantly thinking the worst. I have a history with adverse effects on medication and therefore I am always reluctant to take them. When my doctor told me that she had meds to help I naturally had many questions. The first was whether they would affect my brain chemistry as I didnt want to feel numb and these tablets didnt. They were sold to me as a dream, they only target physical effects or anxiety i.e. they help with chest tightness and generally calm me down. When I asked potential side effects, I was told they may cause some stomach upset but thats it. Backstory, I have PCOS and suspected endo which causes me to suffer everyday with stomach pains which we still havent gotten to the bottom of. So why the doctor thought these tablets were good for me based off my records, I have zero idea. However, I was willing to take the risk and compared to other meds, these seemed a dream. I was told take them once a day and dont stop them until youve consulted a GP and youre good to go. After a week, I was suffering even worse with my chest tightness and overall mental stability so I checked the leaflet inside the packaging I know I should have done this before and found that these were in fact beta blockers. Since, I have tried contacting the GP so I know I can safely get off these meds but I cannot get through to them for the life of me. Bottom line, Im stuck on this medication that I wasnt properly informed about and its put me in a state of mania and psychosis, not to mention worsening my symptoms.

Ive struggled with depression beginning senior year of high school and it hit full force I barely attended classes but still passed easily because we are a small school and people never fail. I made it into a college with almost a full ride and I achieved that once I talked to financial aid. I feel like I should be happier about this but truthfully I feel like Im wasting it. In the course of the first 3 weeks I missed multiple classes well over 5 times resulting in a meeting to discuss my mental health, but I made an excuse about not having an alarm to wake up. After this it got better after I did get an alarm to wake up but after about a week I would start getting up and turning the alarm off and going back to sleep. I dont do any homework essentially but maintain a social life even though for a good portion of the week I never appear on campus because Im sleeping. Ive requested a counselor, in itself a massive step because I am generally incapable of asking for help or assistance on any matter, especially mental health. I like to think that the state of the country is what consistently gets me down, but Im not exactly at risk for my lifestyle to change because of the election, as Im a cishet white male. Pains come and go in the chest, my mind often seeks emptiness over fullness. I had a phase with DPH which I enjoyed specifically because it made my head emptier, almost like I was dreaming. Thankfully I stopped, but it is scary that the only reason I did was because I do not have any money, at all. This applies to all my previous drugs, cannabis, nicotine, alcohol, etc. If I had money, I would be using them intensively as I did in my senior year. I try not to show this side of me in public but the beginning of college marked a major transformation in my person I was arrogant, talkative, and now I dont generally talk in class, and I dont exactly see myself as a good person anymore, and I think its helped me show this side of me in public, but I fear it isnt enough. People assume Im lazy or otherwise, but it feels as though I physically cant do work I try and the headspace just isnt there. I dont know how else to describe it.

It all makes me incredibly panic and anxious. Got diagnosed with generalized anxiety, started on sertaline.

But Im still struggling hard, especially since tons of surgical complications lead to another surgery last month, so its like its fresh in my mind still.

The reason I sought a diagnosis was because I was terrified of hurting my kids 9m and 10f. Its been over seven years since I even spanked either one, because I was afraid id snap and hurt them. Ever since then, its been a loss of electronics, grounding, extra chores, or going to my moms for the weekend shes a churchgoer and doesnt believe in kids having tech. Their dad and I have been divorced for nine years. So this is all theyve known. We coparent very well. Myself, my ex, and my husband are referred to as the Tribunal of Parentood when it comes to any decision about the kids. Its worked well this whole time. Ive been having issues with my daughter though. My daughter has always been a daddys girl. Whenever we give the kids the choice to go by their dad, she jumps on it. Last night I sent her dad pictures of her room, as we have before to communicate about how they are doing with chores and taking care of their things. I asked him to speak with her about it before they got back, as I was really upset. I found my shoes, clothes, makeup, and office supplies from my home office, all over the place, along with food and drinks, garbage, and broken objects strewn about. Its unlivable. As far as my belongings go, shes never asked, she just goes in my rooms and takes what she wants. She destroyed my foundation, concealer. New sponges ripped apart, bent and cleaned out both of my mascaras. If she asks me, I let her, but I go get it back. When she got back last night, her dad said she didnt want to come home. She sat in her room crying that she couldnt breathe and hyperventilating. I sat with her to calm her and guide her out of the attack. She kept saying shes so sorry and shes so scared. I asked of what. She said shes scared of me. I dont yell anymore, I try talking and having discussions. So I dont know where this is coming from. Shes staying at her dads the rest of the week. I feel like I need to just sign her over to him, transfer schools, and not see her anymore since Im the problem. What do I do?",

Its currently just a blocking of realization I think. I woke up this morning thinking no that didnt actually happen. I luckily have a therapist and psychiatrist who have helped me and can but it still feel kind of alone. The only person I know of who had bipolar was my former partner and she would say I should go get evaluated because it sounded similar tho she had bp1. I cant really go to her for help or support anymore but I know she used to go on here for support and help so I guess thats what Im looking for. I always suspected I had it but just the fear of being told I did or facing the fact thats its not something I can fix on my own was what stopped me. Also the constant change of medication she had to go through and how it affected her always scared me because depending on what she took would affect her very strongly. In summary I dont really know how to move foward or what the best option or what its going to look like because I dont know anyone anymore whos been through it. As scared as I am, I acknowledge that this has progressively gotten worse and affected my mental health, life choices and relationships in such a terrible way that I need to get help.

Unfortunately it all came to an abrupt end when my mom called me and berated me for my decision to put myself into treatment. As a result I had one of the most extreme panic attacks of my life. A few hours later following my parents demands I lied to the nurses, told them I was over reacting, and left. Since this happened I have confided in friends about how hurtful this out of character reaction from my mother was. They surprisingly were not shocked and instead started to bring up instances of similar behavior. Personally, I have limited or even no recollection of most of the events they mentioned. After talking to them, a few nights later I just suddenly remembered a particularly painful and in turn shocking memory surrounding my parents. Admittedly it feels as though I cannot trust my own memory. My parents and I have had some very rough patches but Ive always felt as though they had my best interests at heart. Could these be repressed memories? I feel like I could honestly be making this all up subconsciously because of what my friends have told me and my drug use.

        "input": "I read a medical articleand passed out Fainting is a common experience. It seems that between a third and twofifths of the population faint at least once during their lives. Some peoples lives are blighted by frequent fainting episodes. Im lucky by comparison Ive only fainted once and had one nearmiss. It happened long ago. But its an incident that stands out in my life, because it came as a shock, and triggered painful emotions. So perhaps it may be worth recording here. As a child and adolescent, I had strong tendencies to both squeamishness and health anxiety. I was particularly afraid of the idea of fainting. I thought it would be embarrassing, even humiliating to faint. There were certain experiences, I knew, that might trigger and reveal my sensitivities. I put up defences against them. I managed to give up studying biology before I had to do dissections. I avoided certain films, like The Exorcist, that were regarded as horrific if people in the cinema were fainting, I would not be one of them. But I also didnt want my mother to be aware of my sensitivity or of any trait that might be classed as weakness or unmanliness. I got through to my eighteenth year without ever fainting, without ever coming close. And then it happened It was a quiet evening at home. I was sitting in an armchair, reading a magazine. My mother was sitting opposite. I came to an article about heart attacks. There were interviews with celebrity victims, descriptions, diagrams. References to pains in the chest bulked large. I never finished the article. Part of the way through, I fainted. At the time, I didnt actually know what was going on. It was just that as I read my own sensations started to overwhelm me. I seemed to be experiencing what I was reading about. I felt a horrible pressure in my own chest, I broke into a sweat. Sleepiness, a nasty sickly kind of sleepiness came over me, as if Id been drugged. I couldnt fight it I couldnt keep my eyes open. I was frightened. I wondered if I was having a heart attack. I felt my eyes closing, against my will. I lost consciousness. My eyes opened. I was still in my chair. Sweaty, weak, confused, still a bit frightened. The fear subsided whatever had happened, it seemed to be over. I didnt know I had lost consciousness I thought that perhaps I had just closed my eyes for a second, like you do when youre tired. But my mother was looking intently at me. She told me I had fainted. I think I tried to deny it surely Id know if Id fainted. But she was very clear that thats what had happened. Somehow it was worse to be told I had fainted than to realize it for myself. And the thought I had fainted in front of my mother was painful it seemed to bring back childhood vulnerabilities. But that wasnt all she asked me why it had happened, and I had to confess that Id been overcome by reading a medical article in a magazine. It seemed such a pathetic reason. I felt I had lost face. I was not simply embarrassed but ashamed of myself, as if the incident revealed a fundamental weakness. I suppose there must be some personality trait that caused me to faint when another person would not have done squeamishness? high sensitivity? empathy? anxiety? I dont know. What I do know is that I became angry with myself, as if that would get rid of the feeling of shame. Memory and forgetting are remarkable things. As time passed, and I acquired more experiences, I managed to forget what had happened. It didnt seem to be connected with the rest of my life. The remembrance came back years later when I was waiting to be put to sleep for surgery and the doctor asked me, among other things, if I had ever fainted. At first I said no. Then I remembered As I said, this event stands out as an isolated episode in my life, and yet it also seems to be one of those experiences that reveal you to yourself. As I recall it now, I remember the intensity of the sensations I felt before losing consciousness and of the emotions I felt when I regained it. Except for the brief period of unconsciousness, I was in a way very much alive. Thats why in a way, though I hated it at the time, Im grateful to have had this brief encounter with fainting. And I feel a kind of solidarity with other people who have had the experience. Whether you have or not, thank you if you have read this far.",

Suicide used to be a thought i had usually out of spite or complete hysteria, but the last year or so its been something i think of randomly, in the middle of the day, when nothings wrong. I cant seem to live this life correctly, ive always felt like im doing everything wrong, school, work, relationships, friendships, family, i fail in every aspect of life constantly, and even if its in my head ive never felt truly happy about myself or who i am. Im addicted to weed because it is the only thing that has ever made me feel like i can look at life and think like a normal happy person. it helps me to calm down, but it doesnt take away the thoughts. socially im super bubbly and positive, i dont think anyone, even my parents who know about my history with struggling, would ever expect me to do anything to harm myself. But i would. i could. and i might. its almost like theres an evil version of myself that lives in my mind and wants me to end it all, and im afraid one day i will. im against prescription medication that doesnt directly keep you from dying, so ive never been interested in being medicated. I dont believe ill ever get married or have kids to a happy family, even if my career is booming i dont have confidence that ill be able to keep doing it or that ill make it. bottom line is i deeply hate myself. All i want to do is lay down, i never have any real energy, and the happy bubbly persona i put up for those around me is a version of me that doesnt actually exist. i tell myself it gets better and sometimes i feel like it does, until one small thing happens or one bad mood comes through and im back where i started. if i were to do it id jump off of something so i hopefully dont have to experience any pain. the idea of suicide used to be about revenge, about wanting them to realize how bad i was hurting, for everyone to feel bad and realize i needed help this whole time, and that i was nice and understanding because i wished someone would treat me that way, but now its about myself. i want out. i care less and less about the pain i will cause my family because i am exhausted. the main thing that holds me back is the fact that i believe in reincarnation. whats the point of dying if i cant even rest and ill immediately have to do it all over again but from the beginning. I love my family, and i know they love me, i have good friends, a good job, i dont struggle financially, there is nothing wrong with my life, but i am not happy. i dont think i ever will be. I was hospitalized for a respiratory infection the first time ive actually been a patient at a hospital and the idea of being ill and not having to do anything but lay there and rest was the best feeling ive experienced in a very long time. maybe im lazy, so lazy i rather die than fight, i can fake happiness and try to convince myself that its better, but it never truly is.

I was still hypomanic when I decided to register for a college program. Primary Care Paramedic training at a local college near me. I had thought about becoming a paramedic before and when I found the program it felt like it was right. I signed up pretty quickly and began school in October. I studied for a month and was doing very well. I was acing most of my anatomy and physiology tests and completing all homework on time, I also didnt miss a day. I got the flu and missed two days of school and when I went back I had a quiz that I got 50 on. This triggered me to start thinking about dropping out. I convinced myself that the program wasnt the right thing for me to do right now and I withdrew from my studies all in one day. Part of my decision is made because I am not sure being a paramedic would be a healthy career for me. I think the long shifts and stressful workload could potentially worsen my illness. I also believe I couldve done great in the program and could have become an excellent paramedic. Now Im falling into a bit of a slump because no longer do I have something that gets me up every morning and I feel confused about what Im going to do with my life. The victory is that I didnt get charged for the program so I only lost 500 bucks for the registration fee and a pair of boots I bought for my practicum.

Ill start, Ive always been a bit of a difficult teenager but nothing out of the normal really just pretty reckless like sneaking out constantly, hanging out with people that I shouldnt and smoking weed starting at 14. When I was 17 is when I started realizing something was not right up there. For a period of time I fully believed that there were secret cameras that were watching me at all times, in my room, in the bathroom and everywhere I went so I believed I had to act perfect because well Im always being watched. Once I got over this I realized something is definitely not right, I would also obsess over things like what I had done in the past and it would send me into a spiral, my mom was worried and suggested that I see a therapist or something which I didnt do of course. What made me finally get help was when I had my first full blown manic episode that lasted months, in this time I knew something was wrong bec I didnt feel real, was VERY reckless, did things I would NEVER do when stable and its like I became a whole other person, I lost my morals, my way of thinking, I became very outgoing when Im normally a shy person and practically messed up my life in the matter of 4 months, then that ended and I fell into a big depressive episode, I finally realized everything I had done and I felt horrible I couldnt even believe it, I didnt even want to live, I was disgusted of the person I had become. This being my first manic episode where I was destructive, I knew something was wrong but I didnt know what or how to fix it, so I let my mind take over. It took me a while after that to finally get help, when I did I got diagnosed bipolar. Now I go to therapy and take my pills. Ive had other manic episodes after that one but nothing destructive.

I responded by reiterating that with li claim if further injury were to occur the company would be liable but with fmla accommodations are allowed because held to different standard. She seemed annoyed at my response and said grievance of not having someone to cover my work with another going out for surgery next week. I decided to validate her feeling stressed by saying it sounds like it is stressful to figure out the coverage and I will be available to support the staff as the cover my workload as able. This is the second time she has mentioned this the first time I had a trauma response and my reaction was not based in reality but the past i will link my response below. This time nothing is being triggered but it still feels like she should not be saying this to me and that it is inappropriate. I am unsure if her intentions are ha rmful on purpose or she is just stressed and taking it out on me and harmful without knowing. Am I overreactingthinking about this and should I just let what has been said go or should I talk to union rep? I also feel conflicted to do this as I like my manager and she has never crossed my boundaries when speaking to me outside of Li claim. Post when told something similar and response differed trauma triggered Li triggered ptsd at work I just completely dissociated at work and when coworker asked if okay i broke down crying. I used a photo of a good memory to bring me to an ok place now. I am currently on li and my manager was surprised my light duty was extended by doctor. I realized I dont know much about li and so I looked into it.

I tend to identify as agnostic, leaning towards atheist, but I grew up Catholic. I find my mania is usually kicked off by some kind of spiritual event. The first time I noticed this happening was last year. During my sophomore year of college, there was a joke on campus that a cultlike frat summoned the demon Furfur. I fully bought in and was terrified. I prayed fervently, hailMarys over and over. I didnt go to class, but I did go to my colleges career fair that day where I tracked down my friends and warned them of the demon on the loose. I calmed down by the end of the day, and in the morning I had to send out embarrassed apologies to all of my friends who were very scared and startled at me, their typically levelheaded friend, warning them of a demon in the form of a deer come to burn down our school. Now, today Im at work right now. I work in an office so I was listening to a podcast while I work. One of the podcasts mentioned a book listing many demons and what they do called The Lesser Key of Solomon. Immediately, I found a pdf of the book on my phone and dropped what I was doing at work to read the whole thing in about 10 minutes Im a fast reader naturally and the manichigh made it even faster. I decided I wanted to try to summon one of the demons in the book for personal reasons. I researched the demon and made a plan to summon it to get what I desire from it. I even applied to get approved access to a restricted demonology subreddit to get advice on summoning it. Im shaking, my vision feels extra clear, quick heartbeat, etc. I feel embarrassed that I totally fell for another spiritual manic episode. Does anyone else go through this?",

So I was just having a hard time even accepting what was happening. So I started lying to myself I told myself hes being rough and thats hot Ive decided not humiliating not disturbing and so I focused on that . And then that didnt help because then I felt like a slut. When I told my therapist she just judged me then basically asked if i enjoyed it n I clearly didnt . I tried to tell her he was too rough and being an inexperienced like terrified virgin I didnt know how to cope at all with it. Of course I went into denial play I disassociated .. But maybe the truth is it was confusing because it still sounded I hate admitting this like its so fucking embarrassing too like I swear to god if not for hookup culture I wouldve told people my boyfriend SA me. Instead I just felt humiliated that I hadnt done it yet and that I wasnt ready. I basically blamed myself for not putting out n I thought so will everyone else. I thought Im here with him in his room alone I knew how it looked. I knew people would judge me and I was right some of them did but fuck them. Anyway.. I didnt know wtf was going on and I dissociated really badly and so I kept just like idk I had this expectation that when Id do it, Id be ready. I never thought hed just make me.

I had one place in mind and I didnt even try very hard for the application, even though I thought I really wanted it. When I didnt get in I sunk into a deep depression, sometime before or after I found out I was missing a credit and wouldnt graduate with the rest of my class. There was some shock and then later terror and more depression, but never resolve to change it. Never foresight to see that coming. No attempt to try multiple different programs. I also somewhat understand my actions now as someone who was passively suicidal. I didnt just not care about my future, I had almost no plan and when that didnt take I wanted to crawl under my bed and die. For years leading up it was like I had no future. I struggled in school like many others but I had skills. I wanted to be a filmmaker. For reason it always felt, especially now in hindsight, more of a fantasy than a reality I could live out. Over and over again I tried to restart my life but I would just abandon my plans. I never had to be afraid of going homeless, but suddenly now, years later, Im afraid of so much more. Im buried on guilt and shame, and fear that Ill be alone forever, or on the street, or insane. Where was that fear before? Is that all that motivates people? I was convinced people hsd genuine hopes and dreams...and maybe I was just broken down way before I had a chance... I dont know how to talk about it, or relate to anyone around me. I felt more in good company at the psych ward. I relate more to addicts and the homeless but youd never know it looking at me or the life Ive lived. People probably think Im just a big loser or a weakling. The few whove heard my story know how deeply wounded I am. Maybe thats all I have left? My story yknow? And the days I am most scared is when I tell myself that its no longer good enough to tell it, but I fight that.",

Im new to bipolar and am interested in hearing about hearing your guys journey to getting the diagnosis and proper treatment, along with any advice or answers to some questions!! I met with my psychiatrist and they prescribed me a medication for bipolar II typically I think, although I feel like he didnt really listen to me during the appointment and kept rushing it. Looking at the after visit notes they werent that accurate either and had things that we didnt discuss or things that I said the opposite of. Ive been to my primary care doctor and neurologist and everything comes up normal for that, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism along the way and got prescribed a medication for that. But my primary care doctor said he doesnt think whats happening is due to hypothyroidism because its been happening in relatively consistent episodes. I have a few other questions and Im just wondering because sometimes just googling things can be difficult to gain answers. Do you guys have a consistent schedule sort of with episodes? For example, I tend to have 1.52 weeks where Im perfectly normal and then a depressive episode for 10 days practically always 10 days, then cant sleep and hyper for about four afterwards. The pattern seems to be pretty consistent too for the past few months and Im not sure if thats common consistent with bipolar. During your depressive episodes do you guys experience disassociation depersonalization derealization? Thats mainly all of what mine tend to consist of and with a general feeling of sadness and feeling like I want to cry. Are you guys easily suggestible during a depressive episode? One of my friends called one of my cats fat as a joke because they love to eat. Then the rest of the episode I thought my cats sides were bulging and she was gonna explode sort of. I was able to somewhat calm myself and tell myself it wasnt true, but whenever I looked at her thats what I saw. Until the episode ended and I realized she was perfectly healthy weight and her sides werent bulging at all and she wasnt gonna explode. I couldnt find the pending diagnosis flair when I searched for it. Sorry, this is my first time making a post to Reddit!! I appreciate any answers from anyone thats comfortable, no pressure in providing any at all!!",

I think Im worried that he will suddenly disconnect or turn cold or abusive theres no evidence of this so far in our relationship, but I am a survivor of abuse so I imagine its residue from my past experience.

When I was maybe between 68, I remember my older cousin doing sexual things with me and my other cousin who was a year younger than me. She is 6 years older than me so a teenager at the time and she would dry hump with us when we were alone. I always was aware of this happeningI mightve forgot years after it happened and I sort of just ignored it or maybe tried to cope with it by thinkin it was just a really weird thing that happened but I guess Im my head somewhat consensual. This was my earliest memory of knowing what sex was. This ended up with me growing up with a rather bad relationship with sex not to mention Ive had OCD since a child and only recently found out. Sexual OCD is probably the hardest ocd type for me to deal with. I just dont know what to feel. I actually got close with her as an adult but I just feel super weird now bein a lot more conscious about this. My biggest struggle in life is OCD so most of my trauma feels tied to that but I never really considered how much of an impact this had on me cuz I just didnt want to think abt it. I think another bad part abt this is the fact that me and my cousin who i mentioned before did actually end up doin inappropriate things wit each other and actually got caught kissing once, the most awful part I hate is the fact that after this there was a time with my other younger cousin where I pulled their pants down and told my uncle and I got screamed at of course rightfully so, pulling their pants down was all that happened and I always get scared thinkin abt what if things wouldve gone further. Its so gross and Ive honestly lived with so much guilt from this. Im positive my family doesnt even know that my older cousin was the one that introduced these behaviors to me and my younger cousin. Just feel uneasy abt this dont even feel super scared cuz I worked thru so much of my anxiety living with OCD but I just feel super queasy and numb right now.",

My mom used to put weed or meth in a cigarette carton, then would send me as her little messenger even in snow storms to these 2 scary people in my neighborhood. Her best friend was a drug dealer. His daughter was my age, and they forced us to be friends from kindergarten on. My mom never listened to me and made me go with him for carpooling. I would get sick and puke in his car because the smell was so bad and I would be so scared that it came out physically. At their house, it was in middle of no where in the woods, so big, an intercom and cameras everywhere, he apparently worked at a tile business but was NEVER at work, he always had robberies, family members would randomly die, scary people would show up at their house coming and going all day, he would drive us to random towns for meals to meet people. He was arrested by the time we were seniors in high school. He wrote my mom, and he was released right before I went NC. She picked me up at train station, and started taking me to his house. She was laughing as I cried and begged not to take me near him. Then that last xmas with my mom, my 3 brothers ditched me and went to our other side of the family party so I was stuck with her. She drove me to an abandoned apartment complex, took me in an abandoned apartment trap house with 2 creepy guys, and started snorting stuff in front of me while they asked if I wanted any. WHAT. I just dont get why these people would put me in harms way so much. Even my grandfather was a creep, like would put his arm around my moms waist and stuff and touch her. A classic narc, very wealthy and powerful. He used to tickle my 3 brothers, and they HATED IT. They would beg my dad not to let my grandfather do that to them, but my dad was too intimidated by him to protect my brothers. So, the last time I saw my mom she dropped me off at train station. 7 min away. She told my brothers laughing, and told me to scare me that shes taking me 1 hour away to a dangerous area of the city to figure it out with the bad guys. Just to see me scared. Its sick.

Shes pretty against big pharma and has never felt like her meds have helped her mentally so shes not taking anything and just genuinely wants a good therapist. i dont like better help and sites like that i feel like they are more profit oriented than establishing a good connection with someone so please any advice on how i can help or clinics to look into???",

        "input": "Our mostbroken and leastunderstood rules is helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort, so weve made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster. it usually works out quite differently here than when you say PM me anytime in a casual social context. We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves. Were hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here this is just a small start. Our new wiki page explains in detail why its much better to respond in public comments, at least until youve gotten to know someone. It will be maintained at rdepressionwikiprivatecontact, and the full text of the current version is below. Summary Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement. Either way, its unwise to trust them. PM me anytime seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly wellmeaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, its just not a wise idea. Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately. By posting supportive replies publicly, youll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, youll educate and inspire other helpers. The 1990 rulehttpsen.wikipedia.orgwiki125ruleInternetculture applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet. People who are struggling with serious mentalhealth issues often justifiably have a low tolerance for disappointment and a highlevel of everchanging emotional need. Unless the helper is able to make a 100 commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good. This is why mentalhealth crisisline responders usually dont give their names and callers arent allowed to request specific responders. Its much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole. Analogously, its much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole. Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work highintensity situations alone. Its partly about availability, but its mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mentalhealth issues including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression escalate, in a PM conversation its much harder for others, including the rdepression and rSuicideWatch moderators to help. Contrary to common assumptions, moderators cant see or police PMs. In our observation over many years, the people who say PM me the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mentalhealth issues and mentalhealth support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively. Community input mitigates these limitations. Theres no reason why someone whos truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny. If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that selfdisclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of altthrowaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma. We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others. These people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mentalhealth issues. If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, theyve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers. This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someones in a state of mentalhealth crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning. If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wideopen anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we dont recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

We have always intended for rAnxiety to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things. Political anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples Timeout Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stressinducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break. Control The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing selfcare through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on selfcare MHA Taking Good Care of Yourselfhttpsmhanational.orgtakinggoodcareyourself NHS SelfHelp Therapieshttpswww.nhs.ukmentalhealthtalkingtherapiesmedicinetreatmentstalkingtherapiesandcounsellingselfhelptherapies El Camino Health Emotional Self Carehttpswww.elcaminohealth.orgcommunitychinesehealthinitiativespecialtyprogramsemotionalwellbeingemotionalselfcare Community Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress. Engage The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of likeminded people, which helps to alleviate stress. If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services.

Ill be altering the names and location for privacy purposes On Sunday September 9th, 2018 my life changed. Ill start off with, I was spending FridaySunday with my cousin down at her house. Friday and Saturday were great, and nothing crazy happened. But Sunday is when things took a turn for the worst. We went to my uncles her dads house to watch the Browns VS Steelers football game, now not only did we tie, I was the only Steelers fan in the house, everyone else was a browns fan. We stayed later than we anticipated because we were just spending time with family, I was playing and goofing around with my cousins boyfriends son and then my cousins nephew, just playing with swords and all his other toys. We finally get her nephew to fall asleep, and that was our queue to leave before he woke up. The day had been gloomy and rainy, but my cousins boyfriend needed to stop at a redbox to drop off some movies that he rented for some of his clients hes a Corrections officer at a rehab facility, so we drop them off, and as we pull out we obviously check both ways and not a single car is coming. We pull up to the red light, and while we are waiting for it to change were just messing around with Jake who is the son to my cousins boyfriend about how hes farting and its gross, when all of a sudden we get rear ended. My four month old cousin cries instantly, my cousin jumps out of the car and confronts the person, Brian cousins boyfriend is trying to calm down the baby, meanwhile I jump out and my cousin says to call the cops. I jump into the car and grab my phone, and I dial 911 but its not going through, Ive had so many nightmares where that happens, so I burst into tears because it wouldnt connect. Finally it connects to the operator and heres how the conversation goes 911 operator 911 whats your emergency? Me hi my family and I were just rear ended at a red light Operator okay mam where is your location? Me Blank, Ohio Operator okay what road are you on? Me Im not sure, Im not from around this area but we have a Walgreens to the left of us and a mr hero and a Georgios to the right and a sign for highway blank across the street. Operator so your at blank road? Me I guess? Im not from around here so I dont know the name of it? Operator do you need an ambulance? Me yes Id say we do because theres a 4 month old in the car Operator okay they are on their way, bye So the operator hangs up the phone, and I hear sirens from behind us. A cop shows up, immediately after a fire truck pulls up onto the sidewalk next to us, and another cup comes from another direction and then pulls up in front of us. At this point Im hyperventilating because Ive never been in a car accident before and was totally freaked out. The cop asks me if Im okay, and I immediately respond with I have anxiety! And he goes okay, well youre hyperventilating, which is only going to make this worse, take some deep breathes for me okay? So I start taking breaths and he asks for my ID, and I say I have temps but they are expired, and says that its okay, so I hand it to him and he says you live at 12345 road? I reply with yes, he asks for my name and phone number. I accidentally give him my moms number instead of my own, because I was really worked up. At this point its really starting to rain, and Im feeling very light headed so I sit in the car, and suddenly I feel like Im gonna get sick, but I look up and a cop is walking towards me as I open the door and start to get sick. This happens a few times, and I feel awful about it because it happened anytime a cop came near me. I eventually calm down enough to write a police statement, and a release form for the paramedics saying I wasnt going to the hospital via an ambulance. Its at this point Im starting to feel a lot of pain in my back and my neck, I should mention Im already in physical therapy for chronic migraines and back pain, and I immediately knew that this wasnt good Once we get that settled, we drive to this offstanding emergency room down the road from the accident and close to my uncles house",

Few years went by, got my own place. Working. Things goin well. Until recently, Im 25 about to be 26 and i dont catch those thoughts anymore, they slip past me. I hate myself. I wake up and feel nothing anymore, I still try but its getting harder and harder everyday. Other than anxiety, sadness is all I feel. Idk really what to do anymore.

Unfortunately it was really hard for anyone to notice and i think it still is. My grades never suffered because of it. I was a straight A student until today. I did self harm in ways that didnt leave a physical mark on my body, I was afraid of anything more so i had no scars to explain and no reason to worry friends or teachers. My mom threatened to pull me out of school and have me sent to a psych ward if i did it again. She hates psych wards and made them sound as scary as possible. I never had a big public breakdown like i thought depressed people would. I no longer want to harm myself and dont have the energy for that sort of thing. It scares me and triggers me without a doubt. But life still sucks terribly, and I dont know how to feel. I wonder if I had acted out more, if I had been more of a bad kid, that I would have received more help then I have today. Im frustrated. No visible signs that I am depressed, and no proof for others that I need help. Im still someone who gets their work done and looks fairly normal on the outside. It sucks and I hate it. Im only just staring therapy and only because its free. I cant afford it otherwise and dont have a a job. I feel like if I say the wrong thing im going to get locked up in a ward like my mom told me.

Im 23 now and I think a lot of it is back. But for no reason. Im aware of retraumatization but NOTHING happened. I just noticed hypervigilance, tunnel vision, and mild dissociation is occurring now whenever Im out at night, even in groups of people and in safe environments. I have a really bad phobia unrelated to ptsd fully irrational one and lately it has been so bad that I am constantly panicking no matter where I am. The thing is Ive noticed my phobia gets more active when other things are at issue and although its always bad, it isnt always cant walk down the street at night bad. So when Im having my hypervigilance etc. walking at night I am actively panicking about my phobia but the symptoms match what ptsd was like for me and are the same severity of my ptsd hypervigilance when the phobia version was never THAT bad. In shortcan ptsd randomly resurface with no external factors after years of it not really being an issue due to ART?

My gfs 23 F family own a mini market which is right next to her house. my gf and I where hanging out in a little staff office in the mini market when her dad and one of the employees walked in, the employee was very distressed and my my gfs dad explained that one of her employees 40 F got electrocuted by touching an outlet. my gf and her dad left to go see what happened with the outlet and i was left with the employee, i noticed she was looking extremely anxious and since i know how anxiety attacks are I tried comforting her and teaching her how to do breathing exercises to calm her down, when she was doing better i want to check on my gf an her dad, they where checking the security cameras and her dad was extremely mad because in the video he saw she touched her own phone charger not the outlet which she was trying to blame and he went to question her about it being very disrespectful and mean to her despite her being in an obviously bad state. seeing this whole situation made me very upset and it started bringing me flashbacks to situations where i was having anxiety episodes and people where yelling at me and putting me in even more distressed, i didnt say anything at the time but i was felt very dissociated and anxious after that. then my gf went to tell her mom about everything that happened while I was there, her mom and I have always gotten along fairly well despite her usually being a very antisocial person. her mom started defending that it was good that she got yelled at, saying that she deserved it and that she was exaggerating and a manipulative liar thats when i got re triggered. i started feeling the face of everyone who had treated me that way in her face. i was so mad and stressed. i started crying and telling her how ive been in situations like that and that people deserve empathy especially it situations where they went through something terrifying and they arent doing well, the only thing that should matter is their well being nothing else. i noticed how i couldnt even talk right anymore and i didnt even know who i was talking to anymore so i left. my gf followed me and tried comforting me but i started realizing how much i fucked up and she definitely looked worried about it too. i told her i would apologize and before i left she went to her mom telling her about how i wanted to apologize but she refused to hear me. a week later my gf went to her family home again and talked to her mom about it trying to give her my apologies and explain the situation but her mom was still mad and told her that she didnt want me to go to her house anymore and tried telling my gf basically that im a bad person for doing what i did and that she should leave me. now I dont know what to do. my gf is very understanding of my but shes also a bit disappointed by what i did and her mom is still mad.

Last year was probably the worst year of my life abuse wise and the only reason I am here today is because of my sister, I can tell you right now my mother wouldve killed me or I wouldve killed myself if it werent for her. Now my sisters in college and its just me all alone, everything has been okayish, or as okay as it can be so far. With the occasional hits and fights and having to deal with my mother drunkhigh.

As I said before shes bipolar. Im not sure why Im freaking out, but also sad that its my first concert my sister wont be at because shes in college, and my dads working, so I have no one here. Another thing is ive been very hypervigilant because I can tell my mothers becoming manic and that mixed with the drugs sends her into this sorry if Im misusing the term but like almost drug induced psychosis. Yesterday she was just standing outside out house with no shirt on screaming and banging on the garage doors and house and screaming at no one. But what makes me most nervous is how bad it got last time. Last time it got like this there was one really bad day, she basically tried to rape my father, and when he tried to get away she put a knife to him and then gave him the knife and started screamingcrying and begging him to murder her and when he wouldnt kill her because why tf would he she punched him in the face repeatedly till he got a black eye, and then she came upstairs and was yelling at my sister so I was like leave her alone and she ended up coming to me and shoved me againt the wall, then putting me to the window telling me to jump out and kill myself and that no one needs me and stuft and I dont even know if id be here right now if it werent fir my sister who intervened. But im really freaking out right now an idek what I was lookijng to get out of this post other than to say I need help and I dont know what to do. Im just a kid.

My wife doesnt work due to the baby and i work full time. Due to some unforseen circumstances, in 2022 we ended up moving in with her parents. Since then, i feel like its been the worst decision of my life. I do not get along with her father, he judges me constantly and talks about me constantly behind my back, etc. I know im not perfect but he is constantly on my case about literally everything and at this point its just annoying. Ive became extremely detached from everything since being here. It actually feels very similar to my childhood situation when i lived with my emotionless mother, i use to lock myself away which is what is happening now. I have tried to be better I have gone to therapy, seen a psychologist, taken medication for anxiety and depression, gone to the gym, and eaten better. No matter what I do, someone points out that I am doing things wrong. Youre not a real man because you dont have your own place and cannot provide for your family or You dont go to the gym enough you make excuses. These comments trigger PTSDlike symptoms in me because my father used to say similar things, as did my mothers husband. I dont know why the adult men around me feel the need to target me like this, but my therapist suggested that it might be because they are intimidated by me. I dont know. The gym thing, for example, I used to go four to five days a week. My wife complained that it was hard for her to watch the baby for longer hours and asked if I could cut back, so I did. I would come home and take care of the baby until I got rest for work. I ended up only going to the gym one to three times a week. Guess what happened next? He came and said I was making excuses and that I wasnt man enough to make time to go to the gym more. I was done. Since that altercation, I decided not to care anymore and just do what I feel is right, but nothing I do is right to anyone. Even my marriage is extremely strained. I want to move out, but I dont want to leave my daughter behind. I know with work and everything it will be hard for me to tend to her on my own, so the best bet is to have her stay with her mom, but I just cant find it in me to leave. Its also hard due to financial reasons places around me charge an arm and a leg. My therapist asked me what I have done so far in life, and the only things I can think of are that I graduated high school, left for the Army right after and served six years, work fulltime now, and have a child. She tells me to feel proud of my accomplishments, but others put them down. Im just at a loss and dont know what to do with my life. I know Im not perfect, but why do people feel the need to point out all my flaws and problems? Some days I just want to end it all, and others I feel like I cant miss out on my little ones life as she would need me. I am sorry again for this long post.",

So I F18 have had a really unpleasant experience which made me super vigilant when it comes to anything sexual probably considered secondary PTSD, ive read messages of my mom describing how she got rped and sexually abused when she was a child, but this is a whole other story. I started getting flashbacks of my dad touching me when i was younger mostly grabbing my butt and spanking me, I also kind of remember him touching my private parts in one occasion. Im not so sure about this one but i do remember him lifting my robe once while i was sleeping to look at me. He has always done lots of commenting of my body, i dont wanna go into detail but it makes me super uncomfortable when he does it. One time when i asked him to stop i kind of said it in an impolite manner he got angry and defensive literally grabbed my arm and dragged me into my room and was about to hit me, so i just stopped arguing and instead i just avoid him as much as I can. He also looks at me weirdly I mean he really keeps looking at my body when i talk to him, i dont know whether he does it subconsciously but it really makes me uncomfortable I cant see a reason why youd keep looking up and down on someone thats talking to you, like just look into their eyes?, he once even checked me out and literally bit his lip and gave me the most gross lusty look Ive ever seen on a mans face. All of the shit he diddoes combined with what i vaguely remember makes me truly despise him. It makes me feel so vulnerable and unsafe, it really distresses me that i get nightmares about it. I dont know how to think of him anymore, in my head hes just a gross person that i wouldnt ever wanna call my father. On the other hand i keep thinking but what if he doesnt mean it and im just interpreting his actions wrongly. What if im just projecting what happened to my mom upon myself. Hes kind of nice to me and it looks like he cares about me. Hes also really clingy and demanding, he gets pissed off when i avoid him so i have to compensate for it from time to time. The thing is we interact normally, all of what he doesdid iswas very causal, I just brush it off most of the time and I think he thinks his behavior is normal. We have discussed things related to sexual abuse like seeing on the news that some girl got molested by a family member for example and he does criticize or at least frown upon that kinda behavior hes fairly religious, or at least he thinks he is. Although his actions really distress me, i cant help but think that he innocently does the shit he does and im the one overreacting here.",

I grew up with a loving family and was the eldest between me and my brother blah blah blah. I was raised in my life that I should dedicate my life to paying my family back for raising me. But the way I was taught growing up forced me to be a loner and loser. Rules. 1. I could only wear clothes and accessories approved by my family. 2. My male friends were strictly vetted to the point where my family would even call these peoples parents and tell them not to let their kids associate. 3. If i was found with a females number on my phone i was be strictly disciplined. included the parents talking to not let us associate. Punishments for these included not being able to enjoy hobbies, beatings, emotional abuse, and more than once I was locked in my basement. My cousin that i grew up with maybe two years older then me. He continually lied on my name. Telling my parents i did something i didnt do or said something i didnt say. Leading to more of these punishments. At one point my punishment was to go to school, come home. And be locked in my room with literally nothing. Not even a paper and pen. no books. No entertainment. All because he said i disrespected him in a way i didnt do. At one point i broke down leading my family to forced me to attend this religious focus group that taught me basically the same rules listed above. And i did it because maybe if i made my parents happy i could get some sort of freedom. All of this led me to be the loner and loser i am today. unable to make friends. Unable to find a relationship with girls. I dont even fit into my local community. People will say out loud not to talk to me and that im weird or challenged or some other horrible disrespectful stuff pertaining to my race or character or upbringing. Now here comes my brother. Someone who didnt have to follow any of these rules. Who wasnt brought up with a shit bag cousin lying on his name. He gets whatever designer clothes he wants. Allowed to wear gold and silver I was beaten for asking the same. Allowed to be friends with whoever he wants. Allowed to go to other females houses something i was locked away for even asking for. Mother fucker even had sex on MY bed while both our parents were downstairs. Uk who drove him to these females houses while girls in bikinis were waiting outside for him. Me. Uk what would happen if i refused? This emotionally manipulative bullshit that i owe my family for raising me. Raising me how? To be a fucking loser? To not let me enjoy the life he was given the freedom to have. My ex that i have fought tooth and nail to be with left me not to long ago and ill explain why. My parents didnt like her and at times disrespected her. They told both of us if we got married to never speak to them again. My little brother was allowed to go to whore after whores house with me as his personal driver but i finally find someone special to me thats my treatment? Yea i couldve been better to at times. But i was never taught how to love or interact properly. Even she said it to me before it ended. I dont plan to hurt myself in anyway. But i want to carve my heart out. i explained all this to my family before but all they say is stop saying this its in the past, while i watch my younger sibling do everything i wanted to do. If or when i do decide enough is enough. i want them to read this over my corpse. I dont have enough money to be able to leave. If i did and i didnt have to pay my parents for raising me along with school bills and whatnot i would have left a long time ago. But im also scared to leave. Even if im treated poorly its better then being alone. With my skills i wouldnt even make new friends. id be alone in my apartment anyway. Sorry about all the grammar and spelling mistakes im tired.

When I got back to school in 2022, it didnt feel the same. I was a freshman in high school and I was already worried about that fact. When it started, I was extremely worried about talking to people. I started to mumble when I talked to people, I talked quieter, and because of those 2 things on top of me being already worried, I think it sent me into a depression. I developed body dysmorphia, I stopped talking to my classmates. I didnt realize what was happening to me at the time but now its so clear. I clearly knew something was wrong, but I thought I was just being dramatic. Probably for the last 3 months or so, I was feeling more confident about my self. I started to go out of my comfort zone more often. I began going to the gym more. Ive been getting better for a while and I didnt even realize. Ive been looking up how it feels to come out of being depressed, and its pretty much exactly what Im feeling. The sun shines brighter, you feel better about yourself, you start talking to people more, you think about things differently and in a better way, you feel like you can pretty much do anything. A few days ago I woke up, and something was very different. I used to get mad about every little thing in the world. I would hate people for no reason. Id hate myself. A few days ago, its like I just woke up and knew something was different. Its like there was a switch inside of me that was stuck in the sad position. I felt as if no one was looking at me as close as before. For the past 4 years Ive felt as though every single one of my moves was being watched. Every time someone laughed around me I would think they were laughing about me. I felt very self conscious about the clothes I was wearing and even things as small as where I was putting my hands. The past few days Ive been thinking it might be mania or something. I dont have a history of being bipolar or anything, but Ive heard of it. Now I look back and see that I was just getting better. Its like those 3 months were building up to this exact moment, and the switch finally flipped. I feel as though I will never go back to who I was during those 4 years. I would have never been able to sit here and write all of these words in the state I was in. I have never felt so clear minded in my life. Its like Im a kid again, with no worries in the world I think and know now that depression takes time to heal from. If you are suffering from anything that sounds like mine, please get help! It is no way to live how I was for so long. I was so scared to reach out and talk about my feelings. But you shouldnt be. Everyone thinks the same, no one is looking at you, youre simply a person, trying to do the best they can. I feel like I am alive again, and you will too when you get through it. It definitely takes time, when youre in a depressive state you dont believe any of the words that are said to you, but just trust me cause I have literally felt the same way. Dont ever think that you are never gonna be better, because you genuinely will, I never thought I would ever be the same again. And if you are coming out of your own depression, its normal to kind of obsess about how you randomly got better one day. I just thought I might help a few of you. Just trust the words I say, and you can get better. Food tastes a lot better",

I really enjoy our conversations and dont want to lose you as a friend Today, we were studying at the library and he was like, Why wont you let anyone get close to you? Ive been watching you and I can tell that youre trying to keep everyone at a distance. I told him to stop asking questions hes not ready to hear the answer to, then we went back to studying. A few minutes later, he asked me if I would ever have a one nightstand with someone and I said, Absolutely not. Can we stop talking about this? I thought you wanted to work on this paper we have to write. He stopped for a little bit, then asked me if I was a virgin. I didnt answer so he started talking about how he wants to be someones first and to take a girls virginity. Something about the way he said it really triggered me and I think he saw the look on my face because he asked if I regret my first time. I just started crying and told him that it was forced on me, that I didnt have a choice, that I kept saying no, that the man who took my virginity was older, bigger, and stronger than me As embarrassing as my breakdown was, I hoped it would be enough to get him to stop asking questions and just write the damn paper. But no. He kept asking me if he can kiss me, then he started talking about how he only comes to class to see my face and how he cant stop thinking about all the things he wants to do to me. I ran out of there and told him that I was done, that I didnt care if he got a zero on this paper and that I actually hoped he did.

I discovered recently that by duct taping my mouth shut, putting on a sleeping mask, wearing headphones, and then slipping a garbage bag over my head numbs my pain. The feeling of asphyxiation and complete darkness puts me in a strange state of calmness. I usually take off the bag and duct tape when I start having violent spasms. Ive timed and recorded myself before. The spasms usually start after 610 minutes. When I put on the bag, I feel numb. But not painful mental numbness that Ive become far too familiar with. When I dont have the bag on, all my thoughts are negative. I feel like I dont deserve to live, I feel intense feelings of self hatred, I feel really lonely, and I feel urges to hurt myself or kill myself. I also have constant panic attacks. When I put on the bag, my mind clears and Im in a strange betweenawakeandasleep feeling. It just feels good. I realize now that Im becoming addicted to this sensation. I do it every time Im alone. I recognize that I need help, but In a strange way I dont desire to get better. Everyone feels sad. Not being sad would just be fake. Whats the meaning of living without pain?

I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, it is something that started years ago for me. I went through an experience that I didnt think was traumatic at the time but over time became the focus of my anxiety. I was able to live a pretty normal life though, but suddenly this year it began to seep into my day to day life and activities. Dont know what caused it but it scared me, enough that I finally decided to do something about it and so I began the journey of learning about anxiety and how to truly address it. I have found many good resources over the last several months that have really helped me to understand anxiety a bit better and to develop a plan for tackling it. As many resources suggest I am choosing to face my anxiety which entails exposing myself to anxiety inducing thingsplacesevents and sitting with and through the discomfort. I did not understand what it meant to sit with the discomfort, I understood the words but I just didnt know how it would actually work. I tried it anyway and slowly but surely I think I kinda got it, but I wasnt sure. I still couldnt explain it or conceptualize it. Then it came to me while trying to explain to my wife and I think it may be helpful for others. Think about a time you ate something spicy, remember how it slowly build up until your mouth felt like it was on fire. Remember that no matter how much water you drank it provided little relief. All you could do was pant and sit there wishing it stop. It was uncomfortable. But soon it enough you felt it subside, still burned but definitely peaked and was coming down. Eventually you would just go back to normal. Now the next time you eat something spicy you know what feeling awaits you. If you are like me you kept eating spicy and eventually you built a tolerance. You still felt the tingling in your mouth but now you kinda enjoy it. Food didnt taste the same without it. The feeling of anxiety can be overwhelming but it just that, a feeling, just like when your mouth is on fire. You sit with it letting it burn but it will peak and will begin to subside. Its terribly uncomfortable but again just a feeling. I have noticed an improvement since I started this plan of exposure. What helped me too was realizing that the world was feeding me spicy food metaphorically regardless if I wanted it or not, so I decided that if I was going to eat spicy that I better learn how to use it to my advantage and learn to sit with it to build my tolerance. Hope this helps someone make sense of what it means to sit with anxiety like it did me. EDIT If it was not clear, the spicy food reference is an examplemetaphor for understanding what sitting with anxiety can feel like in terms of emtions, feelings, and sensations. Eating spicy food will not help cure anxiety nor have I ever seen any scientific source say as such.",

Im on humor stabilizer medication since the beginning of the year growing now to 300mg. Anyway, I dont know if its normal or not, but my mood swings are quite drastic and quick and Im feeling hopeless and overwhelmed. I spend my days alone because I dont have a lot of friends and I keep canceling plans anyway. I feel like nobody understands me, and I think sometimes I even sabotage my relationships because Im afraid deep down they will leave me anyway at some point. I think Im too much for them. Like a burden. I hate complaining or saying this stuff, but it is true to my heart. I just wanted to know your experience, if you think maybe my medication is not working or if it is normal to have these mood swings after a few months and growing medication? Is it still a process? I mean, sometimes Im good but there are days where I my thoughts are very dark and suicidal. Im feeling desperate, I have health issues now because when I feel low I find refuge on fast food, and now that I have to change my food routine, its freaking me out too, because if that changes too, what pleasure will I have if I keep feeling like shit? What refuge or little pleasure will I find to cope? Its a rollercoaster and I feel like I cant get out of it and just rest. I feel alone, solitude sucks man, it really sucks. Its been years I feel like this, now it gets worse and I dont even know if its related to my medication, maybe Im just overthinking it? Sometimes I think Im not bipolar, I dont know why. Im afraid medication is turning me into this, its been a rough year. Im sorry, its a lot, I just needed to write it out. Either way, I read your messages and it feels good to feel less alone.

Its really hard for me to feel so completely alone its happened multiple times in my life and its gotten to a point where I feel so over it like why cant I just feel good why do things keep happening? its like an endless loop i keep going through the same things at different points in my life. I want to feel like i can be vulnerable without being scared Im too much but I think maybe thats just how its supposed to be? Im too much and its something people dont want which i dont blame them at all Im probably draining to be around especially for my partner I guess Im writing all of this cause no matter what I do i cant stop thinking bad things or crying and I know the only thing that will make me feel better is talking to the person I need to and getting out of this episode but right now it feels like the end of the world for me which I know is silly. I wish it was easy being human but its not and its hard to find how Im supposed to feel content in life with the problems I have. Theres so much more I could say and ramble about but Im not good with words at all and I feel stupid so yeah.",

I didnt enjoy things like a normal kid, my parents spoiled me, Ive gone on many vacations, Ive been given many opportunities to be great. I love to sing, play tennis. Went to catholic school, was bullied there for about 8 years. I always had 1 friend for a very long time 1015 years I never liked groups. I would say Im attractive, but not skinny rich girl attractive. It dawned on me today that Ive never felt free to be at max happy. I never feel free enough to dance. My parents and I dont have a great relationship. My mother has even said I didnt turn out the way she meant, and guilts me. My dad has mental issues and is a clepto amongst other weird shit. I would say I dont hate my personality, can definitely put on a face to be social. Ive never been happy, but Ive justified that by understanding every emotion is fleeting. Ive read a ton of self help books, love to exercise, be outside. Yet, Im always never a full person, and I can feel that ceiling. As far as therapy goes Ive had multiple in my life, forced and not forced. Tried meds. But I dont want to gain weight, and Ive always convinced myself its better to not take meds. I have isolated the things i do that depression might make do. Push people away, hide, lash out. I know Im loved, and I have wonderful people I love. I hate to work and want to quit every job. Im older now, and not having a career or full education is a large part of my sadness. That typical stuff. But its come to the point where Im so tired of trying to be better and stable. Im lashing out at strangers, which is completely out of character for me. For reference, Idgaf about small talk. I understand why its important to a degree. But again, I am incredibly tired of pretending that I care about a hello from a strangers Another add is I got into a car accident in January and got a hole in my leg basically. It got infected, and I cant even can run like i enjoy doing. And gained weight. Anyway the point of this is to say, I have a new symptom of this after a lifetime of ups and downs and apathy. Which is basically just being mute and staring at a wall. Or just straight up dissociating and not being able to come out of it as easy now. I started this new job, and I dont talk to anyone. If I do, I feel like a robot. Not fitting in with the culture here. I ignore my family. And talk when I feel it seems right to do so, for being a humansake and knowing we need to. And there are times or weeks where I really love to say hi. Ive come to a point where Im worried Ive gone down a hole of just existing and have gotten worse, when I dont feel as bad as I have in the past.",

Honestly not sure if this ok or even a good place to ask this but hoped maybe someone else has done it and knows what youre supposed to do after. I bought a week long pill case thing to fill weekly with my meds and supplements so I dont have to open it all nightly. I made an extra one the night I filled it. So 8 days. Tonight I noticed I had an extra salt pill in my slot so I opened the next one thinking it would be missing. It wasnt but I realized my Fluoxetine wasnt there. Opened the 3 remaining slots and NONE have it. I can only logically assume that the first 4 didnt have it, either. Idk how I messed it up this badly but I guess I skipped that bottle when I filled it and somehow didnt even notice it was missing all this time? Ive been sick all week. I now realize it was actually withdrawal. I know how that feels but guess my brain didnt catch on because I had no reason to be in withdrawal. So I fixed the remaining slots and took one for today but should I take extra to make up for what I missed or does it not work like that? I went through 3 weeks of HELL waiting for this med to kick in. Did I just RESET that?! Or is 4 days not enough for it to totally leave my system? Im worried because the withdrawal was a lot better today. Ill be so mad if I have to do that 3 week bullshit all over again because I messed up filling a pill holder. Ugh",

Flashbacks dont stop, I cant stop thinking about it, and cant find any logical reason for this event to have happened to me Very recently while riding my motorcycle on my way home, using the same route Ive been using almost daily for over 2 years, I had an unhappy encounter with a reckless person with no self control at all. It started at an avenue, traffic was stopped, I was filtering since I was on a motorcycle, and suddenly another person on a motorcycle pops out of nowhere and tries to squeeze between me and a car, but failed because there was not enough space, so I went in front, and noticing the way he was riding, I decided to move quickly to get some distance from him, but he was following me. I was starting to go dangerously fast but I was pretty chill at the moment moving between traffic just enjoying the moment and he was trying hard to keep up, so I weaved my hand to the side for him to pass me or at least try to, but he couldnt. That made him so upset I could never ever imagine how a simple joke or something supposed to be a funny moment could startle someone like that. Moments later, when traffic was less dense, I reduced my speed, not much worried about him, but he caught up and didnt pass me, but rather started kicking my bike to try to make me lose balance and fall. I was like what the hell man? but I didnt say anything. Then I stopped and he stopped next to me looking very angry, and he suddenly starts reaching for a gun. He pulled a gun on me in the middle of the traffic, and I was just looking at him not understanding his reaction, I just said calm down man, Im sorry if I did anything that bothered you Something along those lines I cant remember perfectly as it was super quick and stressful. He pointed the gun at me and even hit me it left a bruise on the side of my chest where he hit me to intimidate. Meanwhile I was trying to not escalate things at all, because at that point I knew I was dealing with a crazy person and even the slightest form of confrontation could lead to me getting shot. I didnt complain about anything, and acted like it wasnt a big deal, just telling him stuff like sorry, my bad although I knew I didnt have to be sorry for anything. He was probably expecting a fight or some sort of panic reaction from me, but since things didnt go like that he couldnt say anything, he only stared at me for some more seconds and told me to leave quickly. I left then and told the police everything.",

Of course I knew what bipolar was at fifteen but I knew everything lol. Lately the past 8 months Ive been in and out of doctors appointments, Im talking all sorts. Without going into much personal detail I dont want sympathy Ive been in chronic pain these 8 months with little relief and no diagnosis yet. I think theyre getting close? I hope. The challenges Im facing of not letting my frustrations out on people who dont deserve it ie doctors I had a bad experience when I was 12 in the hospital for a week or so as well as experiencing some issues imo with standard of care I finally did a few things for myself regarding relationships with other people and it has helped lift some weight I didnt know I had. Ive been by exes therapist for a few years after our splitting ways, we both genuinely cared about each other and kept in touch frequently. If she was ever in a relationship Id never call out of respect for the other guy. All that being said this past week I just didnt want to do it anymore, to me it is so frustrating to watch someone suffer when they dont have to especially when I am doing it practically 247 and would do anything to get back to a different time. I told her how I felt about her abusive bf, how I felt about her, and how she was better than this situation and that she needs to start respecting herself if she wants to stay in touch. Not as a way of getting her back, but as a way of setting a boundary. As I said I cant stand to be around people who subject themselves to pain and suffering. Its a long story and I know abuse is not to be taken lightly often those relationships are the hardest to leave, this being said she has so many people that would drop everything for her to help her get out of this. Theyve not been together to long and I told her time is of the essence the longer she waits the harder it will be. The last thing she said to me prior to me dropping a bomb on her metaphorically cmon guys was NOOOO jk jk she said not to call and just say okay right after we got off the phone and she brought up old times of us being together. Well she didnt say that she had her mom text me that. Also I live states away otherwise Id interject myself Anyways thats the tip of the iceberg. I always tell myself it can get worse to spark a desire to live in the light, and it has consistently so Im glad I had the right mindset. Ways Ive coped For anyone fortunate enough to have a support system theyre neglecting to use, I was in a similar position and broke the chains. Being manic helps that confidence is like no other. I am fortunate enough to be seeing a therapist. I am completely transparent now when it comes to what I will say to my therapist. The truth will set you free. When I stopped lying to myself and started listening it opened doors for my mental health. It has taken years to get to this point to be able to say something good about what Ive done for my mental health. I am speaking for myself here and am not pushing this as treatment, that being said having a relationship with God has helped. Its given me someone to look at and base my actions off of. Helpful to me because I am like a blank slate some days as far as how to function as a human being. Right from wrong, not in a drastic way but my compass is slightly warped. Online support groups regarding the chronic pain specifically I spoke with other people going through similar experiences. Being able to speak freely in the comfort of other people while also using the things youve learned to help others is such a great positive cycle to be a part of. I encourage everyone if they have the confidence to do so that you find a support group for a problem you have and see what it can do for you. On a positive note Ive removed enough of my bad habits to actually be able and enjoy a good one! Im slowly getting into making music and trying my best to fall in love every step of the way. Ive always wanted to but that voice in my head told me it was a waste of time and I shouldnt bother since it wont go anywhere. No more. I hope to continue and be able to see through the veil that is my perception. To anyone currently going through something they cant see themselves getting out of, I promise theres someone who can help you. There is an answer in the right direction out there for you. To anyone who read this far thank you, sorry you cant get that time back. Best of wishes",

The worst part is that I know theyre not real but theyre disturbingly vivid. I dont know what to think of it. My dreams are usually about being raped at his house, the one he was in when my parents divorced. Whether by him, by a friend of his, or by his girlfriend, its always got something to do with him. One time he was the one abusing me. One time he found me in the aftermath and blamed me for it. One time it was his girlfriend. Nothing about these dreams is consistent except sexual violence and him being there. I also remember being terrified of undressing in his house. I didnt feel safe. Getting ready for school was a nightmare and bathing made me sick to my stomach. I dont know what I was so afraid of but I would have anxiety attacks about it. There are a few odd memories that stand out too. He once spanked me, pants and underwear down, as punishment for something when I was little. Another time I was undressed for a bath crying because I was so upset while he was watching me to make sure I actually bathed. He never abused me though. I think these dreams are just the wires crossing in my head between my sexual abuse unrelated to my parents and the feelings of abandonment from him leaving? Im not sure, but it scares me",
        "output": "Based on your text, you're likely experiencing symptoms consistent with PTSD related to childhood experiences and potential trauma. The vivid, disturbing dreams centered around your father's house and sexual violence are particularly concerning. While you believe your father didn't abuse you, the anxiety around undressing, the spanking incident, and being watched while bathing suggest potential boundary violations and emotional distress. It is possible you've repressed more. Consulting a therapist specializing in trauma is crucial for assessment and support.\n\n**Ryff Scale Insights:**\n\n*   **Autonomy:** Practice assertive communication.\n*   **Env.

I have written an overall part at the bottom and my precise ask if you feel like a lighter read. Super, SUPER, quick overview I am 21m I smoke weed nightly For the health conditions below, and to allow for some sleep Sleep medication is not an option for me, I have addiction issues and dont want to risk it again. I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Depression and PTSD. All unmedicated, not by choice, but rather I cannot afford the psychiatrist appointments, and I live in a country where there isnt any sort of beneficiary payment that covers psychiatrists. 3 major traumatic life events in the last two years, all three of which were closetodeadly circumstances revolving around wars, wars again, and depression. My family, along with myself in some places, are fairly well known. There is no such thing as privacy for us, im being told by strangers about my life events before ive even really taken them in myself. Yet none of them know any depth to these events so no one even knows that what I really need is just a tiny bit of support. or help. I dont know what I need to be honest. If its a reality check, give me it, and tell me as harshly as possible. Ive had some major costs come up due to illnesses and other sort of personalfamily issues, which has lead to my oncegood savings being drained into the negatives. A bit more context 1. I am a university student, struggling with my course load 3 degrees, but it genuinely is the only thing keeping me going and there is no way on earth I will withdrawpostpone a single paper. I have nothing without this. 2. I have struggled to make friends my entire life, usually having one or two actual friends at a time, with a couple that have stayed but really noone else. 3. This year I moved into my flat and made really good friends with one of my flatmates. Great friends, super close. 4. This friend is leaving for a while, and that is extremely scary in itself for me as I really struggle, as I said, to make friends. 5. Im doing ok? at the moment, at least im not at the depths of any sort of depressive episode or whatnot. 6. Everyday however, I have at least an hour long hysterical crying fit that i just cant control. I get so very overwhelmed to the point of a breakdown, everyday, for months. This is what doing ok is to me. Outside of this hour, I feel this constant threat that something bad will happen, but not like an earthquake or something, but more so something along the lines of losing all of my friends, losing my parttime job, losing my motivation which is near none anyway, etc etc. I constantly am in fight or flight mode, but ive said that for years, but now I think I truly am at my limit of this mode. I genuinely feel more scared, tense, sad, and angry, right this moment, even just while writing this, than i did when I had a gun at my head last year. How does that even work? possible signs of anxiety? 7. I get EXTREME FOMO, and simply get very jealous if my friends make plans without me my friends have plans I cannot attend. Hence why im writing this, my friends are going out for a couple hours, but I have to head into work very soon, and im here hyperventilating, crying, and feeling so so silly. 8. I constantly, without a break, feel like every one of my friendships and all relationships really are hanging on by the thinest thread. I cant break this feeling no matter what. I have had those stonedtonearnonverbal conversations with my closest flatmate where we both have expressed our appreciation for each other. I have had those illicit substance fulled I LOVE YOU BRO moments that last hours as we are just able to hang there until sober with the same feelings. Same with other friends too. Ive had the Hey, I usually dont say this when im sober but I am so glad we became friends. Yet even after all of this, I cannot shake the feeling that all of this is only a fracture away from complete dissolution. Overall I feel like im about to loose everything, constantly. I feel like all my friendships are only due to proximity, and that the moment this proximity widens, everything will disappear. I feel like im constantly fighting to get a break, and no matter how hard i fight, i will lose. I pull myself together, fight again lose again. repeat. I just feel stuck in this loop of wanting to scream FUCK THIS at literally every single minor thing. I hate it. I want to be just a kind, hard working, relatively happy, normal person. I have A LOT more detail that would make this so much more understandable however I know this post is too long already. I know I have been through a fair amount of shit. I dont need to be told that I should give myself a break or anything similar, I get I could, and I have, but its too constant to be continuous chasing a break that never really happens. And again to reiterate, I cant afford mental health assistance. Any advice or similar situations that lead to any sort of breakthrough. And again, if im just in need of a reality check, drill it into me. I dont care if its the harshest thing you have said to someone i just need to know what i need to do to stop being so fucking stuck.",

I have tried various therapies and medications but never managed to find a good fit. My partner and I have been together for 7 years but he has now reached his breaking point. I dont think either of us realised how bad things had gotten. He is such a kind, loving soul and has always done everything in his power to support me and minimise the impacts of my anxiety. It has become routine for him to handle all of the day to day things I struggle with phone calls, life admin, appointments, driving etc. I know he is constantly thinking of my triggers when we are in public and tries to avoid them. In the past year or so it has become worse and I no longer go out to social occasions with him or have friends of my own. If Im honest, and Im ashamed to admit this, he has become my whole world and I know it puts a lot of pressure on him. I have recently had a bad spell and been signed off work for a month. He no longer sees our relationship being sustainable and I completely understand. I am so desperate to change and we have talked at length about what would need to happen going forward for us to be together. My self confidence is so low and Im scared I wont be able to. Has anyone been in similar positions to this and managed to improve things? I dont want to be the way I am at the moment I feel like a shell of myself. I am looking into private therapy, medication, reaching out to old friends, and Ive been honest with my family about what is going on to try and build my support network.

I was an apprentice plumber, Im extremely tough and Im as tough as they come Im not boasting, its fact I was unbreakable, the company, 1 boss, 1 apprentice, company pays late all the time, boss was a narcissist, the anger the shouting all that jazz, paid annual leave 3 weeks after NYE THE FUIG DOG. Didnt bother me, I was good until 2022, caught by police unregistered work van 3rd time caught over a 5 month span THIS is when I mentally SNAPPED or soul left body, I used the van to go tafe for exams that day, that day I became an alcoholic, did too much for someone and left myself to shit like a slave. Overworked and redlining, as in instead of working optimal like average society just turn up to work and go home do 9 to 5 where its somewhat pleasing, chat with coworkers, bludge a bit, pull sickies, not to worry much kinda things, proper company rules regarding employee saftey and treatement, no abusive behaviour, everyone respectfully monitored but my position? Throw all that shit out the window this place required operating over the maximum capacity everyday, I was born for this but cmon EVERYDAY! well super rare to get chill days this is long story short. I printed 400 pages of bank statements, THEREFORE required to highlight wages paid as there were no payslips company did not do group certificates, and instead of just high lighting the wages I went further resurfacing and writing down small entries I remember in a journal when seeing the dates and leaving notes on the bank statements, I found means to go through photos, messages, spending 5 hours on separate days apart through a 4 week period, marking days of traumawhat happened on normal days, I have successfully conjured the state that was in the past as of 25 OCT 2024. That meant I was sober for 5 months and I have decided to intentionally drink just to feel more of that old pain so I could write what that old self was feeling. Bringing my old self back who I tried killing. If Ive come this far why turn back? Before you all say its a mistake, you must believe these following words I am in control of this, I am powerful, its just that this particular suffering that I spent a year forgetting never disappeared, everything Ive overcame is not on any scale, my instinct leads me knowing Im ready to face my past and learn My tax is almost done 10 left. It was tough going through it and doing all this can be reused for another purpose like super insurance claims and workers comp documentation. Making a claim was never my intention but it seems as Im doing my tax, it appears as though my notes reliving the past serve an extra purpose. FYI I stopped work July 19 2024 due to being diagnosed with AVN avascular necrosis. I cannot work like normal again. Hip needs surgery and Im 33.

Ive made some progress here and there, but it always feels like something knocks me back, and I end up feeling stuck. A little about me Im 24 and have struggled with anxiety since I was younger. Its made daily things like leaving the house or talking to people tough. Ive been working on it, but the progress doesnt always stick, and its discouraging to feel like Im back at square one after every setback. I live on my own and rely on HelloFresh and Amazon for food and essentials since I cant go to the store. My family is nearby, but I feel like Im a bit of a burden to them. Theyve been supportive, but I worry theyve given up after so many years of me being stuck in this cycle. 3D modeling is something I really enjoy, and Ive even sold 3D assets before and done some 2D art commissions, but confidence is a huge barrier for me. I struggle with promoting my services and setting fair prices, which makes it harder to make consistent money or grow. I love the work I do, but my anxiety makes it hard to stay motivated and to know where to start when it comes to marketing myself or finding new clients. What Im looking for is advice on how to move forward. I dont know how to get a job or build qualifications, especially since I dont have the money for courses. I also want to find a way to make enough money to stop relying on government aid, but Im not sure how to break through. I just feel a bit aimless sometimes, especially with the anxiety holding me back from pushing myself forward. What has helped you guys get through your anxiety? If anyone has advice on overcoming this confidence struggle, or how to take small steps toward being more independent both financially and emotionally, Id really appreciate it. I just want to find a way to make progress and build something for myself, even if its slow. Thanks for reading.",

He is also troubling her parents with this and everything is leading it to a lot of pressure on her, also she moved to a different city where we met and she lives here with her Uncle and Aunt who are also very toxic.

Everytime she threatens to leave she does this by not coming home from work and staying at a friends house a couple days to a week to think things over it sets my triggers off like you wouldnt believe, feelings of worthlessness, abandonment, and fear i will lose my best friend if i cant change fast enough. This triggers even more flashbacks and makes sleeping or work even harder. I just discovered 2 years ago I REALLY need stability in my life and these events really throw everything off balance.

        "input": "Life is nothing but a lie Around january 2023 I started feeling slowly but steadily down. By that time I had been sober alcohol, used to be a train wreck for a year and some, had gotten my shit together in uni and was actually doing a shit ton of courses per semester and passing them all with stunning grades. Was working a job that I really enjoyed and was somewhat related to my career. I had a shit ton of friends and felt so very loved by them all, I was filled with gratitude . By that point january 2023 Id also been in a relationship for like a year and although it was a very toxic one and he ended up being a vile man, to me being in a relationship felt almost surreal since I had never been in one before, not once in my life, and I am in my mid twenties. Over all, I was doing good. So good. So fucking good it felt a little bit like a dream. I thought sobriety was responsible for my achieving all of this stuff in only a bit over a year. Prior to all this, I was a living hell a raging alcoholic, unable to work, useless at uni, with two attempts on my back and a long history of sh. It was a nightmare. I of course knew I was going through the longest depressive episode of my life, but after all of this improvement I was certain that things had magically gotten amazing the moment I stopped drinking and went 100 sober and that alcohol mustve been the cause for all of the stuff that I had to go through before. It had never occurred to me that there surely mustve been a reason for me to finally stop drinking out of the blue, almost no effort at all, after so so many failed attempts. Turns out it was all just a manic episode. All of it. All of the good things, the extraordinary things, the stuff that people wouldve never believed I was capable of had they not been there as witnesses. And then january. It all started with a sudden habit of overreacting towards minor issues. Feeling a little bit off. Kinda sad. You know, it happens to all us. Next thing I know, in only a matter of weeks, I was on a mental health leave from work, unable to communicate, alienated at home all day long doing nothing but uncontrollably sobbing and feeling as if the world had ended for no fucking reason at all. Soon after that I started drinking again. Then came november 2023. Got better. Again. A new job, one that I am absolutely in love with. Broke up with the guy and realized how damaging the relationship actually was. Kept on going with my career, as good or better than before the downfall, and this last march even started a second one that I also excell at academia is very important to me. Friends. Social outings every weekend. Flirty but cautious, just having fun. I could drink like any other human being out there and had no issues with self control. And then, couple months ago, I felt it again. Almost down to a T. It all repeated itself. All of it. I once again find myself on a mental health leave, barely managing with the few courses I didnt drop this semester and absolutely fucking hopeless. Last week I spent the entirety of my savings on alcohol and shit. I am so tired. Its all a lie. The life that one builds for oneself. Doesnt matter what you do, how good ir gets theyre all the city of Troy and will inevitable burn to the ground, its only a matter of time. I just wanted to rant for a bit. Tonights being rough, although I gotta say Im managing it way better than how I did back in 2023, let alone years before that.",

I go through long and severe phases as Im sure many of you do of depressive episodes, characterised by my lack of showering, brushing teeth, doing laundry, cleaning my room, leaving the house, eating, etc. However. Id say Im reasonably committed to my own general improvement I try to create routines, I do therapy once a week for years now, Im medicated, I stay away from drugs and alcohol for the most part, and I generally try to do things that will serve me and help my mental health, whenever I can whenever Im not severely depressed. One day, though, I want to have kids ideally at least 4, but well see when we get there. Ive thought about the fact that my kids are going to be at a higher risk for developing bipolar because of my diagnosis, but I always thought that if they ever did, I would be really good at supporting them and I think its obviously not worth not having kids at all in my opinion. But my question is this how on earth do people who struggle with bipolar the way I do especially the depression manage to keep their kids healthy and happy when they cant always do that for themselves? How am I meant to feed my kids several times a day when I sometimes cant even get out of bed? How do I keep the house running smoothly when I currently cant even keep up with my own bedroom and laundry? It might be a stupid question, but Im really interested in seeing what any of you bipolar parents maybe mothers specifically, because Im a woman have to say about the struggles of being a bipolar parent. Like, the way my life is now, considering my capabilities and limitations, I dont see how it would work that well for me. TLDR What are the struggles you face as a bipolar parent?

Lately the past 8 months Ive been in and out of doctors appointments, Im talking all sorts. Without going into much personal detail I dont want sympathy Ive been in widespread chronic pain these past 8 months with little relief and no diagnosis yet. I think theyre getting close? I hope. The challenges Im facing of not letting my frustrations out on people who dont deserve it ie doctors I had a bad experience when I was 12 in the hospital for a week or so as well as experiencing some issues with standard of care currently imo I finally did a few things for myself regarding relationships with other people and it has helped lift some weight I didnt know I had. I always give away my happiness. Ive been by exes therapist for a few years after our splitting ways, we both genuinely cared about each other and kept in touch frequently. I just didnt want to do it anymore, to me it is so frustrating to watch someone suffer when they dont have to especially when I am doing it practically 247 and would do anything to get back to a different time. I told her how I felt about her abusive bf, how I felt about her still have feelings and how she was better than this situation and that she needs to start respecting herself if she wants to stay in touch. Not as a way of getting her back, but as a way of setting a boundary. Her and I are much alike in our perfectionism and unwillingness to let others settle for less. Its a long story and maybe Im the asshoke.. Theyve not been together to long and I told her time is of the essence the longer she waits the harder it will be. The last thing she said to me right after we got off the phone was a text from her Mom saying not to call her back we joked about me calling her back and pretending to be a different guy I realized I dont want to be on talk with limitations anymore. Anyways thats the tip of the iceberg. I always tell myself it can get worse to spark a desire to live in the light, and it has consistently so Im glad I had the right mindset. Ways Ive coped For anyone fortunate enough to have a support system theyre neglecting to use, I was in a similar position and broke the chains. Being manic helps that confidence is like no other. I am fortunate enough to be seeing a therapist. I am completely transparent now when it comes to what I will say to my therapist. The truth will set you free. When I stopped lying to myself and started listening it opened doors for my mental health. It has taken years to get to this point to be able to say something good about what Ive done for my mental health. I am speaking for myself here and am not pushing this as treatment, that being said having a relationship with God has helped. Its given me someone to look at and base my actions off of. Helpful to me because I am like a blank slate some days as far as how to function as a human being. How to just be.

When will i see the light at the end, is there even a light at the end. everything i keep reading says it gets worse as you age and here i am at 31 just getting diagnosed and looking back i can see that i have been dealing with this since i was 11 and i didnt have help no one knew i didnt even know i just found ways to work around it and make situations work for me or found ways to avoid them if i knew i couldnt make it work. I hold myself to such a high standard i wonder does this diagnoses even matter i have been pushing through it for this long whats the rest of my life anyways really if i can make it this long i can make it to the end right? maybe its not real maybe i am just saying all the right buzz words regurgitating them back like a parrot and making everyone else believe that i am bipolar but what if i am not and im just fooling everyone around me. i still dont even understand what this means bipolar 2 i have googled and read a millions posts that all seem like stories of my own and it almost convinced me maybe they are right maybe this is the answer and maybe the end is in sight and i can be normal. thats all i have ever wanted was to be normal thats why i work so hard to pretend and be the person everyone expects i put on the mask and everything is ok. i just want to be normal is that ever going to happen and if it does am i going to miss myself like so many others i have seen post? im sorry i just had to share with someone anyone really i dont know if i want answers or not but just writing this out has made me feel better. Please share with me how you felt when you found out, i would love to hear how others have coped with this and maybe i can find some peace in responses.",

He asks about my sleep I say I havent been sleeping as much, but mostly just because I am overwhelmed by parenting and want to have some quiet me time at the end of the day.

Im just surprised hes not concerned by someone who is describing a decreased need for sleep. I was surprised too because were always taught how important medication adherence is with this illness, yet my psychiatrist was seemingly unconcerned by me skipping doses here and there.

It sort of helped cuz I have had different experiences, but I still havent had any experiences you know positively with anything close to ummm my trauma .. So now Im a 26 year old virgin who is also damaged and just fml. It didnt help that this guy pretty much said I should be with someone n deserve someone who can handle my PTSD .

I did things I now regret like whatever its fine I liked him, but I just feel used . He said from the beginning he wanted causal but then he knew about my SA trauma . He knew n he I guess assumed itd be okay cuz Im slutty. Then I guess later felt bad about it. Whatever. Anyway, I cant seem to see sexual normally so I dont think hooking up especially casually is a very good idea. Like I have triggers and literally any mention of sex I just think of my SA. Its the only reference I have unfortunately.. It helped a bit like I said but it definitely didnt like get rid of the pain Im feeling. It just made it worse because now I just did these things to make myself like feel anything else and to lower the value of what was stolen from me. He didnt exactly take my virginity . He just SA me over my clothes, so I feel dramatic being this upset about it, but the way I see it that was my first experience. No he didnt take that he didnt have actual like PIV sex with me, but my first experience was literally assault and traumatizing. Im just not okay right now. And Im realizing I became like attached to my rapist after I even kept dating him, because idk I thought it was my fault for not being ready. For not meeting his needs. Help. I feel so crazy like why is this so traumatizing ? Will I ever feel better and heal from this ? I feel guilty too even wanting a normal sex life after that even wanting something that was so traumatic for me that was so disgustingly like. forced so now I feel guilty that Im even curious to know what normal sex is like. Im just so depressed. How do I heal from this? And please dont tell me to get therapy . I cant get therapy yet. And what he did wasnt even rape ! It wasnt even forcing actual sex.

Context I have preexisting childhood trauma that really affects my self worth and confidence that Im not going to go into here, but the full story is in another post I made if anybody wants to see. Im a Medic in the Royal Navy, I fucking love my job, and without wanting to big myself up Im pretty good at it. I 25m live with my girlfriend 23f of two years, and lately Ive been struggling a lot. Of the two of us she is definitely the smarter, shes got her shit together. Meanwhile Im waiting on an ADHD referral Sometimes I do dumb shit or just dont think of things. The result is that I feel like Im under scrutiny all the time, because I feel like she dont respect me or trust me. Theres times I feel micromanaged and its very disheartening. Ill admit I do dumb shit sometimes, but the problem is that if Im under scrutiny, I overthink. When I overthink I make mistakes and its a repeating cycle and a self fulfilling prophecy I dont know how to resolve this because I cant expect her to just suddenly trust me, but I do want her to not automatically assume that Im being an idiot. Its really depressing because I know Im no more of an idiot than the next man but then I feel like Im useless Its not just that either, one thing thats been causing a big problem is the fact that my hearing isnt great. Its got not much to do with actual hearing as it does with ADHD. When I discussed it with my doctor we discussed the possibility that I might have auditory processing disorder which is part of ADHD where you can have good hearing but if you have background noise, youre concentrating on something, or anything else that could distract you you just dont hear other things. We went bowling tonight and the music was very loud but she would talk at a normal level, so I didnt have a hope of hearing and kept asking her to repeat herself so she stopped bothering to talk to me at all so we ended up bowling in all but silence and it was utterly crushing Its really hard because we both love each other so much but she just doesnt respect me and Im really struggling to work out how to address this with her",

This was the third date, but we had talked on the phone thats it though 3 months. I told him I never did anything sexually Im a virgin basically a good girl for lack of better words. And I was raised like that sex should be if Im in love or preferably I should be married. At least I should know the guy really well. Besides that I wasnt comfortable with sex. I wasnt taught much about it. I was taught it was bad pretty much and I didnt know it was even normal for women to have urges ? So you get how I felt about it mentally emotionally. Though I did think from the beginning wow I feel like eventually I will have to because he was pressuring me, but too subtly for me to think much of it.. but whenever he brought it up I got uncomfortable like our second date and he said Id never pressure you or anything and you wouldnt do it out of guilt right? Then he just said hey I really like you. Anyway I only knew him in person for three days before he sexually assaulted me. It was our first day literally first day of dating. So heres what happened we were in his car as he pulled into the driveway to his house. I kept saying Im looking for somewhere to go and he just ignored me. He suggested we go back inside his house and hang out. Stupidly I believed him. He also casually says oh hey my Uncles here. I dont go inside at first but eventually I do and thinking were gonna hang out. So at first we were just kissing . but then he started I guess grinding on me ? I didnt know what it was even called at the time or I mightve just left, but I didnt think much of it at the time and he seemed nice enough. And I got really nervous. I said I had to go to the bathroom then went back like nah he doesnt realize so I just have to tell him. So I tell him Im really nervous I need to breathe. I do want to kiss you though. So he goes back to kissing me but how hes doing it is more. Intense so I have a panic attack . Eventually he pulled away and just went and sat on the other side of his bed ignoring me. He just completely ignored me he wouldnt even look at me. I kept trying to tell him I was nervous again like I said. He sighs really loudly and like an idiot I ask what ? Whats wrong ? Then he doesnt say anything again and just sighs irritated. Nervously I ask what ? What do you want ? He then gets in my face and says I WANT you. Empasizing the want Then whispers to stop in MY EAR and goes back to kissing me even though I wasnt and gets ontop of me again trying to kiss my neck. His Uncle walks in and asks if Im okay because were kissing but hes touching me groping me actually grabbing my boobs my ass and Im literally doing nothing back but kissing him. Im embarrassed and my face is getting red cuz I feel embarrassed about that so I say Im okay and then he leaves and talks to his uncle Then he comes back and says Now.. where were we ? And I dont like how he says it but I feel insecure and I keep thinking maybe I should just touch him back like he wants even though its because he said he wanted me to stop sarcastically and even threateningly so at first I do. Then he tries grinding on me again and I completely pull away and stop kissing him I stop like everything. Im just looking down at what he tried to do again and Im in shock. I wanted to say something but the way he said stop was so aggressive and it made me feel guilty and afraid, but again I just kept telling myself its fine Im overthinking it hes nice. Then he looks down also looks at me sighs and then grabs me and kisses me I dont know what to do. I dont really think I need to scream and Im getting afraid cuz Im not grabbing him back, but either way hes kissing me so aggressively not moving away from my face that I do back just because hes freaking me out and I dont want to offend him. So I think maybe if I dont put my hands on him. So I dont . The weird thing is idk maybe Im overthinking it but he had grabbed and just kissed me before too and in his room, so why would I think the situation would get dangerous? Then he just gets on my legs with his knees and I cant move. We still have our clothes on. He just literally sits on my legs with his knees and I cant move. I think does he realize hes crushing my legs. I wanna scream but I just freeze. I cant move. I dont care what anyone says idk how to describe it but simulating rough sex except I didnt consent so it simulated something different almost for me that seems more accurate than saying it was dry humping because thats when two people are doing it. This was not that. To me it was just violating and abuse. I mean I couldnt move I didnt move once. At all. Then he proceeds to aggressively hump me until he finishes all while I can not move tonic immobility like freezing in fear cuz of him getting on my legs and I dissacociated but it was HOW he did it he seemed mad at me and he was aggressive. And it was kind of roughly. how he did it though thankfully wasnt injured not to that point. He made me feel his groin area.. many times. Through the clothing. He forced my body to react then just finished. But after a long ass time n mind you I was HELD DOWN during this. He even TOOK BREAKS. And he kept getting ontop of me while he did this. It was terrifying I tried like if I just look away never look at him maybe hell stop. He didnt. Even though it was aggressive dry humping I mean I was dissacociated and I froze and it sounded wrong so to be completely honest to ME from MY perspective at first I thought oh god it sounds like Im being raped and it did because he was roughly doing it without my consent and it didnt sound right. It literally sounded forced, but my mind just went somewhere else though I partly had awareness of what was going on. And it took time to even figure out what was going on because I had never done anything at all sexually, so I was really scared. Emotionally though I just felt dead inside empty. I felt like a fucking toy and he was using my body to you know. And I was just there frozen unable to move. I know he didnt rape me or anything n Im grateful it was at least over our clothes but heres the thing I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING I HAD NO SEXUAL EXPERIENCE and IM A VIRGIN so to me it was horrifyingly close to something else or am I being dramatic ? I know its not even actual sex. Im traumatized though. It still gave me PTSD. And some fucking weird kinks and affected my sexuality amongst other issues.. .. I should mention honestly I wasnt ready at all. I could see myself having been ready like 20s like early 20s . I was 19 at the time. It really hurts this being my first experience. Plus it makes dating just a nightmare. Especially being a bit promiscuous after this for a while just to make myself feel better like the more experienced I am, the less this matters. That isnt helping though so now I just probably need therapy first before I do anything related cuz it just reminds me of my assault..",

For a long time, I knew something wasnt right inside me, but I couldnt put my finger on it. It wasnt until I went to therapy and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 19 that it started to make sense. Now, at 23, I can see how each of my three relationships was really a way to distract myself from the chaos in my mind. Ive been carrying the weight of sexual trauma, too, which has made me hypersexual. When I look back, I realize I didnt genuinely love any of themI was just convincing myself that I did, maybe because I was so scared of being alone or facing my own pain. Each relationship turned toxic, one after the other. I know I had a part in it. I forced myself to believe they were everything, that I loved them, and I depended on them so heavily that it was like I couldnt breathe without them. Every day, my mood and selfworth revolved around them. And then, when things ended, it felt like my whole world shattered. Id be left sleepless, unable to eat, and begging to be taken back, calling them constantly because I couldnt bear the emptiness. Looking back now, I see it wasnt loveit was this unhealthy, allconsuming obsession, fueled by this desperate need to feel close to someone, anyone. Right now, it feels unbearable. I just got out of another relationship a month ago, and even though I chased him and poured so much into it, now I hate him, and I hate myself for even being with him. The regret is overwhelming. I feel like I dont even know what real love is, like maybe Im just broken inside, doomed to keep repeating this painful cycle. I dont know whats wrong with me, but this disorder is tearing me apart. Does anyone feel this way ? Its like meeting someone and they quickly become your whole world. You get so attached, so wrapped up in them that every part of who they are feels perfect, like they were meant for you. The obsession runs deepyou love every detail, every moment, and it feels like you couldnt live without them. But the second they hurt you, its like a switch flips. Suddenly, everything you once adored about them turns into something you resent. That connection that felt so intense turns painful, and all those little things you loved now just remind you of the hurt. Its a cycle of extreme highs and lows, where love feels allconsuming one minute, and then the next, youre filled with anger and regret. Its such a confusing and exhausting way to love because every moment feels like everythinguntil it doesnt. Its like everything felt so real, but looking back, it was all built on lust and attraction. The connection felt intense, almost overwhelming, but maybe it was just the rush, the thrill, and not a deeper bond. I think I was seeing something that wasnt really therejust creating a version of them in my mind that I wanted to believe in. Maybe I was just caught up, delusional, and manic, swept away in the high of it all. Then, when it was over, its like the illusion fell apart, leaving me with nothing but the emptiness. Its as if my whole world shatters each time, and Im left wondering if any of it was ever real or if I was just trying to fill a void.",

It made me very sick, like to the point where I was shaking, drenched in sweat, diarrhea, and having panic attacks. I was also feeling very depressed and suicidal. I almost called an ambulance but was able to make it to the hospital on my own. My dr switched my medication and today the same thing happened. I had to stop working because I felt the same symptoms and started dry heaving until I took a sip of water and threw up. I checked my bp using the machine in the break room and it was 14281 and my heart rate was 112, so I left and went to urgent treatment. Now Im contemplating on if I should go to psychiatric in patient or not. Im to the point where Im terrified of taking another new antidepressant. I also cant keep leaving work early because of a reaction to my medication. Personally I would like to take an fmla leave until I can get my medication figured out, however Im not qualified because I havent been at my current job for 12 months. I feel like going in patient would be good because they could try different medications and Id be somewhere safe if something were to happen again. Its also an excused absence from work. However, I feel like mentally Im just not at a point where I feel like Im a threat to myself or others. Most of the time I feel fine still depressed but overall fine mentally, but its when Im having severe reactions to my medication that I feel like I want to die.

All the equipment was in great shape, my manager kept everything sparkly clean, and I was working with two older women, who I got along with pretty well. One of them had some kind of learning disability and she and I clicked on a way I didnt with the rest of the staff. Well, a few months ago my manager left for her vacation which she had been planning for six months and she was out of the country. Both my coworkers quit the week before her vacation and she had to bring an ex employee back who was an older man, very backwoods blue collar guy who definitely makes an effort to be positive and he is nice to me, but hes a lot more easily stressed by the lunch rush and sometimes he goes on really bigoted rants out of nowhere. So my manager left for vacation and it was just me and him alone together for nine days straight. During that week, the hurricanes hit the area were at pretty hard and we lost running water for three days. His cousin died in the flood. We both continued to show up for work but I could tell he was losing his grip and one day he went off and started screaming at one of the nurses. I started binging weed just to get through everything and when my manager got back, she seemed totally clueless about the kind of hell wed been through and asked me about my new girlfriend and I had to remind her that I hadnt seen her at all in two weeks because I was locked away in that building. My manager gave me an extra day off that week to recooperate but ever since then I just hate my job. I dont wanna look at that kitchen anymore. My girlfriend left me and Ive been a depressed anxious wreck. I got put on SSRIs this week, and Im getting better but I still fucking hate my job. I felt this way about my old job after Covid hit and screwed everything up and I was there for four years. Its like I associate it forever now with that one really bad week and it feels like every time I clock in Im reliving it all over again.

Yesterday, I opened up about having Bipolar letting them know how I process my emotions, why its important to me that someone I date knows this and understands what bipolar is my last partner thought bipolar and BPD were the same thing and they were a psychology major, and also asked them to think about this to reflect on whether or not they want to date someone with bipolar. Theyve been so receptive and empathetic to this point, so I was expecting a comforting reaction. As assumptions tend to be, that was a bit off course. Instead, they told me about how they have always had fears of going crazy their words, not mine and have anxiety around the thought of getting locked up. They dont suffer from any severe mental illness, so I guess this comes from a combination of societal messages and the fear around existential thinking. ANYWAYS, they further went on to say that they could not be a person to support someone in a manic state of mind, basically. I wasnt expecting that, I am very independent and try to seek my main support through my therapist and safety network Ive built, but Im worried that this person will be afraid of me if I do ever have a manic episode while dating. Is this person safe to date? what do you look in a partner to be supportive of you?",

For those who dont know, bipolar disorder isnt just mood swings. Its an overwhelming cycle of highs and lows. The manic episodes can make you feel invincible, like you can conquer the world in a single daybut its also the time you make impulsive decisions that can wreak havoc on your life. And then theres the crash the depressive episodes where getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain. Whats worse? Trying to explain this to people who dont understand. Theyll say, We all have bad days, or Just think positive! As if bipolar depression is the same as being in a bad mood. Spoiler its not. And lets talk about the fear of judgment. It feels like society has slapped a giant label on me that says unstable. Employers hesitate, friends drift away, and even family members dont always understand. This is why so many people with bipolar disorder suffer in silence. I wish people knew that having bipolar disorder symptoms doesnt make us broken or less deserving of love, understanding, and opportunities.

Sometimes I wonder if people really understand how exhausting it is to live with bipolar disorder and the constant battle with mood swings. Its like being at war with myselfone minute, Im high on life, feeling unstoppable, and the next, Im drowning in sadness, struggling to just exist. I know Im not alone in this, but it still feels like no one truly gets how hard it is to manage these daily fluctuations. The worst part? The unpredictability. I never know when the high will crash, or when the depressive wave will hit. And when it does, it feels like a tidal wave that pulls me under. One quote that really resonates with me is by Stephen Fry, who once said, I am not afraid of being depressed. I am afraid of being happy, because I know that one day the happiness will be gone. It feels like Im always bracing for the other shoe to drop. And then theres the guilt. Every time Im up, I feel like Im too much, like Im pushing people away with my energy and enthusiasm. When Im down, I feel like Im too little, like Im not giving enough to those around me. Its like Im never just enough in my own skin. Sometimes, the emotional swings feel like theyre out of my control, but I try to remind myself of a powerful quote from Maya Angelou We may encounter many defeats, but we must not be defeated. I have to keep reminding myself that these mood swings dont define me. Its exhausting, but I know Im not alone in this battle.

When Im well, I have oomph for talking, whereas when Im unwell, the thought of ordering coffee is completely overwhelming. The opposite is true with writing. When I am unwell, words drip from my fingertips, but when life trots along nicely, I dry up. So here I am, all dried up. And thats good news. Right? Im so well I have nothing to say. My mood has become extremely stable in recent months, which is apparently an aim of recovery in bipolar II disorderhttpswww.amazon.comdpB09HG2GKM6. No big highs. No big lows. But the other thing that happens without highs and lows is mood becomes very flat. And that, I do not like. Mood fluctuation is a normal part of the human experience and isnt necessarily reactive to circumstance. How wondrously cheerful would you feel if the boss wandered in to say youre getting a raise. Sadness descends if your beloved dog passes away. These are situational emotions, and for healthy functioning people, just part of lifes journey. Then there are mood fluctuations outside of situations. One morning you wake feeling well, rested, energized, positive, and ready to face the day ahead. Another day, the clouds are grey. You feel fatigued and drab and with no real desire to even feed the cat. So, when I say my mood is stablehttpswww.amazon.comdpB09GZKQWFP, thats what it looks like. A few highs and lows, but on a gentle fluctuating wave. But my wave is almost flat. Due to mood stabilizers surely nothing short of a modern medical miracle I struggle to feel up. Theres no get up and go. I rarely feel energized or excited. I just function. Getting out of bed and feeding the cat is all doable. I occasionally dust off the vacuum cleaner. If a friend wants to go for a walk, I can walk. When Im finalizing details for my book launch, I feel cheerful. There is movement at the mood station, but its not a lot. I expend the energy I have trying to look normal. I can do it dont get me wrong. This stabilization business sees me getting out there and conversing with people. I get a few things done. Occasionally wander off for a walk. But I miss the highs. I really miss them. Bipolar is a spectrum of moods from major depression through to mania. Bipolar II doesnt go all the way to full mania we have instead, what is called hypomania. These are periods of overactive and excited behavior that can have a significant impact on your daytoday life. Hypomania is a milder version of mania that lasts for a short period usually a few days. I gotta say, hypomania feels good. And thats when I can really crank up the vacuuming. To the outside observer, I might seem completely driven and focused, talking too fast, walking too fast, obsessing over details, completely sleepless, and coordinating a plethora of tasks simultaneously. But on the inside, I could climb a mountain. And Im sure a few of the mountains Ive climbed were inspired by hypomania. That doesnt sound too bad, right? But its part of a swinging pendulum, and when Im not well, all that machine gun energy will crash and burn to major depression. This is what happened to me. And it is this dangerously low major depression the mental health professionals are trying to steer me away from. I gotta say, I dont want to go back there either. The mood wave with phenomenal peaks and troughs. I have been on two mood stabilizing medications for 18 months. They appear to be doing a good job and aside from feeling flat all the time, there are no side effects. Everyone else seems pretty happy with this state of affairs. Im not. Now that Im stable, Im wanting more. It is not enough for me to just think about all the things I want to get done, I want the energy to do more than the basics. I want the energy to be selfmotivated. And so, I have made a decision. Im going to start reducing my medication. Just a little bit. And only under medical supervision. If the wave gets wobbly, I can always go back, but if I dont at least try a lower dose, I wont know what happens. Prior to the overdose, I had for a long time skipped my antidepressant medication on a regular basis. I never felt comfortable on it and the first thing the doctors did in hospital was take me off it. Antidepressants are apparently a bad idea for bipolar patients. I havent skipped a single, solid dose of my current meds. Not one. Ive been a very good girl and the results are paying off. But my psychiatrist agrees the ultimate aim for anyone is to be on the lowest working dose, so Im about to begin the great dosemodification experiment. Time will tell how it pans out. My secret hope is I become infused with enough energy to feel inspired and excited, but remain stable enough to sleep at night and stay focused. The most likely outcome is I wont notice a difference. At which point I will corner my psychiatrist and beg to go down another dose. If things go a little pearshaped, I can always go back up. Stability is a lovely thing to have. My life just sort of meanders along. But it also feels pointless. It is hard to find purpose in a life that does nothing more meaningful than stack the dishwasher and write the occasional blog post. I miss feeling like a fully functioning adult. So, I guess long story short, if I start writing blog posts on a daily basis, youll know Im starting to flirt with both ends of the mood spectrum.

        "input": "We Asked 12 People With Bipolar Disorder What Treatment Is Like Bipolar disorder is one of the most common mental health conditions, but it often doesnt receive the same amount of attention as mental illnesses like anxiety and depression. To shed light on reallife experiences with bipolar disorder, we asked our bipolar disorder community what their experiences with bipolar disorder treatment have been like. Heres what they shared with us. 1. Treatment for bipolar disorder takes time. My experience with bipolar treatment is ongoing. 2. It can be hard to find the right bipolar medication cocktail. Finding the right treatment has been a tough road Ive been hypomanic two times and extremely depressed and have done electroconvulsive therapy ECT. After all these years, Im finally taking the correct medication cocktail. 3. Bipolar disorder medication may be a catch22. Antidepressants worked well for me until I was hypomanic. I finally had a doctor who put me on a medication to treat bipolar disorder and an antidepressant, and it works really well for my moods. But I have a hard time getting things done since Im no longer hypomanic Its a catch22. 4. Medication and therapy can work well together to treat bipolar disorder. I have done cognitive behavioral therapy CBT with a psychologist and have also done group CBT. It worked really well for me. I am also on medication. 5. Electroconvulsive therapy ECT can be helpful in treating bipolar depression. I have treatmentresistant depression and am suicidal. I recently started ECT treatments, which seem to be helping me. httpspreview.redd.it20ntbyssba581.png?width574formatpngautowebps0f608fd45f3f80b2b4b3e98bb72638d668f7663b 6. Professionals may not fully discuss treatment for bipolar disorder. I was put on medication, given a bipolar disorder diagnosis and told nothing about bipolar disorder. 7. Bipolar disorder treatment isnt one size fits all. Unfortunately, bipolar disorder isnt like a health condition where one treatment fits everybody I am on medication for both bipolar disorder and PTSD, and I have a therapist. I also meditate and do breathing exercises, but that is still often not enough. 8. Finding the right medications for bipolar disorder can impact your emotions. When the psychiatrist and I were trying to find the right cocktail of bipolar disorder medications, I was in a zombielike state. Now that weve found what works for me, everything is great. 9. Fatphobia can influence treatment for bipolar disorder. In my first year of bipolar disorder treatment, the psychiatrist seemed more interested in keeping me from gaining weight than in focusing on the medications that would stabilize my moods. I was on five different mood stabilizers in under a year. 10. Bipolar disorder treatment can reduce manic episodes. I was finally prescribed medication to help with my depression, and it works for me. It helps with all my symptoms, and I have very few manic episodes now. 11. Mania can disappear for months or even years with proper treatment. I take an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer, which works really well for me. I have been stable no mania or depression for 18 months. It still feels too good to be true. 12. The right providers make all the difference in treating bipolar disorder. I have been extremely fortunate to have a very good psychiatrist and wonderful psychologists. I dont know what I would have done without them.",

        "input": "What Its Like to Have the Other Type of Bipolar Disorder I have bipolar II disorder. This is my story. First, some background. Bipolar disorder used to be called manicdepressive illness, and many people still know and refer to it that way. The term bipolar reflects the concept that there are two extremes to the continuum of mood disorders, and some people swing dramatically from one to the other. According to this definition, clinical depression by itself is unipolar, occupying only one end of the spectrum. Depression is to sadness as a broken leg is to a splinter. Depression sucks the life from a person, mutes all emotions except misery, denies any possibility of joy or even contentment and makes life seem meaningless or impossible. This is hell. Mania is to ordinary happiness as diving off a cliff is to diving off a diving board. Mania brings exhilaration, ambition, confidence, abandon and invincibility, with no brakes. It is hell on wheels. Oscillating between the two extremes, thats bipolar disorder, type 1. It is a serious illness. Left untreated, it can cause destruction of families, careers and more. It can lead to psychosis or suicide. The treatments for it are no picnic either. A severe case of bipolar disorder often requires hospitalization. If the symptoms can be controlled with medication, then the patients must have frequent blood tests to assure that the drug is present in the right quantity. When I was incorrectly diagnosed with unipolar depression, I used to wish that I were bipolar, on the theory that at least then I could accomplish something. Boy, was I wrong about that. Plans made in mania never come to fruition. They are started, rethought, abandoned, exchanged for something grander and ultimately fizzle out when the mania wears off. My diagnosis actually made some sense at the time, as I never experienced anything like the manic highs. All I got were depressive lows. This leads us at last to bipolar II disorder. The mood swings are not as extreme, the lows less debilitating and the highs less overwhelming. The person with bipolar II stays closer to a baseline of normal mood, but still experiences swings back and forth. Technically, the minilows are called dysthymia and the minihighs are called hypomania. In my case, the lows were just as low as in unipolar depression, but I never got the minijags of buoyancy that accompany hypomania. Instead, these feelings, came out sideways, as anxiety. My brain was still racing with little control, but in a different direction. Instead of elation and purpose, I was beset by in worries, fears and catastrophizing. One of the difficulties with treating bipolar disorder of either type is trying to find a medication or a combination of medications that will level out the persons moods. Usually this requires more than one drug, and finding the right mix or cocktail of chemicals usually requires more than one drug. It takes a great deal of trial and error. In the meantime, the mood swings continue. At this point, my bipolar II is fairly wellcontrolled on medication. I still have spells of depression. Now, they last at most a week and sometimes just a day or two. Untreated, they could last months or years. I still have anxiety too. However, I have the medication I take for that so I dont feel like Im about to jump out of my own skin. Most of the time, Im fairly highfunctioning. I can write, work and earn a living. I have a great marriage and a number of friends, including some who are closer than family to me. I have never been hospitalized, nor have I had electroshock though that was a near thing. Before I got my proper diagnosis and treatment, I would have not believed this to be possible. My goal in life was simply to stay out of a psychiatric hospital as long as I could or at least until I qualified for Social Security Disability. Im sharing these experiences with you today because I believe mental disorders should not be hidden or viewed with shame and horror as they have been in the past and sometimes the present. Its undeniable that there is a stigma associated with having mental illness. Going public with it entails a risk. Ive seen the fixed smile and back away slowly reaction. Ive seen sudden turnarounds in my work performance evaluations, but Ive also seen the, Me too! response. There is strength in numbers. As more of us who live with psychiatric conditions talk about it and share our stories, the more we build understanding. Perhaps, we also encourage those who are rollercoastering to seek treatment. So thats the nuts and bolts of it Bipolar II disorder is a mental illness. I have it and live with it every day. I do not go around threatening the safety of other people or my own. I take medication for it. I know I will likely have to for the rest of my life, and Im OK with that. I hope that eventually the rest of the world will be, too.",

Although bipolar disorder is one of the most common mental illnesses, its also one of the most misunderstood. To shed light on bipolar disorder, we asked members of our bipolar disorder community what they want others to know about their lives with the menta health condition. Heres what they had to say. 1. People with bipolar disorder can feel emotions deeply. I feel everything a lot more than people may think. 2. Mania isnt enjoyable. I do not enjoy mania I hate the hypersexuality, the agitation, and the obsession. 3. Bipolar disorder isnt a choice. Bipolar disorder is not a choice. You cant get over it you have to fight with every ounce of strength you have. Its a chemical imbalance, not a choice. 4. Bipolar disorder can be painful. Bipolar disorder is more painful than anyone could imagine. Although bipolar disorder can bring me a zest for life at times, it can also bring excruciating pain. 5. Living with bipolar disorder can take a lot of energy. I wish people understood the literal mental combat I go through just to stay present. I wish people knew just how much effort it takes just to manage my symptoms. Im using every ounce of energy I can find to keep myself healthy. 6. People often make assumptions about bipolar disorder. The bipolar disorder stereotype people may think of is someone being extremely angry one moment and then being super nice later. People assume that if you dont act like that, then you must be fine, even if you arent. httpspreview.redd.it5yuts3rryx381.png?width750formatpngautowebpsaabeded893bdc88a610927696e2aaf3f11078c4b 7. Bipolar disorder can cause rapid mood changes. I wish others understood that my mood, feelings, and emotional expression can change very quickly with no apparent reason. 8. Bipolar disorder can make starting the day difficult. There are days I can barely get out of bed. 9. People with bipolar disorder arent dangerous. In my case, the only person Im dangerous to is myself. Im not the monster under your bed. I wish people knew Im not a monster just because I have bipolar disorder. 10. People with bipolar disorder are human. I am human. I can have a bad day at work and feel unhappy about it for reasons that have nothing to do with bipolar disorder. 11. Medication can help keep people with bipolar disorder stable. I have bipolar I, and I must have medication to keep me as emotionally stable as possible. If I dont, I spiral out of control in both manic and depressive states. When I forget to take my medication, everything, even the smallest things, can be a struggle. 12.

Concentratul la ceva e aproape imposibil, i evit contactul social, simindum adesea vinovat sau inutil. Somnul i pofta de mncare sunt i ele afectate. 2. ntrun episod maniacal fie sunt extrem de euforic, fie iritabil. Sunt plin de energie, gndurile mi alearg, vorbesc rapid, i devin impulsiv. Pot s iau decizii riscante, s cheltuiesc bani aiurea, i nu simt nevoia de somn m simt invincibil, dei judecata mea nu e tocmai cea mai bun. 3. ntrun episod hipomaniacal sunt foarte energic i optimist, dar fr a ajunge la extreme.

Im going to start with a few small trips early this year and do bigger trips over summer. Initially, I organized the summer trip to keep myself busy, as I will not have a job this summer due to limitations on my contract. I decided theres nothing better to do in my free time than visit some places abroad, so I started making arrangements to become a globetrotter and do some work along the way. It started out with a commitment to one month in Europe, where I will be staying with a team of people while we all work on a project. Its a very unique opportunity in a great environment, and it was also an excellent reason to go abroad. I managed to get accommodations, food, etc., covered for insanely cheap, which made it even better. But thats only one month, and I have three to burn. Again, no job to keep me busy until August, so I decided to apply to a bunch of internships and positions. I didnt think anything much would come of it, but I figured no harm could be done. I sent out 46 emails and got about 20 responses. Most of them said there were no positions available, but a few said they could take on unofficial volunteers, and even fewer said they could take an actual intern. There were two positions in particular that I had emailed about, and they are highly prestigious, to the point that I didnt think Id even get an email back. But lo and behold, they replied, and I couldnt believe it. Of those two, I ended up picking the position which I felt would be the most useful and interesting. It is at a worldrenowned institution, in a position envied and admired by quite literally everyone in my field. I was blown away when they replied, but they genuinely welcomed me and said I could come work with them. I kept thinking the opportunity would disappear until this morning, when I had a virtual meeting with them, and Ive now confirmed that this is actually happening. Im now going to spend 2 months in Europe this summer, kickstarting a hopefully long career of literal and figurative exploration, fulfilling my dreams, meeting new people, and having a great time. It still doesnt feel quite real. I have a really hard time giving myself credit for what Ive accomplished, and I am waiting for this to slip through my fingers and into the hands of someone more deserving. But this is happening, I earned it, and Im so, so excited!",

It can be tough dealing with these residual effects, but Im almost completely unbothered because I am so genuinely happy.

Hes got a huge idea for a new project only remotely artrelated, more about the metaversecrypto space, and has been lacking sleep, talking fast and erratically, crying tears of joy on and off, had lots of highs and lows. Weve talked almost exclusively about his new idea for the past few days, and I dont share the same excitement he has because I dont fully understand his idea, and if Im being honest, some of the things hes been saying have sounded crazy I dont like using that word in this context, but to the average person, thats probably the word theyd use. Ive somewhat considered leaving him because Ive seen a totally new side of him. Its like hes a completely different person, not the person Ive always known and loved. Its actually scaring me. Have any of you guys had episodes like this, or known someone? Was it shortlived? Is it just that hes sleepdeprived? What can I do to help him, give him space or give him support for what seems to me like a borderline crazy idea? Will he have these episodes more frequently as he gets older?

Warning that I kind of devolve into self bashing here, so if that would bother you or get negative thoughts going please skip. Hope this kind of post is ok. Im a long time professional sad with a handful of shitty illnesses on my list. Art is that one thing I feel even the slightest bit of actual enthusiasm for any more, Im sure many of you relate. Im not in as deep of a bad depressive episode atm and have gotten used to how bad my other illnesses affect me... but its still so fucking hard!! I can sit down and open up my sketchbook and dabble, but consistently working on a piece that I want to finish and be proud of is something i havent managed in years. Ive tried to do a little daily, but I get discouraged or too tired and stop. Im also recently off of a multi month slump. I feel like Im further behind than ever and that i should give up in every way. I wanted to be a professional illustrator or concept artist, but I feel too old for it im coming up on 25, my online acquaintances are getting professional dream jobs, im still me and like Ill never make it now. There is nothing special or amazing about my art, so why would I be picked above another? Satisfaction is so rare for me now. I dont know what i want to make, or why. Ill start something and maybe even like it but stop because Im not sure its the right art to be making. Its infuriating. And really saddening. Also i want whatever the people who can go to work and do art the same day are on. Or sometimes who can just do stuff in their houses and art same day. But regardless, ugh. I just want to do better. I see the drive and energy and ability and passion it seems to take to make it as an artist.. and Im worried I just dont have it. I rolled a bad hand and feel so stuck. Send tips if you can. Thanks. 3",

        "input": "I dont know how to approach drawing anymore. It hurts so bad and I dont see any glimmer of hope. Id like to both vent and ask for advice. Ever since I picked drawing upabout 3.5 years ago I guess I have struggled without any success. I dont want to go in detail about the past before picking it up and other personal problems which have or still are affecting me. All I want you to know is that they were a problem. I want to keep this shortish since I dont want to cry for longer than necessary. Anyways, the first 2 years were 90 an emotional war. I almost never drew and when I did, I almost always started crying. I almost entirely got rid of this by now though. I literally started at toddler level and me being so much worse than other beginners was painful. Even now, Im at about a beginner level for an 18 years old. A few beginners I sometimes find online are even better than me now. For reasons like this, I never understood why people always say talent doesnt matter. Maybe Im talking out of my ass but most people who say that had advantages from the start. Be it a better starting point, which helps since the eye is behind the hand or understanding different concepts quicker. Improving faster doesnt matter as much but it still is a thing. This can also be affected by how you practice though. On top of being absolute trash, I had difficulty understanding basic concepts and not the best improvement speed. I spent like 5 hours with someone, sometime in the first 2 years to understand how to draw from that 34 perspective. When I got to the basic perspective part in drawabox, I spent close to two weeks trying to understand it and even then I didnt grasp it fully. I didnt spend as much time thinking or drawing nor did it daily in that period but I think I still put like 10 hours into trying to figure it out. Some people were surprised I took so long which was a huge hit to my self esteem at the time. I first tried drawabox sometime last year. Got back to it near the end of 2018, took a break again and I got back to it again. I know that people didnt try to push me down with that and stuff like you realised that now? but its still disheartening. I literally feel like I have no chance when art as a whole is my life. The following years after the Disaster Double were mainly fine. I could draw more and more consistently but it still wasnt enough and isnt enough. I took a ton of breaks too. My biggest issue is how I ran out of things to try. Everyone online only told me just force yourself to draw daily and dont wait for motivation. I tend to have start crying more often when I have motivation to draw stuff just because I like to draw really complex stuff. Waiting for motivation doesnt work, but neither making a habit of drawing daily. I tried doing that so many times, and for a while, it works, usually a couple weeks. In the end all my attempts crumbled beneath my feet and I was sent back to break territory. Nobody ever considers how others feel when giving personal advice. They always just say Everyone goes through that. Im unsure how many people struggled for so long and so often. Most people seem to be fine after they get drawing. This maybe just is me being angry at myself for my experience, but this is the general idea I got from people. It was even worse when I had a few people tell me maybe drawing isnt for you. That really is the worst thing I ever heard. Why would I put myself through so much pain when I dont want to learn art for fame or money or whatever else? I want to learn it for me because Im passionate. I even tried giving up a few times, but drawing never left my head ever since I picked it up and I cant give up on it. I gave up on a lot of things due to frustration, and really quickly. This is the only thing that stuck with me. Even though due to classmates making fun of my stuff in first grade which made me give up art entirely in fourth grade I still always created stuff. It maybe was just in my head through imagination, but it was my way of coping with that. I tried some other things too but nothing really worked. I cant recall them though. I could really appreciate all advice I could get. I hope that I got my point across. I cant concentrate well when Im talking about art. Thanks for reading my vent! Also, sorry for acting like a prick. I kind of am jealous of people who got luckier with art than I did. I tried to improve myself and become as nice of a person as I could, which I did but I still cant get over that. Im a horrible person for thinking that way. It just hurts so much I act without thinking straight.",

They left me broken, bruised, and battered my heart, my mind, my body, my soul, all shattered. They brought back things I hoped would stay gone, things I wish had never existed at all. They buried the progress I had made, the positivity I had built, under the weight of it all. Optimism felt like a curse, and all that was left was pessimism and nihilism, dragging me into darkness. Everything went black. My heart felt stolen. My eyes refused to see hope. But lately, something shifted. Light started to break through the cracks. Life came back to me, slowly, cautiously, but undeniably. Hope returned, just a glimmer at first, but then it grew. My heart came back too. It grew three times its size, pushing through the hurt, beating stronger than before. I owe my survival to my guardian angels, the people who stood by me when I couldnt stand on my own. They were the stars guiding me back to safety, their love, their grace, their strength holding me together as I learned how to move forward again. I owe them everything. But I also owe myself something. Because without my strength even just the smallest piece of it none of what they did would have worked. Their efforts wouldnt have mattered if I hadnt let them in, if I hadnt made the choice to keep going. So while I praise them and give them all the credit they deserve and they do deserve it all I also have to give myself credit. Because I deserve it too. Without me, I wouldnt be here. So thank you, me, for finding a way to survive when everything felt impossible, for opening your eyes again to the light.",

Weve been here before, made it through, More times than we nearly didnt. I know how scary it is to return, But Im here with you. Youre not alone, never have been, Despite the loneliness felt. Youre terrified beyond belief, But I promise, youre safer than you realize, Better equipped to survive now than ever before. These suicidal feelings, urges, Just your brain being a dick. Fuck that noise. Thats all it isnoise, Amplified by pain, Youve silenced a billion times over. Its torture, but temporary Succumbing is permanent. Youre lost, confused, But I will guide you through it. Ill be here forever. If you cant survive for others, Then survive for yourself. You deserve to live. Read that again YOU DESERVE TO LIVE, And you will. I apologize for the bold caps, But it needed to be emphasized. You dont want to die Youre just so desperate to be free from pain, Willing to take that escape. Most people dont understand, But I do, and Im not alone. When the suicidal thoughts come, Let them pass. When the suicidal urges come, Tell your brain to fuck off. When the thoughts, and urges overwhelm, Remember, you arent lost or alone, And that youre safe. You are SAFE. Take my hand, Ill guide you through this. I love you. I wrote this during the worst depression Ive ever experiencedwithout being suicidal. It felt bizarre, in a good way, to be so deeply depressed without the usual suicidal urges. For me, those two things almost always go handinhand, torturing me together. In that strange, bittersweet moment of clarity, I decided to take advantage of not having to constantly fight off the overwhelming desire to die. I wrote this poema letter to myselffor the next time I am suicidal, hoping it might inspire me or at least ease some of the pain when Im in that dark place again. These are all the things Im forced to forget when severe depression takes overwhen suicidal urges consume my every thought. These are the truths I need to remember in my worst moments to help me get through them. I ended the poem by saying, I love you to myself, which, along with You deserve to live, are the most important words in it. Do I love myself? No. Have I ever loved myself? Also no. But I want to love myself. I hope that by the next time I, unfortunately, find myself suicidal, Ill feel differently about myself. Maybe, just maybe, if I keep saying, I love you to myself, Ill eventually convince my brain its true. I dont want these words to be limited to just me. If youre suicidal, this poemthis letteris also for you. I mean every word in it. Youll get through this. You are stronger than you know.

I created this mixed media piece to help process a CSA that occurred by a family friendmy moms coworker over the span of 3 years. It plays on the innocence at the time and not understanding the weight of the abuse. The silver letters are my voice now. My abuser would assault me in the dark room at my moms work, and taught me a lot about photography. He would show me porn of flash drives and assault me with objects. The photo in the top left is me swimming at his pool. I thought we were best friends and he eventually died of cancer. I kept the abuse hidden from my parents and would hide underwear with blood and body fluids in a plastic bag in my closet. The stickers are from my actual childhood but everything else is recreated. The opposite of trauma is play, and sometimes there is both.",

Making it through a meal with you, much like disarming a bomb, Severed all my joy and chatter Replaced it with an anxious, eerie calm.
