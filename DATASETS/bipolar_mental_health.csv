"Told my illness to go fuck itself How its always worked is five bad months, one ""getting-better"" month, 1 good week, a few days manic, get fired and pick up the pieces. For years. Then one day after a year of therapy I was able to make it two months, and being normal for two months was the greatest thing to have ever happened to me.

Then I got the chance to do it again and I fucked it up. It was looking like another five months of everything sucking. Getting kicked out of school, etc, etc, and the typical late 20s mental illness party train.

But I said no. Went up on my meds. Started caffiene (methylfinadate) maeks me manic, and starting all my coping mechanisms over again. Its not certain, nothings certain but its working. I think I'm back in the game. My illness is fighting back, but I'm stubborn as a mule in mud (and love that about myself). This time the story ends with surviving.

Fuck you bipolar. Fuck borderline, adhd, and the other shit too. I'm going to live. I'm going to be a lawyer. I'm done hating myself. I like the person I am, and like the person I'm becoming even more. Love this community. We're all going to do it.

I have children and I can't remember important moments in their lives (first words, first steps, etc) and it's been bothering me.

"Having a mixed episode, bipolar I  Anniversaries are hard for me, and I was released from the hospital a year ago on Halloween (kind of a funny story üòÖ) 

I have been




-disassociating really hard





-having that feeling of ""this isn't real"" which sometimes happens when I'm not having an episode but when I am it won't go away 












-having either really slow or fast thoughts that I can't talk away 







-talking quickly, so quickly that my clients have noticed 








-just feeling like dogshit in general, except for the periods where I'm over happy










-needing less sleep (this is big. And when I sleep it's like blink I'm asleep blink it's hours later, I don't feel like my mind got to rest) 








-forgetting/denying myself food 








-unsafe sexual activity (I'm usually really good about this) 












-so much irritability 










My psych is upping my antipsychotic so that's ... I know it's good but I know it like I know I have a foot, or I have a chair in my room. Like it's true but it doesn't feel real and it certainly doesn't like. matter, if that makes sense









This has been going on for at least three weeks,probably longer but it's been bad recently 








I guess I'm just sharing to remind myself that this isnt permanent. It's never been permanent before and it won't be this time, that's the thing about this disorder lol 












And I hope you can remember that too.

"Intrusive Driving Thoughts Recently I've been having more extreme intrusive thoughts and images while driving.

I am unsure what could fully be causing this because I have been driving for around 6 months to a year now. 

One problem I am also having about this is that I have been wanting to hang out with my boyfriend, but I've been in this challenging spot where I don't like to drive a lot and i dont fully know how to verbalize these thoughts correctly, and I feel like he gets frustrated because he has to drive a lot..

"Always feeling scared and guilty Does anyone else feel scared of how others perceive you when you‚Äôre going through a severe depressive episode? I‚Äôm so scared that others are judging me for changing overnight. I haven‚Äôt changed overnight, it‚Äôs just becoming harder to act okay. 

For example, it‚Äôs been getting increasingly difficult to focus at work and I struggle to put my words together when I write and speak. I constantly feel like my coworkers look down on me as someone who can‚Äôt form basic sentences and it feels so alienating. 

I wish I could run away and hide from everything and everyone. My brain feels like mashed potatoes that are going bad and I randomly start crying because I‚Äôm always in so much pain.

"Newly diagnosed with bipolar I recently was told that I have bipolar 2. I had my suspicions for some years that I was because my depression never really felt like normal depression but something much deeper and sometimes much darker.

It's been a lot to process. Finding out has brought a lot of emotions. Some of them have been shame because of the stigma around mental health and what I've seen. There has been a lot of finding out and thinking back to a lot of things, just going ""that makes sense now, that adds up."" Between those feelings, a lot of things started to add up as to why when I felt a certain way in a depressive episode, I had no explanation as to why I felt that way, I just felt that way for no actual reason.

Recently I had, what I am realizing now a mixed episode that is a big reason that I decided to be very open and vulnerable in therapy about how I've been feeling and how low the lows truly do get. I've been looking back at things and the signs of it were always there and a lot of times I just said I was going through a lot (I have had dealt with a lot of trauma) and it was nothing else other than that. Now things have began to make sense in my life and it's began to help me truly understand myself even more than I have before. It's nice to see posts on here and not feel so alone, crazy, or like a horrible person when I'm having an episode.",bipolar
"First ‚Äúreal‚Äù mixed episode I just joined this subreddit.

After I take my meds in the morning I feel like my insides are on fire and I‚Äôm ready to cause destruction, but not in an angry way just in like, a reckless way. Then throughout the day I‚Äôm talking and laughing at work while also actively trying not to think about anything other than the current moment or else I‚Äôll burst into tears.

"Irritability / anger 41F, bipolar 1. 

I'm inpatient at the moment having my lithium levels stabilized (and other stuff, it's been a rough year) but over the last week I've noticed something completely new - I'm fine in the morning but around lunchtime things start to irritate me very easily. By midafternoon I'm quietly hostile and that progresses to snapping at people and feeling extremely angry over things that are insignificant. For example, I was in an art therapy group and had to leave because the woman next to me was *coloring too loudly.*

I'm usually very patient, tolerant and happy-go-lucky, when I get sick any anger I feel is turned inward. Feeling this way is completely foreign to me and I'm struggling to cope. My psych said it's not uncommon in bipolar and we're keeping an eye on it but because the lithium is currently high I'm on half my normal dose, which he doesn't want to increase back up until we work out why it's gone so high.

I've snapped at a few nurses (and apologized of course!) and I'm worried that I'll act out of anger and do something worse.

"I'm either really good at my job or really bad at it. Anyone else? I've had a lot of different jobs in my life. I'm 30. I've worked in b3havioral and public health, logistics, social services, restaurants, legal, and finance. 

I wanted to try different avenues and truth is, it wasn't always out of curiosity. I just flat out needed a job in most cases. 

But I either sucked really badly i.e. terminated, performance improvement plans, cut hours, or did really good i.e. several promotions in one job, generous recommendations, and performance-based bonuses. 

If anything, I now know what I'm good at and will stick to it from here on out. Granted, my health hasn't been great these past few years i.e. my hearing and vision loss due to rare disordwrs. So there's that.

"Overwhelmed Hi everyone :)
Just wanted to share with all of you how I‚Äôm feeling right now. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with bipolar (type 3, I think, my psychiatrist is not sure) 5 months ago. I‚Äôm on humor stabilizer medication since the beginning of the year growing now to 300mg.
Anyway, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs normal or not, but my mood swings are quite drastic and quick and I‚Äôm feeling hopeless and overwhelmed. I spend my days alone because I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends and I keep canceling plans anyway. I feel like nobody understands me, and I think sometimes I even sabotage my relationships because Im afraid deep down they will leave me anyway at some point. I think I‚Äôm too much for them. Like a burden. I hate complaining or saying this stuff, but it is true to my heart.
I just wanted to know your experience, if you think maybe my medication is not working or if it is normal to have these mood swings after a few months and growing medication? Is it still a process? I mean, sometimes I‚Äôm good but there are days where I my thoughts are very dark and suicidal. I‚Äôm feeling desperate, I have health issues now because when I feel low I find refuge on fast food, and now that I have to change my food routine, it‚Äôs freaking me out too, because if that changes too, what pleasure will I have if I keep feeling like shit? What refuge or little pleasure will I find to cope? It‚Äôs a rollercoaster and I feel like I can‚Äôt get out of it and just rest.

I feel alone, solitude sucks man, it really sucks. It‚Äôs been years I feel like this, now it gets worse and I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs related to my medication, maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking it? Sometimes I think I‚Äôm not bipolar, I don‚Äôt know why. I‚Äôm afraid medication is turning me into this, it‚Äôs been a rough year.
I‚Äôm sorry, it‚Äôs a lot, I just needed to write it out.
 
Either way, I read your messages and it feels good to feel less alone. Like somebody understands a little, or a lot. I feel seen. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing here.

Have a beautiful weekend.

My experience of bipolarity was mystical to say the least. I made great discoveries about myself, as well as others. I experienced doubt about everything and everyone and especially about myself. I found my way back by tirelessly repeating precise sentences to myself, like mantras, to determine right from wrong, my life from my traumas, ‚Äúreality‚Äù vs. psychosis. I rebuilt myself with each episode. I hope stronger. Through alternative methods.

But once I got the diagnosis, I actually felt a huge sense of relief. For the first time, everything made sense. I understood why my emotions were so intense and unpredictable.

Getting diagnosed early has really given me hope. I‚Äôm learning how to manage my meds, create routines, and slowly get back into the things I love. It‚Äôs not always easy, but I‚Äôm starting to feel more like myself again.

This journey has taught me that even when things feel tough, there‚Äôs always a way forward. I may have my ups and downs, but I‚Äôm not giving up. The future still feels full of possibilities, and I‚Äôm excited to see where I can go from here.

"Just got out of my first hospitalization I feel like I writing an old school Penthouse style letter to the editor ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this just happened to me‚Ä¶‚Äù 

I just got out of a 72 hour psych hold after heading to the ER (willingly). I was having probably the worst mixed episode to date and was spiraling for at least a month before it all sort of came to a head. I was going from hypomanic to depressed in fits of hours to days. This culminated in me storming a Taco Bell kitchen demanding they hurry up , to saying some pretty f‚Äôd up things to my spouse. Finally came to a head when I found myself playing chicken on the freeway closing my eyes off and on. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever imagined myself ever being that far gone. 

My spouse finally convinced me to seek immediate help by threatening to leave with the kids .. and even as I strolled into the ER I thought to myself how wrong she was. Fortunately when the nurses and doctor came to see me- I finally broke down. When the security guard showed up and I was told I‚Äôd be transferred to an inpatient center. 

Fortunately it was a very positive experience, if painful to get there. The center was definitely well run and patient centric. After giving me some Adavan and crashing for a day- I was able to participate in groups and therapies for the next couple of days. The psychiatrist also updated my meds, adding new ones to the mix that I‚Äôm optimistic for.

I‚Äôd like to think and hope this will be my last time, but I also find comfort that despite some of the horror stories, there are great places for me to find hello when it gets dark. I count myself lucky.",bipolar

In March I went into a severe hypomanic episode for 9wks that didn't respond to med changes and I was nonfunctional, had psychotic symptoms and just overall was not good. The hallucinations and paranoia stuck around until about a month ago though. Ever since we've been trying to sort out my meds so I can get to a more stable place but it's just been one change after another and I'm so done.

"Caffeine & Coming off SSRIs Hi there! I recently got diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and my psychiatrist told me to limit, if not eliminate, caffeine.

"Just need to get this off my chest  I start a new med today and I am a combination of fearful and optimistic. It‚Äôs the first time an antipsychotic has been added to my regimen, and in a weird way, it feels like I failed. I‚Äôm in danger of losing my job (for the millionth time) thanks to this cursed disorder so I‚Äôm getting desperate to find a way to live better with these mood swings and stay employed and safe.  

Some background: I had my first manic episode in 2016, absolutely spurred by SSRI‚Äôs, and while I almost made the ultimate permanent decision to depart the planet, I was able to get help and that led to my bipolar I diagnosis, and the real work began.  

With proper support and meds, and essentially quitting alcohol, I stabilized for the most part by 2019. But then 2020 happened, and as someone who lives in the US during such an intense time, I backslid in a big way with my mental health. For the last 4 years I‚Äôve been going up and down like a yo-yo, on an overall downward trajectory. I‚Äôve cycled through multiple trades jobs since then, and early this year landed a carpentry job. I love the work so much, am learning a lot, and my natural creativity is a boon to this work.  

Unfortunately, my boss (who I was friends with before getting the job, and still am) had to talk with me about my mood swings. It was done kindly but firmly, and I don‚Äôt resent him in the slightest, but I am embarrassed and dejected about still feeling like a friggen slave to this disorder.  

So for the last 4 years, I‚Äôve said ‚Äúno‚Äù to many medications because of the work I do. I‚Äôm highly sensitive to medication changes, even small adjustments make me feel off for a few weeks. So even when things are extra activated, I‚Äôm still refusing to try new meds that can possibly help. My refusal is always based on the demands of capitalism and the potentially life-ending tools and machines I use as a tradie. I can‚Äôt be dizzy or sleepy or jumpy when using a table saw or router, it‚Äôs unsafe for me and others in the shop/ on the job site. So I am always saying no to med adjustments so I can try to keep my head clear (lol), until last week.  

As an American, and a leftist at that, the last few weeks have been especially hellish. I saw myself spiraling, and foolishly thought I was masking it well enough at work, so I was crushed when my boss had to have a talk with me, as I‚Äôm apparently killing the morale. Real, but ouch, but real.  

I had a depressing revelation after that talk, when discussing with my psychiatrist what happened at work and how my mental health is tanking: I don‚Äôt know if I can do work like this much longer. I kept choosing to stay on the current regimen of meds so I can safely use the tools of my trade, but my mood is canceling out any progress I make in my jobs. **It feels like there is no job in existence that wouldn‚Äôt make my mental health worse.** And believe me, I‚Äôve tried to do a little bit of everything. I‚Äôm almost fucking 40 and still don‚Äôt know where I belong, and feel like any progress I make in a job is dashed upon the rocky shore of cold reality as soon as my mood becomes too intense to mask.  

I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm heartbroken. Just needed to vent. And I‚Äôm crossing all my fingers and toes hoping that this new antipsychotic will help balance my broken brain so that MAYBE someday I can actually have a career, or at the very least, not have to live paycheck to paycheck. Thanks for reading, genuine advice is welcome.",bipolar
"update Recently switched psychiatrists since my last psych was hot garbage and were planning to wait two months I was not willing to wait to even thoroughly assess me, let alone medicate me (my symptoms are through the roof atm its been a rollercoaster trying to keep myself safe). Going to be reassessed on the 13th with a much better group that knows what they are doing so I‚Äôm happy about that. 

My question is, I can‚Äôt tell whether I‚Äôm fluctuating rapidly between mania and depression, or if this is a ‚Äúmixed‚Äù state. I‚Äôm surely going to know when I start having frequent sessions. But for now, to ease my mind and help me explain my symptoms to my family and close friends who‚Äôd like to assist me, what would you say?

I pretty much have all manic symptoms minus rapid speech when I‚Äôm not actually in my bed. So extreme reserves of energy, racing thoughts, invincible (both happy and brash, like nobody could ever shoot me down and succeed) mood, the lack of impulse control, etc. But I‚Äôve simultaneously never ever felt this tired in my life. So I‚Äôve been sleeping up to 18 hours a day, unable to get out of bed until i sleep at-least 12 hours. But whilst bed-bound, I feel restless. I work on my book, I apply for jobs, things I can‚Äôt necessarily do when I‚Äôm straight up depressed. Now that I‚Äôm typing it out it seems much clearer. But in my head it doesn‚Äôt make sense, due to how recently I came out of mania, and how different this feeling is to just straight up mania or straight up depression. It‚Äôs something else entirely.

"struggling with recent diagnosis of Bipolar 2. advice welcome! I have never really posted before so i don't know if this is what this is for or not but here we go. 



I was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2, at first i was terrified to get diagnosed  i  knew in my core long before i made the appointment as i had a family history of it. after being terrified with just thinking of being diagnosed now i am terrified that this will be my  life forever, i have always felt that life for me was a constant fight that i could never win but i kept up the good fight as that was what was expected of me no matter how much i wanted to lay down and give up some unseen force has always driven me to fight back  and push long after i have given up the fight goes on. Now i know the fight is real and not just something i was making up and i'm exhausted and still want to give up but cant i march ever forward. 

it's weird knowing that these thoughts are mine but not mine, i feel and dont feel this way, i take the pills and no change. I take more pills and still no change in therapy i dont think its helping i don't know what to do or what to say i always know what to do and what to say before i go anywhere i have to that's how i survived this long.

When will i see the light at the end, is there even a light at the end. everything i keep reading says it gets worse as you age and here i am at 31 just getting diagnosed and looking back i can see that i have been dealing with this since i was 11 and i didnt have help no one knew i didn't even know i just found ways to work around it and make situations work for me or found ways to avoid them if i knew i couldn't make it work. 

I hold myself to such a high standard i wonder does this diagnoses even matter i have been pushing through it for this long what's the rest of my life anyways really if i can make it this long i can make it to the end right?

maybe it's not real maybe i am just saying all the right buzz words regurgitating them back like a parrot and making everyone else believe that i am bipolar but what if i am not and i'm just fooling everyone around me.

  
i still don't even understand what this means bipolar 2 i have googled and read a millions posts that all seem like stories of my own and it almost convinced me maybe they are right maybe this is the answer and maybe the end is in sight and i can be normal. that's all i have ever wanted was to be normal that's why i work so hard to pretend and be the person everyone expects i put on the mask and everything is ok.

i just want to be normal is that ever going to happen and if it does am i going to miss myself like so many others i have seen post?

i'm sorry i just had to share with someone anyone really i don't know if i want answers or not but just writing this out has made me feel better.

"Is my psychiatrist a quack? My psychiatrist is notorious for thinking I‚Äôm fine and not in need of a medication change even when I‚Äôm describing manic/probably problematic behavior like buying a $400/month car when a beater would have done fine.

So, about 2 days a week I‚Äôll skip my sedating meds and stay up late or not sleep at all.

I was surprised too because we‚Äôre always taught how important medication adherence is with this illness, yet my psychiatrist was seemingly unconcerned by me skipping doses here and there.

"Am I the only one who dives headfirst into relationships when I‚Äôm manic? Am I the only one who dives headfirst into relationships when I‚Äôm manic?

For a long time, I knew something wasn‚Äôt right inside me, but I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it. It wasn‚Äôt until I went to therapy and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 19 that it started to make sense. Now, at 23, I can see how each of my three relationships was really a way to distract myself from the chaos in my mind. I‚Äôve been carrying the weight of sexual trauma, too, which has made me hypersexual. When I look back, I realize I didn‚Äôt genuinely love any of them‚ÄîI was just convincing myself that I did, maybe because I was so scared of being alone or facing my own pain.

Each relationship turned toxic, one after the other. I know I had a part in it. I forced myself to believe they were everything, that I loved them, and I depended on them so heavily that it was like I couldn‚Äôt breathe without them. Every day, my mood and self-worth revolved around them. And then, when things ended, it felt like my whole world shattered. I‚Äôd be left sleepless, unable to eat, and begging to be taken back, calling them constantly because I couldn‚Äôt bear the emptiness. Looking back now, I see it wasn‚Äôt love‚Äîit was this unhealthy, all-consuming obsession, fueled by this desperate need to feel close to someone, anyone.

Right now, it feels unbearable. I just got out of another relationship a month ago, and even though I chased him and poured so much into it, now I hate him, and I hate myself for even being with him. The regret is overwhelming. I feel like I don‚Äôt even know what real love is, like maybe I‚Äôm just broken inside, doomed to keep repeating this painful cycle. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me, but this disorder is tearing me apart. Does anyone feel this way ? It‚Äôs like meeting someone and they quickly become your whole world. You get so attached, so wrapped up in them that every part of who they are feels perfect, like they were meant for you. The obsession runs deep‚Äîyou love every detail, every moment, and it feels like you couldn‚Äôt live without them. But the second they hurt you, it‚Äôs like a switch flips. Suddenly, everything you once adored about them turns into something you resent. That connection that felt so intense turns painful, and all those little things you loved now just remind you of the hurt.

It‚Äôs a cycle of extreme highs and lows, where love feels all-consuming one minute, and then the next, you‚Äôre filled with anger and regret. It‚Äôs such a confusing and exhausting way to love because every moment feels like everything‚Äîuntil it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like everything felt so real, but looking back, it was all built on lust and attraction. The connection felt intense, almost overwhelming, but maybe it was just the rush, the thrill, and not a deeper bond. I think I was seeing something that wasn‚Äôt really there‚Äîjust creating a version of them in my mind that I wanted to believe in.

Maybe I was just caught up, delusional, and manic, swept away in the high of it all. Then, when it was over, it‚Äôs like the illusion fell apart, leaving me with nothing but the emptiness.

"Should I date this person?/What needs do you need in a partnership?  For context, I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 after a 4-month long manic episode 3 years ago. I have since been medicated and have been ‚Äústable‚Äù, not experiencing anything more severe than the occasional hypomania and rapid cycling.

I just started dating someone who I met three months ago. We have been communicating really well on what we‚Äôre looking for and our needs/desires in a potential relationship. We‚Äôre both in our early-mid twenties and lesbians, not that it really matters. 

Yesterday, I opened up about having Bipolar letting them know how I process my emotions, why it‚Äôs important to me that someone I date knows this and understands what bipolar is (my last partner thought bipolar and BPD were the same thing and they were a psychology major‚Ä¶), and also asked them to think about this to reflect on whether or not they want to date someone with bipolar.

They‚Äôve been so receptive and empathetic to this point, so I was expecting a comforting reaction. As assumptions tend to be, that was a bit off course. Instead, they told me about how they have always had fears of ‚Äúgoing crazy‚Äù (their words, not mine) and have anxiety around the thought of ‚Äúgetting locked up‚Äù. They don‚Äôt suffer from any severe mental illness, so I guess this comes from a combination of societal messages and the fear around existential thinking.

ANYWAYS, they further went on to say that they could not be a person to support someone in a manic state of mind, basically. I wasn‚Äôt expecting that, I am very independent and try to seek my main support through my therapist and safety network I‚Äôve built, but I‚Äôm worried that this person will be afraid of me if I do ever have a manic episode while dating.

Is this person safe to date? what do you look in a partner to be supportive of you? ",bipolar
"I‚Äôm extremely susceptible to religious/spiritual mania. Help! I‚Äôm trying to ground myself right now as I type this.

I tend to identify as agnostic, leaning towards atheist, but I grew up Catholic. I find my mania is usually kicked off by some kind of spiritual event.

The first time I noticed this happening was last year. During my sophomore year of college, there was a joke on campus that a cult-like frat summoned the demon Furfur. I fully bought in and was terrified. I prayed fervently, hail-Marys over and over. I didn‚Äôt go to class, but I did go to my college‚Äôs career fair that day where I tracked down my friends and warned them of the demon on the loose. I calmed down by the end of the day, and in the morning I had to send out embarrassed apologies to all of my friends who were very scared and startled at me, their typically level-headed friend, warning them of a demon in the form of a deer come to burn down our school.

Now, today; I‚Äôm at work right now. I work in an office so I was listening to a podcast while I work. One of the podcasts mentioned a book listing many demons and what they do called The Lesser Key of Solomon.

Immediately, I found a pdf of the book on my phone and dropped what I was doing at work to read the whole thing in about 10 minutes (I‚Äôm a fast reader naturally and the manic-high made it even faster). I decided I wanted to try to summon one of the demons in the book for personal reasons. I researched the demon and made a plan to summon it to get what I desire from it. I even applied to get approved access to a restricted demonology subreddit to get advice on summoning it.

I‚Äôm shaking, my vision feels ‚Äúextra clear,‚Äù quick heartbeat, etc. I feel embarrassed that I totally fell for another spiritual manic episode. Does anyone else go through this?",bipolar

"Has Anyone Else Sandbagged Their Own Life? When I was in highschool I didn't really care about going to university. I had one place in mind and I didn't even try very hard for the application, even though I thought I really wanted it. When I didn't get in I sunk into a deep depression, sometime before or after I found out I was missing a credit and wouldn't graduate with the rest of my class. There was some shock and then later terror and more depression, but never resolve to change it. Never foresight to see that coming. No attempt to try multiple different programs.

I also somewhat understand my actions now as someone who was passively suicidal. I didn't just not care about my future, I had almost no plan and when that didn't take I wanted to crawl under my bed and die. For years leading up it was like I had no future. I struggled in school like many others but I had skills. I wanted to be a filmmaker. For reason it always felt, especially now in hindsight, more of a fantasy than a reality I could live out.

Over and over again I tried to restart my life but I would just abandon my plans. I never had to be afraid of going homeless, but suddenly now, years later, I'm afraid of so much more. I'm buried on guilt and shame, and fear that I'll be alone forever, or on the street, or insane. 

Where was that fear before?

Is that all that motivates people?

I was convinced people hsd genuine hopes and dreams...and maybe I was just broken down way before I had a chance... I don't know how to talk about it, or relate to anyone around me. I felt more in good company at the psych ward. I relate more to addicts and the homeless but you'd never know it looking at me or the life I've lived. People probably think I'm just a big loser or a weakling. The few who've heard my story know how deeply wounded I am. 

Maybe that's all I have left?

"Diagnose Hi! I‚Äôm new to bipolar and am interested in hearing about hearing your guys‚Äô journey to getting the diagnosis and proper treatment, along with any advice or answers to some questions!! 

I met with my psychiatrist and they prescribed me a medication for bipolar II typically I think, although I feel like he didn‚Äôt really listen to me during the appointment and kept rushing it. Looking at the after visit notes they weren‚Äôt that accurate either and had things that we didn‚Äôt discuss or things that I said the opposite of. I‚Äôve been to my primary care doctor and neurologist and everything comes up normal for that, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism along the way and got prescribed a medication for that. But my primary care doctor said he doesn‚Äôt think what‚Äôs happening is due to hypothyroidism because it‚Äôs been happening in relatively consistent episodes. I have a few other questions and I‚Äôm just wondering because sometimes just googling things can be difficult to gain answers. 

Do you guys have a consistent schedule sort of with episodes? For example, I tend to have 1.5-2 weeks where I‚Äôm perfectly ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and then a depressive episode for 10 days (practically always 10 days), then can‚Äôt sleep and hyper for about four afterwards. The pattern seems to be pretty consistent too for the past few months and I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs common / consistent with bipolar.

During your depressive episodes do you guys experience disassociation / depersonalization / derealization? That‚Äôs mainly all of what mine tend to consist of and with a general feeling of sadness and feeling like I want to cry.

Are you guys easily suggestible during a depressive episode? One of my friends called one of my cats fat as a joke because they love to eat. Then the rest of the episode I thought my cat‚Äôs sides were bulging and she was gonna explode sort of. I was able to somewhat calm myself and tell myself it wasn‚Äôt true, but whenever I looked at her that‚Äôs what I saw. Until the episode ended and I realized she was perfectly healthy weight and her sides weren‚Äôt bulging at all and she wasn‚Äôt gonna explode. 

I couldn‚Äôt find the ‚Äúpending diagnosis‚Äù flair when I searched for it. Sorry, this is my first time making a post to Reddit!! I appreciate any answers from anyone that‚Äôs comfortable, no pressure in providing any at all!!",bipolar

My only manic symptoms atm is a bit of restlesness sometimes when a task goes sideways but that could easily just be autism too. Other than that I am ofcourse paranoid in thinking that this will not last.

My wife is a very messy sleeper. Lots of Sounds, big arm movement, nightly visits to loo, but still I don't dare imagine the diffrence is that huge in my life quality. Is it too good to be true and I just happen to upswing? Or did I just stumble upon something that explains my chronic fatigue despite being well medicated. Time will tell.

"Had my first paranoia, happened after a nightmare The whole story is long so I won't get into detail, I'll give a bit of context and get to my question.

So a few days ago was the first time I experienced paranoia and hallucination. Even though I'm not in that state anymore, I'm still feeling the aftermath: anxiety, derealization, mood stuff basically. The episode lasted around 10 hours and involved the police and an emergency pass in the hospital, but in the end they didn't hospitalize me because I didn't have insurance (!) so I have to deal with the emotional dysregulation by myself now. Here's what I need to know:


Is there something I can do to kind of forget and cope with those scary things that happened? My therapist suggested art but when I tried to paint what I was seeing I was so scared to even look at them on paper again. And I kind of need some general support because when I searched about paranoia everywhere people talk about the chronic, more subtle paranoid thoughts so it's not really helping me.

"Child is scared of me I (35f) was diagnosed in 2020. Prior to that I had a lot of struggles. Especially with parenting. The reason I sought a diagnosis was because I was terrified of hurting my kids (9m and 10f). It‚Äôs been over seven years since I even spanked either one, because I was afraid id snap and hurt them. Ever since then, it‚Äôs been a loss of electronics, grounding, extra chores, or going to my moms for the weekend (she‚Äôs a churchgoer and doesn‚Äôt believe in kids having tech). 

Their dad and I have been divorced for nine years. So this is all they‚Äôve known. We coparent very well. Myself, my ex, and my husband are referred to as the Tribunal of Parentood when it comes to any decision about the kids. It‚Äôs worked well this whole time.

I‚Äôve been having issues with my daughter though. My daughter has always been a daddy‚Äôs girl. Whenever we give the kids the choice to go by their dad, she jumps on it. 

Last night I sent her dad pictures of her room, as we have before to communicate about how they are doing with chores and taking care of their things. I asked him to speak with her about it before they got back, as I was really upset. I found my shoes, clothes, makeup, and office supplies from my home office, all over the place, along with food and drinks, garbage, and broken objects strewn about. It‚Äôs unlivable. As far as my belongings go, she‚Äôs never asked, she just goes in my rooms and takes what she wants. She destroyed my foundation, concealer. New sponges ripped apart, bent and cleaned out both of my mascaras. If she asks me, I let her, but I go get it back. 

When she got back last night, her dad said she didn‚Äôt want to come home. She sat in her room crying that she couldn‚Äôt breathe and hyperventilating. I sat with her to calm her and guide her out of the attack. She kept saying she‚Äôs so sorry and she‚Äôs so scared. I asked of what. She said she‚Äôs scared of me.

Hi,

I'm 21F, and I feel like sharing how I feel because I‚Äôm not sure anyone around me would truly understand or even want to listen. Nobody seems to get me‚Äîespecially my mom, who I unfortunately have to live with for a long time. She‚Äôs ill, possibly with bipolar disorder and other illnesses, and, sadly, she‚Äôs made me a mess. Maybe even messier and angrier than she is. Yet she still doesn‚Äôt understand me.

I have a loving boyfriend who tells me I'm the most wonderful woman he's ever met, that I‚Äôm beautiful and kind, and that he‚Äôs never known someone as pure as me. But I don‚Äôt see that. He doesn‚Äôt see the real monster I feel I am‚Äîthe ugly, flawed person I see in the mirror, the face I can barely stand to look at. I hardly ever take pictures of myself; I avoid mirrors as much as I can.

We might get married one day, but even then, I feel haunted by the fact that I never met my father. He‚Äôs even more of a mess than I am. Who would walk me down the aisle? I don‚Äôt have an uncle. I can‚Äôt even face my best friend and tell her I‚Äôm not who she thinks I am.

I feel like a failure, like I‚Äôll never be ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I rely on medication to stabilize my mood, and I may have to take it my whole life. My therapist doesn‚Äôt seem to care about how I feel‚Äîshe‚Äôs only concerned with my mom‚Äôs wellbeing, never mine.

Am I not important? Not to my dad? Not to my mom? To anyone, really?

I don‚Äôt even know what I love, or what my favorite color or dish is. I don‚Äôt know who I am or what I want to do. I feel empty, unable to put words to anything. I can‚Äôt even cry.

Sometimes, I don‚Äôt even feel like my diagnosis is accurate. I feel messier than just ‚Äúbipolar‚Äù‚Äîlike I have an illness no one‚Äôs ever identified. It‚Äôs like I have maggots crawling inside me, eating me from the inside out, and all I want to do is tear my skin open to get them out.

But I can‚Äôt self-harm, because if my mom found out, she‚Äôd just call me crazy, a failure. And with her heart condition, it could even be dangerous for her to see me that way.

I‚Äôm scared of death, too. I don‚Äôt believe in any religion, so I have no idea what comes after. What if I‚Äôm already dead?

My most recent relationship (nov/23 - jun/24) ended poorly. It was also my first real relationship. I broke it off because I relized I could not meet his needs and only felt guilt and shame when I was around him because I had an extremely low self esteem. When we started dating, he got his shit together and I wasted my time. In addition to that, I would go long periods being distant with him, then try to make up for it with acts of kindness or treats.
Love bombing became a major and horrible habit for me.
None of it was intentional and I truly cared for him, but I felt so much relief after I broke up with him.

During that 7 month relationship, I was undiagnosed with what I now know is Bipolar Disorder, which seemed to line up with the love bombing.

Looking back, I still did care for him, but not once when I said I love you did I mean it the way he did, and I relize now I still can't tell the difference between strong platonic love for someone, and attraction.

When he confessed the way he felt, I told him I felt the same way, because I do, but I fear I'm doing the same thing again. 

I never dated in high-school and have no desire for anything besides close platonic physical contact with anyone I have ever known. 

I'm medicated now, but extremely irregulated and emotionally volatile.
I'm terrified that if he sees me as more than a friend, he'll see the kind of neglectful asshole I am because I'm too absorbed in my own problems to care for another person.

I want to be normal, I want to have normal reactions and thoughts and feelings. I want to be able to go on normal dates and be normal around friends. I don't want to feel like I am a different person every single day so I can have stable relations with others.

"Coping the best I can The past week I have reverted back to old coping habits. (because of obvious and personal reasons). I have been feeling guilty, and yet I am finding relief. I started sh again and picked back up on ciggs. I understand these aren't good, but there is a darker alternative that I am keeping at bay. I mainly feel empty and shut down, but I am not being destructive in ways that effect the outer world of my life.



Anyone else have these moments in life that aren't directly related to an episode? I mostly feel alone in this experience. My therapist has been greatly helpful, but I have been wanting solidarity in talking to other people who have Bipolar.

there's several reasons why this will never work political family and age and other things and I'm borderline terrified right now 

reflecting on myself the past few days I'm realizing that I haven't been sleeping well and I think I might be manic and now my anxiety is through the roof and I think im spiraling.

"Considering Genetic Risks and Parenthood with Bipolar Disorder? I‚Äôm almost 38, and after 18 months of trying to conceive‚Äîwith one ectopic pregnancy and an unsuccessful IVF round‚ÄîI‚Äôm doing some serious reflection. My doctors tell me I could still conceive naturally if I keep trying, which I believe is possible. But I'm pausing to really think about what‚Äôs best, especially with my family history of mental health.

Mental health issues are strong in my family. My mom has bipolar schizoaffective disorder, my dad has narcissistic traits, ADHD, and ASD. Growing up with two alcoholic, mentally ill parents meant any genetic predispositions my siblings and I had were bound to be triggered. As for me, I live with bipolar disorder, ADHD, and PMDD, and my siblings struggle with ADHD, ASD, OCD, anxiety, and depression.

I'm in a happy, healthy relationship, living in a different country, financially stable, with a life that feels...almost idyllic. And yet, the thought of passing on a genetic predisposition to mental health disorders haunts me.

So, I‚Äôm genuinely curious:

* Did you inherit bipolar disorder or other mental health conditions?
* Have you had children who inherited similar challenges?
* How has your family navigated the ups and downs if you‚Äôre parenting with a mental health history?
* Is there a reliable genetic test for bipolar disorder?

I‚Äôd love to hear your stories and advice‚Äîespecially if you've been down a similar path and had to decide between using an egg donor or moving forward with your own genetics. Thanks in advance for sharing!",bipolar
"Nobody left to turn to I was relying on my mother in law for emotional support but she went into the mental hospital recently so I feel like she can't handle it anymore. My sister is on medication that makes her non responsive. My mother is a drug addict that can't be bothered to answer her phone. My dad is busy dealing with his mentally ill wife. I don't want to put my emotional crap on my kids and my husband is the root of most of my emotion.

When my husband says things like ""I can't leave you because I'm afraid you will try to kill yourself again"" or ""I've been dealing with you being a bitch for 17 years"" or says he can't do it anymore and that we will end up divorced after the kids are out I can't stop thinking about it.

I have nightmares about us fighting or him leaving me or there's an affair and I wake up feeling gross and mortified.

I don't have my driver's license so he has to drive me to and from work. We fight before and after work sometimes and when I have a bad day at work I feel like I'm going to break.

I am on medication and I made a therapist appointment but I missed it so now I have to wait till the next one in 2 weeks and I don't even know if that appointment is going to be enough to help.

Since I don't drink alcohol and don't take any other drugs, I can remember everything and knew that the evening was relaxed so far. When I got home and was lying in bed, I started derealizing, which I didn't notice at the time.

I don't mention any names in it either, my friends thought it was funny at first and thought I was taking the piss. I listened to it again a few weeks later and asked my friends to delete the voicemail, which they did. My Friends confirmed that I did Not harass anybody that evening and everything is Fine.

"i feel bad and is it my fault? ive been burned out for almost a month  I 21m I've been working on our college capstone project for nearly two months. As a software development student, I've been almost sleep-deprived while developing our web-based system. Our group of four, unfortunately, has been unbalanced. While I've been solely responsible for the system's development, my three teammates have been assigned the relatively easier task of documentation.

Feeling immense pressure to meet the project defense deadline, I completed nearly 80% of the system on my own. Exhausted and overwhelmed, I decided to step back and let them take charge. I assigned them the remaining tasks, hoping they would step up. However, they ended up hiring someone else to finish the system, which still isn't complete.

Now, they're asking me to finish the project, and I'm struggling to find the motivation. I feel guilty for leaving them, but I was truly exhausted after two months of relentless work. I've tried to help with beta and alpha testing, but my energy levels are still low.

Recently, I scolded a groupmate for making a mistake, and I'm feeling guilty about that too. I worry that they're blaming me and talking negatively about me behind my back.

"Very nervous this morning I haven‚Äôt driven very much in the last 2-3 years, since my first manic psychosis episode. The last 2 weekends I took our new to us jeep on the interstate with my husband in the passenger seat. The first time I made it about 20 miles before I pulled off at a rest area to swap with him because my hands were shaking so bad and my heart was racing. This past weekend I managed to make it a lot further on both days, but my hands still shook badly. I offered to drive about 30-45 minutes south of us to get meat from the butcher shop we use. Alone‚Ä¶. I plan to take the interstate but if it‚Äôs too much for me there are backroads I can use that I‚Äôm pretty familiar with, but I won‚Äôt have that safety net of my husband. 

I just had to take a shower alone. That‚Äôs stressful for me. I have PTSD as well as Bipolar 1 and being vulnerable in the shower is scary for me, but I did it. But now it‚Äôs made my nerves very frayed for the driving I have to do in an hour. My husband did take the jeep to work so that I could use the Camry which has more safety features and is easier to drive and has way more power to get up to speed when getting on the interstate. So we have mitigated my fears as best we can.

Anyway I just wanted to get this off my chest. My family and friends do not understand what a big deal this is for me, or just how bad my anxiety is. Even my own 29 year old son who just was home in June to help out with a severe episode that had me hospitalized, replied when I told him about my first time driving in years, he says gee mom it‚Äôs almost like you drove for years.

"Just diagnosed with bipolar 2 yesterday  Hi everyone, I'm not sure if this is the place to post this but yesterday I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and I don't really know how to feel. It's currently just a blocking of realization I think. I woke up this morning thinking no that didn't actually happen.

 I luckily have a therapist and psychiatrist who have helped me and can but it still feel kind of alone. 

The only person I know of who had bipolar was my former partner and she would say I should go get evaluated because it sounded similar tho she had bp1. I can't really go to her for help or support anymore but I know she used to go on here for support and help so I guess that's what I'm looking for. 

I always suspected I had it but just the fear of being told I did or facing the fact that's it's not something I can fix on my own was what stopped me. Also the constant change of medication she had to go through and how it affected her always scared me because depending on what she took would affect her very strongly. 

In summary I don't really know how to move foward or what the best option or what it's going to look like because I don't know anyone anymore who's been through it. As scared as I am, I acknowledge that this has progressively gotten worse and affected my mental health, life choices and relationships in such a terrible way that I need to get help.

"Dropped out of school  In July I had a manic/paychotic episode. I was hospitalized for a month and recovered well. I was still hypomanic when I decided to register for a college program. Primary Care Paramedic training at a local college near me. I had thought about becoming a paramedic before and when I found the program it felt like it was right. I signed up pretty quickly and began school in October. I studied for a month and was doing very well. I was acing most of my anatomy and physiology tests and completing all homework on time, I also didn‚Äôt miss a day. 
I got the flu and missed two days of school and when I went back I had a quiz that I got 50% on. This triggered me to start thinking about dropping out. I convinced myself that the program wasn‚Äôt the right thing for me to do right now and I withdrew from my studies all in one day. 
Part of my decision is made because I am not sure being a paramedic would be a healthy career for me. I think the long shifts and stressful workload could potentially worsen my illness.
I also believe I could‚Äôve done great in the program and could have become an excellent paramedic. 
Now I‚Äôm falling into a bit of a slump because no longer do I have something that gets me up every morning and I feel confused about what I‚Äôm going to do with my life. 

The victory is that I didn‚Äôt get charged for the program so I only lost 500 bucks for the registration fee and a pair of boots I bought for my practicum. 

I‚Äôm just looking for some wise words and support.

"How did you suspect you were bipolar? I‚Äôll start, I‚Äôve always been a bit of a difficult teenager but nothing out of the normal really just pretty reckless like sneaking out constantly, hanging out with people that I shouldn‚Äôt and smoking weed starting at 14. When I was 17 is when I started realizing something was not right up there. For a period of time I fully believed that there were secret cameras that were watching me at all times, in my room, in the bathroom and everywhere I went so I believed I had to act perfect because well I‚Äôm always being watched. Once I got over this I realized something is definitely not right, I would also obsess over things like what I had done in the past and it would send me into a spiral, my mom was worried and suggested that I see a therapist or something which I didn‚Äôt do of course. 

What made me finally get help was when I had my first full blown manic episode that lasted months, in this time I knew something was wrong bec I didn‚Äôt feel real, was VERY reckless, did things I would NEVER do when stable and it‚Äôs like I became a whole other person, I lost my morals, my way of thinking, I became very outgoing when I‚Äôm normally a shy person and practically messed up my life in the matter of 4 months, then that ended and I fell into a big depressive episode, I finally realized everything I had done and I felt horrible I couldn‚Äôt even believe it, I didn‚Äôt even want to live, I was disgusted of the person I had become. This being my first manic episode where I was destructive, I knew something was wrong but I didn‚Äôt know what or how to fix it, so I let my mind take over. It took me a while after that to finally get help, when I did I got diagnosed bipolar. Now I go to therapy and take my pills.

"How do you deal with the fallout after a manic episode? I‚Äôm home from my first grippy sock vacation after a bit of a whirlwind manic episode. This is the first time a lot of the people in my life have seen things at it‚Äôs worst, and it was a work colleague who took me from work to my doc (in complete embarrassment, he actually spoke with his psychiatrist mother about my behaviour and she gave him an action plan to keep everyone safe). Admission was intense, and my partner was called in to be there with me. Which.. well, it‚Äôs really changed everything in the relationship. She‚Äôs heard things I otherwise never would have shared simply because of just how dark or disturbing the dialogue is.

Now everyone at work knows what‚Äôs going on, my partner can‚Äôt see me in the same light, I have said and done a lot of things I can‚Äôt take back, all of this on top of an empty bank account and a damaged body courtesy of hitting substances far too hard.

"My husband thinks I‚Äôve lost all my emotions.  


I‚Äôve found out some pretty disturbing news in the past year and *I really don‚Äôt care*. I‚Äôm functioning well and my house is clean which is something I‚Äôve always struggled with. Our relationship is stronger than ever. Even my dog is more snuggly! 

He‚Äôs worried because I don‚Äôt really talk to my family anymore. My sister is busy with a new job. My niece and nephew are in the teen/young adult phase so grown folk don‚Äôt really exist. My parents have sunk deep into the American political world so I choose not to speak to them so I don‚Äôt get dragged in. They all sound like legitimate reasons to me. 

We did discover that I have another sibling though. It was eye opening but honestly not shocking. I know everyone kind of lost their minds and I was just‚Ä¶meh. I didn‚Äôt make the decision. It has nothing to do with me really. They want to meet me but why? There have been these kind of bombshells all year from spare siblings we didn‚Äôt know about to major medical diagnoses. Heart attack, mini stroke, to a cancer scare. I‚Äôm still waiting to hear about that last one. We find out this year if we‚Äôll be moving next year which will mean a total upheaval of our lives. A change of not just jobs but continents. 

**And. I. Don‚Äôt. Care.**

That can‚Äôt be healthy. But do I want anything to change? Do I want to lose my mind the way the rest of the family is? Do I want to fall into an existential crisis by questioning my parents almost 50 year marriage? Do I want to stay up worrying about how the rest of my family will take it if we lose that family member? 

Yes I know I‚Äôm probably more detached than I should be but what other choice is there? I don‚Äôt want to start screwing with my meds. It took too long to get me here. And is all that mental drama worth it when I really like my life as it is now? Yes I miss my highs. I miss my creativity and the fun I would have. But this way I don‚Äôt fall into those depressive episodes where I can‚Äôt get out of bed for months at a time. 

I don‚Äôt want to feel those things but I also don‚Äôt like scaring my husband.

"Worried about dependency  So I was just prescribed a sleep aid medication that is also a controlled substance and on top of that I take a mood stabilizer, antipsychotic, and a benzo. I‚Äôve been bad and didn‚Äôt take the antipsychotic for the last 2 months because I was worried about the side effects after having a bad experience with my last antipsychotic. 

My sleep problems started last week so I ended up starting my antipsychotic in the hopes that it would help with my sleep issues. Didn‚Äôt really help so went to see my doctor and she recommended a sleep aid. I don‚Äôt mind taking it, but after reading the pamphlet it says for short term use and it runs the risk of the dependency. Should I be worried? I always over analyze any medication I take and worry about the long term effects. I am bipolar type 1 and had my last manic episode in June that landed me in a 2 week hospitalization. Just wondering if anyone else takes something similar and what experience they had had on them? 

My last antipsychotic helped a ton with my sleep problems, but it caused massive weight gain which was the reason I switched medication to a ‚Äúweight neutral‚Äù med (according to my psychiatrist).

"Stable temperatures/weather = less mood swings? Hi team!

Anyone else noticed they have less mood swings when living in a place where the weather is more stable throughout the year?

Context: I live in Argentina. In my city the temp amplitude during the whole year goes from about 1 degree celsius on the coldest days of winter to around 42 degrees on the hottest days of summer.

In 2018 I moved to Mexico and lived there for two and a half years. The annual temp amplitude in Mex goes from about 6 degrees celsius to around 27 degrees.

After I came back to Argentina, which was during the COVID19 lockdown, I noticed myself longing to go back because I remember my time in Mexico as a time in which I was generally more stable. Of course my mood would go up and down depending on what was happening in my life, but I remember I was a happier person in general.  
My low moods weren't as low and my high moods weren't as high. I was genuinely happy but I never felt it was due to mania, it never got dangerous. It was also much easier for me to take better care of myself: I showered more often, I worked out, I ate healthy food. Here in Argentina I can't really make myself do those things even if I'm currently on meds that are better for me than the ones I used to take when I was in Mexico.  
I used to have more energy, I did more things that made me happy everyday, I took better care of my dogs, I was way more productive and actually enjoyed my life beyond my 9-5. I went out with friends, I streamed games online almost every day, I went out shopping or to eat, I was a really active person.

I don't feel like the lockdown had anything to do with my lower mood, since after it was over I was still unable to go back to the happy person I was before, even considering I'm now in my home country which means I have more friends, I know the city, I'm close to my family, it's easier to make new friends, it's easier to find jobs, etc.

Of course being the BIG DEAL that it is living in a foreign country, there are many other factors that might have played into this, but I really think this temperature thing had a lot to do with it. 

Has anyone else noticed this also? Thanks!",bipolar
"Do your mania symptoms change mid episode? So I was crazy hyper sexual and had other symptoms of mania.

"Dealing with guilt during episodes  Hello,

During my episodes I often feel a lot of guilt. Particularly when I‚Äôm in my lows. Today I had to go home early from work. I felt this physical as well as mental fatigue (I‚Äôm not sure if, you, also feel it in your body as well as mind). 

The night before I was feeling extremely emotional for no reason. When my partner got home from work I could not stop crying or explain why. I had been in a low for a while but not quite this openly emotional. Usually my lows are in my head, and I don‚Äôt have outbursts (at least not in front of others). 

Anyway, after leaving work I had this enormous amount of guilt. I felt upset with myself that I had to leave. I felt stupid and angry that this illness can impact my daily performance. My partner picked me up and took me home, but he had to go to work. I was literally clinging to him and crying. He had to go into work, which I understood, but I just felt this incredible deep sadness within. The rest of the day went so fast.. I had all these plans to self care, structure a routine for the rest of the week to help get me through.. but it‚Äôs like the day flashed before my eyes and I didn‚Äôt accomplish anything.

How do I not feel guilt for going home when I know I‚Äôve reached my limit? 

I also feel this guilt when I‚Äôm hypomanic. I‚Äôm a very avid runner and like to exercise, but when I‚Äôm in these mixed or rapid cycling states, I get very agitated. I‚Äôm always feeling the need to do something and I want to do it, but I cannot mentally push through to actually do it. Then, I start to feel angry at myself and even more irritated if I don‚Äôt go out for a run, or if the run isn‚Äôt as great as I expected or anything.

I saw here on the bipolar channel many posts about self-guilt, which I struggle with it too. About every little mistake, while everyone moved on and live their lives. (search on this channel: past mistake) 

And since I'm changing and taking more care of myself and become a better person, I feel like an imposter often and then I put myself down inside until I get depressed and go to hold habits. But then my inner self is telling me that isn't me anymore, so I'm moving like 2 steps foward and one step back and so on. 

I guess I suffer, because I didn't live my authentic self. 

So I'm making promises to myself today and won't delete this post, like I always do and will read it again, until I mastered it. Actually I will also write it down and hang it on in my bed room. I post it here for everyone, who needs to hear it for themself, too. 

I promise to myself to take care of myself. 
I promise to myself to let stories with open ends just open and move on. 
I promise to myself to allow myself to accept my past. 
I promise to myself to create the best out of me for me, my husband my family, who never gave up on me. 
I promise to myself to let me be proud of myself, even if that means to do the bare minimum on bad days. 
I promise to myself to not be too harsh on myself. (that's the hardest part lol)

School I was wondering when/how you guys decided to pursue a medical leave for university due to bipolar and at what point you felt like it was a good idea to return. I have an attendance accomodation but had to drop a lab because it wasn't practical to miss class as frequently as I was missing. I have several mood episodes per year and mostly depressive ones that can last months and don't even know what sign would indicate being well enough to return would look like if I took a medical leave. I'm trying to weigh all of my options so I can finish out my degree strong.,bipolar
"How does bipolar affect your relationships? I am newly diagnosed. I finally came to terms with my mental health when I made a new friend and things went to shambles almost immediately. I lashed out and can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. We were only friends for two months. I‚Äôve been thinking about it longer than we were actually friends. Worst part is she was a horrible friend to me. The last time we hung out the whole time she just said she wanted to leave and she told a girl at work that I didn‚Äôt like her for lord knows why. I even tried telling her I was in the hospital before coming into work and she blew me off. 

I quit my job out of the blue because I almost killed myself before going into work. I am severely depressed. I keep going back to drugs. I lay in bed all day every day. Every time a sad song comes on I cry in traffic. I want to die. 

Does bipolar cause anyone else to obsess in their depression? Do you lash out at people for the smallest disagreement or inconvenience? ",bipolar
"Some thoughts a few months back I‚Äôm paranoid.

 I‚Äôm scared every decision is getting me closer to somewhere I don‚Äôt want to be. Every thought is over thought. Every choice is confusing. I‚Äôm nervous. Financial burdens are heavy. Would I feel a sense of comfort with 30k in the bank? Possibly. Is the anxiety building to prepare me for my next difficult action?     
  Will I accomplish any goal I wish to achieve? Does a higher power watch over me? I hope. I want to trust in something bigger, but I feel a devilish presence with each confusing step in a different direction. A donkey sees two barrels of bay in opposite directions and doesn‚Äôt question which one is closer. 

The moment a human is placed in between the two barrels. The human begins to question which barrel is closer. I can‚Äôt let the world see me weak. I am timid to admit my shortcomings. For the wrong person with the ideas of my truest self will have over me a wrecking ball which could be dropped at any moment. Powerful intrusive thoughts that I will never be good enough. I have fallen before and that is all I may do. Even the strength to lift 100s of pounds will never be enough. I must relax and calm my flowing mind of negative thoughts, for I am not weak, but careful in my judgement. I want to floss and brush, as to sleep beautifully. I pray my nightmares or dreams will improve. Is the past but a torment onto a weak mind? Help me remain calm and positive. Ever pursuing the goals, I wish to accomplish. I hope the things I desire are worthwhile. I crave beautiful, elegant, wonderful memories. I will continue to benefit my health with whole foods and water. The things I deem important now may not be as crucial as I believe.

"Do you disclose your disability to an employer?  My new employer was pushing me for an explanation because my work wasn't up to her standards and I ended up sharing that I struggle with bipolar disorder. Was this a mistake?

"Outbursts? Hey everyone. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with type 2 for several years now but have had the symptoms since I was very young. 

Lately I‚Äôve been in the worst financial stress of my life and it‚Äôs had me in a pretty constant crisis mode. I live alone and pay all my own bills and I‚Äôm not making it. Since my life hasn‚Äôt been going well, my symptoms have been much worse recently. I‚Äôm having episodes where I‚Äôm deeply uninterested in things and feel the weight of the world on my chest and I can get agitated and take things the wrong way and get really worked up going through a series of strong emotions. 

My partner and I had an important date night this last Sunday and I spent the whole day in a very low state. I was catatonic during the date and then went from crying to upset back and forth on the way home and the rest of the night. 

That said, have you been in similar serious life situations and noticed your episodes were worse or have you had outbursts where you took everything the wrong way and took it out on those around you? 

My partner had someone tell her this outburst I had sounded more like BPD but my whole family has bipolar and these type of outbursts under stress are something I‚Äôve experienced and seen first hand.

I‚Äôm freaked out at the thought of having a different illness and I‚Äôm partly hoping to hear that others can relate so I don‚Äôt have to worry about the wrong diagnosis but I‚Äôd also just like to hear others experiences and maybe learn some ways I can approach situations like this in the future.

"Life is nothing but a lie Around january 2023 I started feeling slowly but steadily down. By that time I had been sober (alcohol, used to be a train wreck) for a year and some, had gotten my shit together in uni and was actually doing a shit ton of courses per semester and passing them all with stunning grades. Was working a job that I really enjoyed and was somewhat related to my career. I had a shit ton of friends and felt so very loved by them all, I was filled with gratitude . By that point (january 2023) I'd also been in a relationship for like a year and although it was a very toxic one and he ended up being a vile man, to me being in a relationship felt almost surreal since I had never been in one before, not once in my life, and I am in my mid twenties. Over all, I was doing good. So good. So fucking good it felt a little bit like a dream. 

I thought sobriety was responsible for my achieving all of this stuff in only a bit over a year. Prior to all this, I was a living hell- a raging alcoholic, unable to work, useless at uni, with two attempts on my back and a long history of sh. It was a nightmare. I of course knew I was going through the longest depressive episode of my life, but after all of this improvement I was certain that things had magically gotten amazing the moment I stopped drinking and went 100% sober and that alcohol must've been the cause for all of the stuff that I had to go through before.

It had never occurred to me that there surely must've been a reason for me to finally stop drinking out of the blue, almost no effort at all, after so so many failed attempts. 

Turns out it was all just a manic episode. All of it. All of the good things, the extraordinary things, the stuff that people would've never believed I was capable of had they not been there as witnesses.

And then january. It all started with a sudden habit of overreacting towards minor issues. Feeling a little bit off. Kinda sad. You know, it happens to all us.
Next thing I know, in only a matter of weeks, I was on a mental health leave from work, unable to communicate, alienated at home all day long doing nothing but uncontrollably sobbing and feeling as if the world had ended for no fucking reason at all. Soon after that I started drinking again.

Then came november 2023. Got better. Again.

A new job, one that I am absolutely in love with. Broke up with the guy and realized how damaging the relationship actually was. Kept on going with my career, as good or better than before the downfall, and this last march even started a second one that I also excell at (academia is very important to me). Friends. Social outings every weekend. Flirty but cautious, just having fun. I could drink like any other human being out there and had no issues with self control.

And then, couple months ago, I felt it again. Almost down to a T.

It all repeated itself. All of it. I once again find myself on a mental health leave, barely managing with the few courses I didn't drop this semester and absolutely fucking hopeless. Last week I spent the entirety of my savings on alcohol and shit.

I am so tired.
It's all a lie. The life that one builds for oneself. Doesn't matter what you do, how good ir gets- they're all the city of Troy and will inevitable burn to the ground, it's only a matter of time.

"How do people with bipolar have kids? I (23F) was diagnosed with bipolar II after a lifetime of suffering with severe depression. I go through long and severe phases (as I‚Äôm sure many of you do) of depressive episodes, characterised by my lack of showering, brushing teeth, doing laundry, cleaning my room, leaving the house, eating, etc. However. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm reasonably committed to my own general improvement; I try to create routines, I do therapy once a week for years now, I‚Äôm medicated, I stay away from drugs and alcohol for the most part, and I generally try to do things that will serve me and help my mental health, whenever I can (whenever I‚Äôm not severely depressed). 
One day, though, I want to have kids (ideally at least 4, but we‚Äôll see when we get there). I‚Äôve thought about the fact that my kids are going to be at a higher risk for developing bipolar because of my diagnosis, but I always thought that if they ever did, I would be really good at supporting them and I think it‚Äôs obviously not worth not having kids at all (in my opinion). 
But my question is this: how on earth do people who struggle with bipolar the way I do (especially the depression) manage to keep their kids healthy and happy when they can‚Äôt always do that for themselves? How am I meant to feed my kids several times a day when I sometimes can‚Äôt even get out of bed? How do I keep the house running smoothly when I currently can‚Äôt even keep up with my own bedroom and laundry? It might be a stupid question, but I‚Äôm really interested in seeing what any of you bipolar parents (maybe mothers specifically, because I‚Äôm a woman) have to say about the struggles of being a bipolar parent. Like, the way my life is now, considering my capabilities and limitations, I don‚Äôt see how it would work that well for me.

Lately the past 8 months I‚Äôve been in and out of doctors appointments, I‚Äôm talking all sorts. Without going into much personal detail (I don‚Äôt want sympathy) I‚Äôve been in widespread chronic pain these past 8 months with little relief and no diagnosis yet. I think they‚Äôre getting close? I hope. The challenges I‚Äôm facing of not letting my frustrations out on people who don‚Äôt deserve it ie doctors (I had a bad experience when I was 12 in the hospital for a week or so as well as experiencing some issues with standard of care currently imo) 

I finally did a few things for myself regarding relationships with other people and it has helped lift some weight I didn‚Äôt know I had. I always give away my happiness. I‚Äôve been by exes therapist for a few years after our splitting ways, we both genuinely cared about each other and kept in touch frequently. I just didn‚Äôt want to do it anymore, to me it is so frustrating to watch someone suffer when they don‚Äôt have to especially when I am doing it practically 24/7 and would do anything to get back to a different time. I told her how I felt about her abusive bf, how I felt about her( still have feelings) and how she was better than this situation and that she needs to start respecting herself if she wants to stay in touch. Not as a way of getting her back, but as a way of setting a boundary. Her and I are much alike in our perfectionism and unwillingness to let others settle for less. It‚Äôs a long story and maybe I‚Äôm the asshoke.. They‚Äôve not been together to long and I told her time is of the essence the longer she waits the harder it will be. The last thing she said to me right after we got off the phone was a text from her Mom saying not to call her back (we joked about me calling her back and pretending to be a different guy) I realized I don‚Äôt want to be on talk with limitations anymore. 

Anyways that‚Äôs the tip of the iceberg. I always tell myself it can get worse to spark a desire to live in the light, and it has consistently so I‚Äôm glad I had the right mindset.

However, I have almost 0 interest in living life, feel almost blank and disconnected. I started a medication for bipolar 1 depression and it's been almost 2mo and I just don't see an improvement. I'm not living, I'm surving each day until I can take my meds and sleep. The constant brain racking intrusive thoughts have been better but I still struggle with lingering suicidal ideation. No plans just back to going ""great I woke up again this morning, fantastic."" 

I have no interests, I've shut out all my friends (can't get hurt if you dont have friends!), and just live with this day to day apathy. 

It's overwhelming as well as I take care of my disabled mother and work Healthcare. I moved my mom in after she lost her place and I know it's hard but I wish I had some help. I hate coming home to dishes and the house a disaster. Laundry not done, no towels, I do Basically all the chores including cooking and cleaning after my long hours at work. 

I'm burnt out. I've tried explaining g to my mom I'm struggling badly, but as she doesn't bring in an income I have no time to get myself better or we lose our place if I didn't have a job to support us. 

I just want a little help. Can't just blame my mom my brother in his 20s doesn't do much to help either. And if I complain my mom says passive aggressively that my brother sees me as more as a mom so puts all the responsibility on me. 

I'm just tired but I have no time to break down. I just want a little help before I completely burn out. 

Thanks for reading my discombobulated ramble folks. Have a good day! You are all beautiful and amazing ‚ô• ",bipolar
"I'm scared this illness will kill me soon (TW: suicide) I'm NOT in crisis and I'm NOT currently suicidal. this is just something I worry about a lot, especially recently.

I'm facing the possibility of losing my Medicaid. If my partner and I lose our coverage then half my income is gone because I'm his home health aid. I have a part time job on top of that, so I wouldn't be making nothing, but getting a second job or a full time job is not an option for me. I'm currently reliant on my mom for housing, and I fear that I always will have to. My medication is very expensive and I don't make nearly enough money to pay for them without full coverage. Without my meds I run a very high risk of killing myself. I have a couple of months supply, but  just a couple days without them and I crash hard. So, the thought of losing our Medicaid scares the hell out of me. I know that the marketplace is an option, but I'm afraid even a normal laps in coverage could be the end of me.

I'm terrified this illness is going to take my life, and sooner rather than later. I don't want to die.  ",bipolar

"Got handcuffed and put on psych hold  So I had a minor surgery about 3 weeks ago that made it hard to sleep. Lack of sleep goes hand in hand with my manic or mixed episodes.
 
I slept on average 3h/night for 2 weeks, after the first week of very little sleep, I had a lot of signs of mania that I of course didn‚Äôt notice. It got progressively worse to the point where on Halloween I felt like a switch flipped. Everything got super creepy and terrifying around me. I felt like there were people or entities in my walls that were going to get me. I had the lucidity to know something was not right and that I needed help, but my body fully believed the paranoid thoughts. So my heart rate was going insane, total panic. 
I called 911 and they sent behavioral health over to my place, I had to ask 911 to reassure me they weren‚Äôt coming to execute me lol. It‚Äôs my first time in the US calling emergency services for mental health so I did not expect what came next. 

They told me I needed to go to hospital, but that the police had to bring me there, not them. Next thing I know, police handcuffs me and I go in the back of the police car, and stay in those handcuffs the whole journey to CPEP. Plus an additional 45 minutes waiting alone in the car, on the super creepy parking lot. What a great combo when you‚Äôre paranoid af lol. I lose my shit and yell for help bc I feel so threatened despite there being no danger. Police finally lets me out of the car and allows me to walk while my ¬´¬†room¬†¬ª was being prepped.

Well that room was a padded cell like in the movies, all grey with the awful super aggressive white light. After more waiting, I got the shot in the butt and only then was I released from the handcuffs.

The positive is that the shot got rid of the paranoia and the mania. I was able to be released the next day.

"Advice for someone with a late diagnosis Hi everyone, I (33F) have just been diagnosed with bipolar and I'm starting to see a lot of my life in a different light. I don't really have anyone to talk to who has gone through this, and would love some advice. 

I want to stop hurting the people around me with my erratic behavior and unpredictable emotions. I am already doing the following:

\- Therapy 

\- Eating healthy and correct number of calories

\- Exercising (gym several times a week)

\- On antidepressants

\- No alcohol because my reactions to it are increasingly unhinged

\- Sleeping early and getting enough sleep

"I cut off my best friend And I hate it. 

She struggles with her regulating her emotions, understanding and healthily displaying them. (for example, when she would get upset, she would throw things at people, scream, hit etc).

Then she would come to me in a panic. ‚ÄúHow could they ever forgive me, I‚Äôm a horrible person, They hate me.‚Äù She would assume I‚Äôm mad at her for any reason (like if I take too long to reply). I‚Äôd clarify that I‚Äôm not upset and she‚Äôd say ‚Äúso you don‚Äôt hate me???‚Äù We had a long talk about it and even after that, three different times I had to ask her to stop saying that because I felt like she was undermining the 4 years we were friends.

We had many talks. So many things give her anxiety. Example: she‚Äôd text me crying and panic over something at work, but was too scared to message her manager who fix the problem. She‚Äôd want my input, find a reason opposite of my opinion, then go to someone else (ex: mom) who would say the same thing as me, then come back to me and say ‚Äúmy mom said xyz so i‚Äôm okay now.‚Äù

She would start therapy and stop and start. She made a plan with her therapist (that I had no idea about until afterwards) that when upset, she‚Äôd come to me to calm down.

It felt like every day she was upset. And every time, she came to me. Which is fine, but I felt like my well wasn‚Äôt being replenished as quickly as I‚Äôd buckets of my water for her. She was more of a ‚Äúyes man‚Äù who would try to hype you up but never knew what to say or how to help. The moment that snapped in my mind was when I was crying upset and I was texting her. In the middle, she started talking about her favorite celebrity who had just posted. She did apologize and said her sister scolded her bc she does the same thing to her. 

I tried for a month to stop being so angry. I talked to her about the situation, I distanced myself for a while, I talked to others. I wanted to stop being so upset, but I realized that I‚Äôm upset because she isn‚Äôt able to give me the support I gave her. And that isn‚Äôt her fault. I want her to be somebody she isn‚Äôt.

So let me start by saying they haven't informed me yet, however it's in all my recent health documents that I have a diagnosis of BDII and am getting separated from my job with a diagnosis of BDII as the reason.  I have an appointment with my psychiatrist on Wednesday which I'm sure he will let me know then.  I'm a 33M in the Military.  This diagnosis separates me from the military.

Anyways, I am depressed most of the time, but I had gone to Hawaii for a few weeks and the weeks leading up to it I got heavily involved with Fortnite and spent a couple hundred dollars on skins.  Then I blew a bunch of money in Hawaii on car rentals, going out, a new tattoo, among other things and got heavily involved with Warhammer 40k when I was back I wasn't sleeping (due to printing miniatures on a 3d printer I bought a similar event happened) felt like I was vibrating out of my skin and couldn't sit still my last visit with the Psychiatrist.  He told me it seemed like a hypomanic episode.

My question is how do they know it's this?  I've had them say I suffer from GAD, Depression, ect.  I've been on multiple meds that made me worse and have similar events happen on them (one even leading to hospitalization which I think is from the meds I was on).  I'm currently on some different meds and it seems like it's helped since the hospitalization. I feel like they are just throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks,  how can I be sure that this time is right and they aren't uprooting my life for a thing that hopefully sticks to the wall this time?",bipolar
"Post bipolar I had a great life before my first episode. Finically sound, GF of 6 years, nice retirement saved up, great grades in an engineering degree. Great job lined up. I had one manic episode and it cost me all of that. I gambled away over 100k. Took out my retirement, took out two bank loans and lost all that too so now I‚Äôm around 80k in debt. My girlfriend left me. And I was in psych ward for 50 days.  

I am losing my job due some behavior issues from a blackout episode and was homeless for a couple weeks until I found a family willing to host me as I watch over their pets. I lost all my friends as a burned all those bridges and feel so incredible lost. I‚Äôve lost all interest in anything I use to like and have kept trying new activities but nothing is sticking.

"Voluntary admission (+rant) What‚Äôs y‚Äôall‚Äôs experiences with voluntary admission?? I‚Äôve only been admitted once and it was because I made an attempt the day prior and went to the er the next day because I was vomiting blood. I ended up being admitted to three different units in 2 days. I was then admitted to my final hospital for a week and a half, then had to do a 3 month long IOP following.

I‚Äôve been having a really rough couple of months and winter is always the hardest. I dont plan on admitting myself voluntarily until January (just so I can finish the fall semester and get the time off from work). I can‚Äôt afford to just drop everything again but I want to get the help I need. I‚Äôm worried if I go too soon they won‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ‚Äúmessed up enough‚Äù but I also don‚Äôt wanna wait until it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôve already spoken to my psych about my rapid cycling, my acute hallucinations, my depressive episodes worsening, I asked for a meds change and because of my instability the last few months and not seeing her for so long she rightfully denied a meds change. I don‚Äôt see her for another 3 weeks, and I‚Äôm gonna ask her again. I had a moment of crisis after doing a drug I will not mention here on Saturday. Luckily, after some cold fresh air, a lot of crying, a cigarette from a kind stranger, and my partner talking me down and picking me up, I was functional again. But I realized I‚Äôve been slipping up a lot lately.

During mania I‚Äôve been going on weekend benders, doing drugs and drinking even though I shouldn‚Äôt, emailing coworkers and managers picking up shifts I‚Äôm so confident I can do and then immediately the depression hits. I‚Äôve been oversleeping and missing my afternoon classes, coming to work late, foggy brained and exhausted while on shift. Once again doing drugs and drinking even though I shouldn‚Äôt, but I‚Äôd rather feel what I feel inebriated than how I do sober. The back and forth is just killing me.

My moment of crisis also made me realize I surround myself with so many people. I have friends, I have people who care about me. But I feel like such a burden in those moments because it‚Äôs like everyone is going through their own things I don‚Äôt wanna push my shit on them too. Crying and freaking out in the middle of the night sitting in a park, scrolling through my contacts and feeling like I can‚Äôt talk to anyone is crazy. I was going back and forth on calling my mom but I didn‚Äôt want her to worry about me, she thinks I‚Äôm at my happiest right now and shit I should be! I‚Äôm engaged, I have 4 loving pets, I‚Äôm in school, I have a job, i have friends and I party and hangout with people and yet I‚Äôm a mess. A literal mess. 

I‚Äôve already spoken to my partner about it. He agrees I should go to the hospital, it‚Äôs just a matter of figuring out if going voluntarily will be worth it. I‚Äôve done a lot of research on the process, and the hospital I wanna go to has a number for voluntary admissions, I just would like to know what others experiences are doing it as someone with bipolar disorder. 

Update: ty all for the tips and encouragement!! I plan on talking to my psychiatrist about going to a hospital and hopefully she can get me a bed at a good one even if it‚Äôs not the one I initially wanted to go to üôèüèª I will keep yall updated on my plan",bipolar

For context me and my girlfriend have started to be sexually active (this is our first time with anyone) it was mostly just foreplay but there were times when I could feel the hypomania spike and it genuinely felt like I was losing control of myself at the moment like all my inhibitors just got cut loose, fortunately I was conscious enough to pull a grip on myself.


I'm just genuinely so so so glad nothing bad happened. She found it enjoyable and she thinks I was just really eager but now that I'm a bit more conscious I fucking know that was not a case of just eagerness 


My current sleep schedule would most likely be to blame for this (I've had to pull multiple late nights due to school) and I'm definitely going back on my meds again for the time being.

"Embarrassed and Guilty About Getting Acedemic Accommodations I wasn't sure where else to post this, but I was on this subreddit about bipolar being a disability the other day, which I only just found out.
I am diagnosed with Bipolar 2, PTSD, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I have recently gone back to college after a 5 year gap of figuring my self out, healing, and getting my mental health under control.
Besides the overall culture shock of how different college is, it has been a huge trigger for me as well because of some trauma I dealt with the 1st go round of college. I'm also living back in my childhood hometown where a lot of abuse happened to me. It is affecting me a lot more than I thought. I'm going back into therapy and trying to cope/work on it, but honestly it's been so hard to function day to day. I'm constantly exhausted (even in my manic episodes, which I have terrible insomnia during which perpetuates the exhaustion cycle), been crying non stop, a panic attack once or twice a day when I try to leave the house.
I realize that my mental health situation is teetering on the edge of being really bad again if I don't do something about it, especially because my grades are also suffering. I think academic accommodations would help significantly, at least short term, but I feel guilty about it. I find myself down playing my situation/bipolar episodes and thinking about people with ""real"" disabilities.

"Depression/bipolar and bpd worst after finding a job Hello, everyone. This is the first time I‚Äôm posting on Reddit about my mental health situation because I don‚Äôt know where else to turn. Those who know me just tell me to go to work, saying that it will help me feel better, but I‚Äôm not feeling that way.

I have borderline personality disorder, bipolar II, chronic anxiety, and depression. Most of my days are spent at home and have been for almost a year. I worked one job, but I quit after two weeks. Then I had another job, and they let me go after two weeks, and I don‚Äôt even know why. This last one took my depression and suicidal thoughts to an extreme level, as I still don‚Äôt understand, even nearly two months later, what I did wrong.

I started looking for a job, but my mental health kept getting worse. However, in the society we live in, it‚Äôs unacceptable for someone to simply turn down a job just because they don‚Äôt feel right about it. I‚Äôm an adult, so I should just be happy, right?

The problem is, I‚Äôm not happy. I don‚Äôt want to get out of bed. Knowing that I‚Äôm supposed to start work on Tuesday has made my mental state worse ever since I found out a week ago. At first, I didn‚Äôt even want to tell anyone I‚Äôd been accepted because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I could go through with it. But I ended up sharing, and now everyone around me knows, so I can‚Äôt just not go.

Nobody understands why I feel this way or why, physically and emotionally, I simply don‚Äôt want to start this job. I‚Äôm not mentally okay, and everything about this job terrifies me. I genuinely don‚Äôt know what else to do. There‚Äôs only one day left, and all I do is cry because I just want to stay in my own space alone. I can‚Äôt bear the thought of being in a public-facing role again. The idea of new colleagues terrifies me, and other aspects of the job itself don‚Äôt appeal to me.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, so I decided to post here in the hope that someone who has been through something similar can help me. I know, on paper, I should be happy, but I feel even more miserable than before.

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this.

"Welp, it happened **NSFW: drugs, sex, rough night**

Hi everyone, I just need to vent to someone who might get it. 

Haven't had a hypomanic episode in years. I've been going to this bar for years now. Yesterday I got my normal drink and I got a message saying a friend who worked there died. He fell off a ladder, broke his neck, died instantly. So I cried, and I met people and we cried and hugged and that should've been it, I should've gone home. 

But no, I got this sense that I have to live! Went to the ATM, got cash and hit the strip club. I started to feel the hypersexuality building up, the inhibitions going away. Spent money on two bottles, girl tried to get me to spend more...but I remembered this other girl I used to like who blocked me but works in the area. She blocked me because I wasn't spending enough on her and I was in a mood to spend.

A friend called her, she unblocked me and the goddess appeared, I spent like it's the last day of my life. Champagne, blow, shisha, more blow. Unprotected sex with whoever. 

She kept wanting more and I couldn't stop. The sounds, her smell of vape and perfume, it was intoxicating. 

Then.... Clarity hit. Like a punch to the face. The hypomania was gone, the hypersexuality was gone, the girl was in my lap and I was DISGUSTED with myself.

I never thought I was a bad person but after last night, I don't know anymore. It wasn't money I couldn't afford losing and if I told a normal nightlife person about it they might actually be jealous.

But I know that I had no control, I know that I could've died from alcohol poisoning. I know that I didn't care about protection, I know.

I'm sitting here after taking my meds and I don't know how to continue living... I'm gonna get tested in a few days and I'm not going back to that place. I only drink when I'm outside and it's time to stop drinking.

"I am spiraling down down down  I just got diagnosed bipolar like five months ago. Started taking meds and was allergic and just haven‚Äôt been on meds since.

I didn‚Äôt fully believe I was bipolar until now  

Last week I was energized and cleaning and excited and starting new projects

"- one med = + orgasms I‚Äôve been on medication since 2017, when I was first diagnosed, and honestly, it‚Äôs been a huge help. I'll never stop taking them. But recently, my doctor started tapering me off one of the meds I‚Äôve been on since the beginning because it's not meant for long term use and I've been taking it for almost 7 years, and something unexpected happened.

I‚Äôve been with both men and women over the years and had some amazing experiences. But now that I‚Äôm off this particular anxiety medication, everything feels‚Ä¶ different.

Even though I‚Äôm by myself, my orgasms have reached a whole new level. I'm talking gasping, eyes rolling back, ears ringing. The first time it happened, I was actually a little freaked out. I‚Äôve always been sensitive, but this is something else. I still can‚Äôt quite believe it and it's not something I can stop. I've tried. Every single one of them is like this.

It‚Äôs something personal to tell anyone I know irl, but since we‚Äôre all kind of in the same boat, I thought maybe some of you would understand.

"When did you know your feelings were real? So I am really trying to understand myself and I thought I might need some help.

I've been manic for at least eight month now...I think i am a little more calm since september but i am still going trough the motions and and i am not sure about my emotions. i red a lot about other experiences but its hard for me to see that in myselff..

how did your feelings from before the episode come back and what happened to the feelings you had during the episode? I am not sure if i am fooling myself sometimes... sometimes i feel like i want to reach out to some people...especially to my ex girlfriend because i miss her...but i dumped her during this episode again...but then i feel like i have to distract myself from these emotions and end up meeting strangers... 

please can you give me some insight about your experiences? I hope to sort my thoughts like that somehow.

when did you know what was real and what was not real? when did you know you did things because of mania? how did you handle the regret and guilt? what did you do to get more stable?

how long did it take for you after the episode to be able to think straight again? Logical stuff is not an issue but emotions are so confusing and strong for me...",bipolar

I first experienced psychosis in 2022 and it was the scariest/most embarrassing time of my life. I was in a reality that wasn‚Äôt my own. I wouldn‚Äôt even feel comfortable sharing what I thought because I was so far from reality it‚Äôs even taken me time to admit in therapy. 

After a little grippy sock vacation, coming out of the psychosis in complete denial, and the aftermath of coming out of the manic stage and into the worst depressive episode I‚Äôve ever had in my life, I accepted that that might be the case and, very timidly, told my therapist/psychiatrist I think I am bipolar. Then I admitted all of the things I kept from them. 

What a weight it‚Äôs been off my shoulders. While I still feel a little ashamed, I took the steps and made myself vulnerable.

"My friend is avoiding me ever since I revealed to her I was in a mixed episode For context, I have BPD and Bipolar. This is not just some friend to me, this person is my FP(Favourite person). I got into a mixed episode 2-3 weeks ago where I alternate between feeling manic(with psychotic symptoms like paranoia and mild hallucinations) and feeling depressed at the same time or feeling either one in a rapid sequence. Or just feeling stupidly irritable. I revealed to some friends after ranting on and on while feeling the high rush of mania and from my excessive talking about the fact that I was in a mixed episode. I didn't want to reveal to anyone that I had BPD or Bipolar let alone currently experiencing a mixed episode. But one day, I impulsively called my FP and overshared about what was going on. I ruined it. Ever since then, it feels like she is avoiding me.

"This isn't who I am. Or is it? I'm deep in hypomania right now. I've never experienced any euphoria with my hypomania, it's always a dark energy, not positive. I am so wired and anxious and agitated, it's truly miserable. It reminds me of being electrocuted. 

I just want to scream, and the smallest, stupidest things threaten to set me off like a bomb. I am tempted to yell at people I love for crazy reasons. I'm tempted to hurt myself. I'm tempted to implode my closest friendship over a perceived slight and then obsess over it for days after (oh wait I actually did that). I'm tempted to spend all my money and call out sick from work and start crazy fights with my husband just to have somewhere to direct all of this horrible energy. But those actions aren't me, they're wrong, and I don't want to do them. I grew up with a bipolar dad who turned into a monster when he was manic. I don't want to be a monster. I am a better person than that. Or at least I want to believe I am. 

One shitty part about this illness (among many) is how fucking hard I have to fight not to do horrible things. It makes me feel like deep down, I¬†*am*¬†a horrible person and that's why this all comes out when my illness flares up and my defenses are down. Like, this is who I really am, and it's the nice version of me that's the fake. It's such a hopeless feeling.

"Coming down from mania? I am so confused Hi everyone,

I just got diagnosed but it seems i had many manic episodes in my life before. I thought i just had mood swings, did not understand what was going on and why i felt so different about the same thing depending on the day... Last year I had an severe manic episode that lastet for month - started in spring and during the summer and it did not end until november and even then i still experienced mood swings. I had a lot of stress so I never really hat the chance to come down maybe. i think i was only better in february and march before i got hypomanic again...

this year i feel like everything startet all over again. again in the spring time.  i dumped my gf again although i know sometimes that i really love her, had random sex which i regret and i still feel like i am not really myself...i finally made the decision to see a psychiatrist and had a meeting with a therapist but all of this still feels strange to me. i feel like i have to distract me going on dates but i dump them after seeing them once...

i would like to ask you: how did the come down feel for you? my therapist told me that it can take month after the peak to come back fully to myself but i am feeling so confused. how did you know that you were back to your old self and how did you understand your emotiones? did old emotions just come back like that? i am not sure how to feel about certain things anymore. and the guilt...i am afraid of that. i think it will get worse. did you reach out to people to apologize? did that help? i dont know how to talk to my ex gf anymore as i put her trough so much pain but sometimes i really miss her and i think it was a mistake. how do i know if i am still manic? i feel like i will forget what i felt one moment during the next. i know it takes time and i havent started medication yet (but will soon) but i hope to get some answers. thank you!",bipolar

"Mourning our shadow selves Good morning, fellow time-traveling, meaning-making meat machines. I‚Äôm grateful to be here and now, though staying in this mindset has never been easy or long-lasting. I didn‚Äôt choose to feel this way intentionally, but supervised visits with peace feel safe.

I don‚Äôt glorify being bipolar. It‚Äôs life or death. I‚Äôve been under continuous psychiatric care since I was 16, I am almost 40 now, and I‚Äôm fully medicated and in therapy. I‚Äôm working to heal, grow, and become a more fulfilled version of myself. This path feels lonely, but knowing others share similar experiences is comforting.

Peace has been elusive, as I‚Äôve tried to know my way through self-actualization when I should have been feeling my way to self-acceptance. I‚Äôve spent too much time running from my demons instead of facing them with compassion. A paradigm shift seems crucial for paradoxical problems like these.

At 16, reading Nietzsche, I lashed out at my mom, telling her I needed to separate myself from her mediocrity, only to find myself restrained in the ER and then hospitalized. Befriending broken adults, including an elderly suicidal doctor, was a strange initiation into this journey. Returning to high school felt surreal, like I was living on the surface of myself to avoid the depths.

Since then, I‚Äôve lived in fear of my own potential, labeled myself as ‚Äúdamaged goods,‚Äù and numbed my approach to life. This detachment only extends the depression and sense of inner deadness. I‚Äôm realizing what I‚Äôve needed all along is not going to come from the next self help book but from the new mindset i am cultivating.

 Because of my diagnosis I‚Äôm aware this is a manic episode but I genuinely don‚Äôt know who to talk to about my near constant violent and sexual thoughts. It‚Äôs very bad. I keep wanting to attack people. I keep wanting to fuck people. 

If I contact the supports they‚Äôll just put me in some kind of facility until I wind down. There‚Äôs a huge difference between someone who broadcasts that they want a fight to appear tough and the person who broadcasts they can‚Äôt stop wanting to fight and need help.

"Fell in love for the first time as a 39 year old . . . . . . And fucked it all up in about 2 days as my mood shot to the moon.

Was diagnosed late teens.  Took about a year and a hospital stay for me to accept it.  Been fairly stable since then, always took meds and have avoided triggers.

Turns out one trigger was hiding.

I like the ladies, but Ive always felt Id be the ball and chain.  So Ive avoided that part of life.

Then a week ago a wonderful girl came into town for one of my friend's family gatherings.  She looked at me and stole my soul!  We flirted a bit but I was trying to resist it like I had others before.

But I couldnt stop thinking about her (not lustful, just about how much i wanted to get to know her).  So later on I got her number and texted her.

She admited she was flirting with me and I was floating - little did i know straight into manic behavior.  I ignored that the next thing she said was she was sorry, but she had a partner, it was a mistake etc.

Nope straight to shes the only one and a constant torrent of overly emotional, over sharing, super inappropriate sexual texts.  This poor lady had this manic garbage thrown at her for 2 days before she finally had to beg me to stop.

Turns out (and i know through the grapevine this is true, unfortunatly) she suffers from anxiety - and boy was I helping.

I stopped texting, and she has probably (and i dont blame her!) blocked me.

When I came out of it (with plenty of deep depresion to go with love sickness (which is real I found out) I sent an explination/apology with no reply.  I didnt really expect one and Im not about to use friends which might make drama for her and we live in different states, however . .

I was so good and gentelmanly all my life, why did i break all of a sudden(the texts included quite alot of detailed discriptions and erm, pictures)?

"Understanding Myself Hello, I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 over the summer right after I turned 18. I've been coping a lot better as well as managing myself but deep down i'm scared.
I don't think I really know what I'm doing and I often question if i'm really okay. I'm kinda expecting to be leaning back in that phase of depression, but right now I feel nothing, or like empty? Since I don't feel necessarily ""depressed"" or sad right now, I also question if this is that phase of ""normality"" as my therapist described it.
Whatever it is, it feels awfully uncomfortable. Maybe i'm too used to experiencing my emotions to extremes, that this moment of ""peace"" is eating away at me? I hope this makes sense. Can someone give me advice? Or is able to relate?",bipolar

so this year comes around and I am asking my mom for the paper to take to my psychiatrist again to fill out to have it extended (I also have underlying health issues im currently seeing doctors for). my mom knows that my psychiatrist is only in office two days out of the week, I have been seeing him for 9 years. my mom promised me multipletimes that I can stay on her insurance until im on my feet and finish school and get a good job where I can afford health insurance- without me even asking her. I and SO BEYOND GREATFUL for her because of this and I remind her everyday honestly. 

however two weeks ago she brings it my attention that her insurance is changing and she has till nov 8th to receive my extension letter from BCBS filled out from my doctor. I currently cannot get ahold of my doctor and have left voicemails. 

I have tried to refill all of the medication I can, but im extremelyaffraind of what could happen is I loose insurance and cannot be on my medication. I have been on these meds for 10 years and have been stable and im scare of what could happen without them.

Now before anyone assumes I am prone to think about infidelity or to think about cheating I'm not, it goes against everything I believe in, for example growing up as a child my father was commonly cheating on my mom, and both physically and verbally abusive to myself my mom and younger brother. So needless to say all of my psych providers have agreed that my dad being the way he was when I was younger is where the start of my mental health issues are rooted. So needless to say I'm 31 now I do not keep in contact with my father since I was 18. So I was very close to mom, and even at 31 my wife and I lived with my mom for financial strains reasons and my mom passed away this past March and I've noticed my behavior and mental health overall has gotten much much worse.

"Does it matter if I'm diagnosed with BP1 or BP2? After my first and only manic episode one year ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. However, after spending time in subreddits and other self-research, I'm really confused as to why I was given BP2 and not BP1. I experienced psychosis during and I was hospitalized for it. I was diagnosed when I got out of the hospital by my university psychiatrist, who basically wasn't there for any of it lol.

Now, I know official labels don't really mean that much, it's moreso if one's symptoms are being treated correctly. I've been taking daily antipsychotics since the hospital and have had only 1-2 very minor (hypo)manic feelings since, so I guess it's mostly been kept at bay. But would there be a benefit to being ""correctly"" diagnosed? I feel like keeping the bp2 label is going to reduce problems down the road (shoutout to ableism and stigma /s). But I also don't know if I'm screwing myself over by not getting reevaluated.

Would appreciate hearing from anyone, especially if you have personal experience with being misdiagnosed as the ""wrong"" bipolar type! Thanks :)

"I'm just a kiiid and life is a nightmare  

Title is a joke as I am unfortunately 23 years of age.

Hi so this is a burner, but I just needed to vent a little and maybe get some advice.

I live at home with my parents. I was diagnosed at 18 and before that I dropped out of my senior year bc of the symptoms I was encountering like a year before I went to a psychiatrist. After like four years of having a psych that in the end didn't even think I had bipolar (bc when I went to get another and my files were given to them, I was only listed as having depression/anxiety even though she explicitly diagnosed me with bipolar in 2020), I've been struggling to get my GED so I can actually, you know, be independent and live my life. I have a lot of shame surrounding it but I try and do my part with my family and be as grateful as I can for even having a place to stay at all.

The problem is that my dad is an alcoholic. He isn't physically abusive but he can be emotionally abusive and belligerent when drunk. I've been dealing with this since I was nine. He got a DUI in 2020 and ended up in a jail cell. Was sober for like nine months, then tried it again to see if he could take it.

Anyway, I've been biting my tongue lately even though he's recently lost his job and is stressed. But he gets drunk every night, per usual, and tonight he collapsed on the floor and I found my mother, who's currently experiencing a bad Crohn's flare up, trying to help him. I really couldn't do it anymore. I yanked him up and cursed him out, told him he was an asshole and ""fuck you."" 

I'm seeing my new psych next week and I hope to god that whatever medicine they give me works good so I can get a job by January at least and get myself out. I just wonder if anyone else has been in a similar situation/has advice? Because I've felt alone about it all these years, and it just makes me feel even more singled out as an already very mentally ill person.

"How is sick leave handled in various countries? Mostly out of curiousity, figuring out the ""state of the art"" of managing bipolar disorder in the workplace, and what the ideal approach to sick leave might be...

If dealing with performance-impacting episodic illness where one only realises what happened once it's over, e.g. manic episodes, and one cannot retroactively take sick leave for the previous two weeks (this I imagine to be typical, but I didn't try hard to seek special case possibilities), it can be hard (impossible?) to have sickness taken into consideration in performance evaluations.

Under a system like that (which might be most systems?), someone with episodic illness that isn't easily self-recognised and reported probably needs some external support for said recognition and reporting.

"Any tips for mania? I'm sorry if this isn't entirely coherent, my brains going a million times faster than my fingers can write and I can't focus. If anything needs to be flagged differently or adjusted for clarity let me know.

"I got some much needed closure today.  So I was officially diagnosed with Bipolar II about a year and a half ago. My PCP was helping me as best as he could, but I needed more specialized help. I ended up in the hospital in an involuntary stay for about a week. After my hospital stay, I got a call from my PCP asking if I needed to make an appointment, standard practice in the US. I was nervous of how my PCP would react to me ending up in the hospital so I declined to go in. 

Now its a year and a half later and I finally go in to see my PCP. I showed him that even dispite the diagnosis I recieved, in a year and a half, I've been able to reach stability through incredibly hard work. Today I also found out that my PCP will be leaving his practice within the next month so I scheduled at almost the last possible moment to actually see him. I also had my weekly therapy session so I was able to process it at the perfect time. 

My therapist suggested I start being a little more open about my recovery journey, but I am not totally confident in sharing with my real-life friends, so thank you reddit community for being there for me! ",bipolar

"Is my existence as someone with bipolar disorder inherently be a burden? I feel like anyone who‚Äôs dealt with mental health issues, especially with one that‚Äôs known for its ‚Äúextremes‚Äù like Bipolar Disorder, often feel like a burden to those they love. If not often, then at least occasionally, especially when after coming down from an episode.

Those who you love, love you too, so they‚Äôll never call you a burden or atleast they won‚Äôt blatantly say it. But you can see the expression on their faces drop when they notice that you‚Äôre starting to do bad again. You can hear the sigh when they‚Äôve inexplicably, yet unintentionally, said something wrong that triggered you again. When they start asking ‚Äúhave you taken your meds?‚Äù Whenever you express a negative emotion. The look of concern and panic on their face when you try to vent‚Ä¶

Even if I stay silent, even if act like I‚Äôm fine, even if I go to some one else for support, or maybe even start journaling, just so I‚Äôm not burdening them with my existence, ultimately I know and so do they, that it‚Äôs only a matter of time until I have yet another episode. 

I‚Äôve never hurt anyone, or at least not that I know of and certainly not intentionally. But I know that simply having to put up with my emotional instability, my over-sensitivity, and the low moods I can get in, are enough to push someone away. Regardless of how much they say that they love you and how they‚Äôll always be there for you. 

I got on Reddit last night hoping to get advice on how to be a better partner/friend/peer while being bp. However all I‚Äôve seen in these subreddits are people talking about how they can‚Äôt handle their bipolar loved one anymore. That after years of dealing with them, they want a divorce/break-up, they want to give up on them. And honestly? I get it, I often bother myself with my thoughts alone. 

I don‚Äôt think I meant to be around people or be loved at all if all I am capable of being is a burden. I‚Äôm sure the only reason I‚Äôve yet to be abandoned by my loved ones is because of their fear that I‚Äôll off myself if they leave.",bipolar
"Can episodes vary greatly in length? Hey everyone!

First time poster here. Recently I have started therapy with my psychologist but they highly advised me to also see a psychiatrist because alongside of some other unrelated  bad stuff, a lot of the symptoms and things I go through remind them of some of their bipolar clients.

All my life I have always juggled between mania/hypomania-like state, depression/extreme depression and some brief periods of stability, but they would greatly vary in terms of length. Half a year I can be what could be described as manic/hypomanic, then it would either gradually turn to depression or suddenly switch to it.
Or it could be mania/hypo for a week, then depression for another week, then mania/hypo again and eventually the episodes would go longer again for no reason.
And again, sometimes there would be some periods of stability (just like rn) for a week or longer.

I already made a psychiatrist appointment for next week. I am just asking if anyone has ever experienced something like that and whether it's bipolar or not I still want to seek help. When I don't feel either manic/hypo or depressed, just this feeling of shame comes because of all the things I did or reacted in certain situations.

Thank you!",bipolar

"What do I do to forgive myself after losing a very good friend. Its all my fault I lost a very good friend and confidant almost a year ago after going into a hyper manic state or possibly psychosis. Maybe both. I need advice on forgiving myself because I've burned that bridge to a cinder and I can't even remember why I acted that way or what I was thinking. What I do remember sounds awful and I can't believe I acted the way I did. The things I was mad about don't bother me usually; not this bad. And some of them didn't even bother me at all, again, usually it's that way. I don't understand why I acted like that some of it didn't make sense.

I had a falling out with this friend of mine around 10 years ago from a similar episode. We stayed in contact but things were never able to reclaim that level of the friendship. We didn't really talk too much anymore but we stayed in contact and we're still friends and confidants.  We've know each other since we were 13. She was an Internet friend that I wanted to meet in person . We've talked on the phone and texted and emailed each other for over ten years now so it wasn't just a random obsession. We told each other EVERYTHING. About our trauma and troubles. We stayed up late just talking about life before I fucked up . It was a platonic friendship but she was one of my favorite people to talk to.

I got mad one day during an episode about how we don't talk that much anymore. I don't know why it made me so mad and I thought I was over with and delt with situation repeatedly and felt like I had moved on from it. I saw she was online and more or less harassed her to get her attention. She was ignoring my messages and told me I was act like a two year old once I went through desperate measures to get her attention by talking to her friends i don't know. I never act like that twords her she asked me why I was acting that way. And I'm not sure why other than feeling sad we don't really talk anymore. But I've never done something like that before. It's never made me that mad. I don't understand why I did it. That not who I am.

she cut me off and I told some of her secrets that she shared with me. I don't know why I reacted so hideously. I would NEVER do that in the right state of mind. But I did and she threatened to call the cops and blocked me. 

I feel so awful for how I acted. I have remorse. I hate myself. I don't think I can win her back. I think she will never speak to me ever again. She was a very good friend of mine and I had trust in her and I violated her trust. I really enjoyed talking to her. She helped me so much. One of the best friends I had ever made. But I'm still having intrusive thoughts that make me think about the situation. I feel like I can't let go and move on. I don't know what to do. I can't forgive myself.

FYI definitely not manic. I've been fighting depression pretty hard, my psychiatrist dbld my meds and I'm on the ups. The issue is, I work 2nd shift and I just don't see a reason to get out of bed until 4 or 5pm. I don't have kids, I don't wanna clean. My partner isn't home to talk to, so I just stay in bed. I've lost all interest in things that bring me joy.

I do have an 8 year old dog. When I'm stable we go on lots of walks, but I have a run line in the back yard so he still gets plenty of exercise. I feel like if I had a puppy I'd have purpose, a reason to get out of bed.

But the reverse coin ""A baby won't solve your problems."" I am a good dog mom already and I feel like adding 1 more isn't that crazy. I've wanted another dog for a year and my friend has a litter of the kind of dog I was interested in already, so it's time sensitive for me to make a decision.

It feels like this could be really good for me, but I'm also super nervous. My friend said I can do a 1 week trial, so that's the plan. (But I think we all know how that ends.) I'm just so torn on what's the right decision. Any advice is welcome.",bipolar
"Two extremes of a psychosis 
So, I got diagnosed with bipolar 1 in the summer of 2023. I got my first full-blown manic episode that led to a psychosis. It was extreme. After that I started studying this disorder, cut off alcohol and started exercising regularly (almost religiously) and made sure I got enough sleep. I was very social, yet I was depressed during the winter and due to a very stressfull spring my anxiety increased. Then I just stopped. I got tired of fighting. I went almost catatonic. Nothing brought me joy anymore and I blamed myself for every inconvenience.  And this extreme depressive state led to a psychosis as well. Although it was like a negation of the first one, when my mood was very elevated. Now Hell got loose.

I went straight to work an internship after I got out of the psychiatric facility and now I am trying to finish my master's thesis. I'm almost done, but I feel so empty often when I am alone and I dissociate a lot and my cognitive abilities seem to have decreased due to these extreme circumstances. My doctor says that recovery takes time, but sometimes I just feel just kind of scared knowing what my brain is capable of. And what it's not. 

Has anyone else experienced a skitso-affective psychosis due to depressive state? I didn't think that could also happen. I was so afraid of mania reoccuring that I fell into another deep end although I tried to do everything right. Does this ring a bell?

Sleep has been 6-8 hours a night for at least a few weeks now, getting harder to fall asleep on time. Feels like I have a moral obligation to give away everything I have to help a cause, cause I can't be helped.

Feeling very off, even more than usual. The strange thing is, I want to destroy my life, and there is no goal that this would accomplish. I just want to do it, stomp out any hope I have left. Don't plan on doing anything after, I just wanna watch myself crash and burn. Not very fidgety, at least not more than usual. Impulsivity off the charts, feeling very angry and willing to fight people which is the opposite of baseline.

What triggered it? it was building up for months. At least I'm not overwhelmed with emotions, instead I just feel like someone slipped something into my energy drinks.

Caffeine has less of an effect than normal. I can't focus on work anymore, money feels meaningless and life feels like a collective charade. 

Does anyone here resonate with any of these feelings?

"Dealing with severe insomnia, please if possible! I‚Äôve had trouble sleeping since I was a little kid and as I got older my inability to sleep worsened. Once I got to high school I‚Äôd often go 24hrs (usually no more than 35 or so hours max.) without sleeping. If I wasn‚Äôt staying up for over 24hrs at a time then I was often only sleeping a few hours a night, waking up several times a night, or had a hard time falling asleep. 

It‚Äôs never really bothered me too much because I was able to function fine without experiencing any side effects of not having slept the previous night. I wasn‚Äôt lethargic, tired, or anything really. But now (in college) my insomnia has gotten far worse. I don‚Äôt even know how many days total in the past few weeks alone I haven‚Äôt slept. The longest I‚Äôve gone without sleeping, consecutively, this month was maybe around 60 or so hours?  And then on other days I‚Äôd go 24 to 30-ish hours without sleeping. 

I‚Äôve already talked to my psychiatrist about it and she and I both attributed the decline in my quality of sleep and ability to sleep in general to the loss of my antipsychotics + having mixed/(hypo)manic episode.

However, prior to my current episode, I was still dealing with insomnia, so my psychiatrist had prescribed me some medication to help me sleep. Due to the nature of the medication, I can only take it for a short period of time and it‚Äôs a controlled substance so I can‚Äôt just ask for another refill. Idk if I‚Äôd asked for another refill anyway because it honestly didn‚Äôt help too much, I‚Äôm not sure if the dosage was too low or what, but it simply just didn‚Äôt effect my ability to fall asleep (what it is supposed to do) very much, if at all. 

I‚Äôve tried pretty much all of the over the counter stuff and now, 3 different prescriptions. I just want to sleep. It‚Äôs gotten to a point where I am beginning to experience painful and uncomfortable side effects of sleep deprivation .

"I'm Okay I paint my smile on carefully each day, 
A masterwork of subtle artifice.
""I'm fine,"" I say, and gently turn away
To hide the cracks that threaten to surface.

My laughter rings like wind chimes in the breeze,
A pleasant sound that echoes empty halls.
While underneath, my heart begins to seize,
As anxiety climbs up these pristine walls.

They see the person I've designed to show:
Collected, calm, a portrait of control.
But shadows dance where no one else can go,
Where darkness fills each corner of my soul.

""You seem so strong,"" they say, and I agree,
While drowning in an endless, stormy sea.
Each compliment becomes another weight
That pulls me deeper into my deceit.

But love compels this daily masquerade‚Äî
Their peace of mind worth every breath I fake.
So I maintain this careful barricade,
Until perhaps, this glass begins to break.

Yet sometimes, in the quiet of the night,
I wonder if they see through my disguise,
If all my careful walls, however slight,
Are transparent to understanding eyes.

For now, I'll wear this mask another day,
Until I find the strength to say ""I'm not okay.""",bipolar
"How to set up safeguards for risky behavior? So! Hello! I'm hopefully being evaluated for bipolar 

Even if I end up not having bipolar somehow, I've been noticing myself having what can only be described as mania/hypomania (agreed upon by a therapist who suggested being evaluated) and I am greatly struggling.

Usually I'm able to catch onto it right away as a low energy human, and it's never affected my life negatively besides maybe staying up too late, extra energy, spending money, or sending risky texts. To emphasize, I've *always* known it's happening, *while* it's happening

Well! Along with some other mental health related crisises that I've been experiencing, these manic/hypomanic episodes have been getting noticeabley worse. I've been making decisions that are very out of character and risky (not nearly as bad as they could be, but still very possibly dangerous) and just literally not noticing until someone else points it out or I have a small moment of being more rational.

I am usually an incredibly self aware and risk averse person. This is terrifying to me, not being able to tell if decisions are good or bad or having the capability to even find out! 

The worst part, is that even writing this, I can almost physically feel the pull to start doing these risky things, my brain is basically saying ""you feel amazing, you feel so energized and confident, how can this be bad? You're just finally on a good headspace, you're living life the way it's meant to be"". 

Going back to the original topic (excuse the backstory yapping) does anyone more experienced have any advice on how to, essentially, keep myself from getting fucked over by these emotions? Any tips and tricks? Any way to incorporate my support system? It's such a unique issue, like asking for help because I'm ""feeling too good"" seems so embarrassing and I dunno what help would even entail?

I'm not scared about it at all, and I know I really would be normally! Even writing this is taking so much effort to sustain a coherent speech pattern üò≠",bipolar

And iv been nothing but supportive and done the best I can threw all her problems she dumped onto me and how I wasent doing/wasent good enough.

"I need my brain back!  Hey everyone, I‚Äôm bipolar and have been experiencing some pretty intense issues with focus, memory, and cognitive function. Initially, I thought these issues were part of a specific cycle, but I‚Äôve realized they stick around even when I‚Äôm in remission (euthymia). I‚Äôm actually off my meds right now, so I figured that might explain things, but I recently read that this can be a common experience for bipolar folks in euthymia.

For a bit of context, euthymia is usually seen as a stable period without the extreme mood swings typical of bipolar disorder. It‚Äôs meant to be a phase of calm without the highs and lows. But even during these times, studies have shown that a lot of us with bipolar still have cognitive deficits, especially around executive function and verbal memory.

It sounds like even in remission, cognitive impairment is a pretty big deal and might be tied to worse functional outcomes, especially as episodes add up over time.

"Would you forgive her? The strangest thing happened to me! Before an important and stressful film project, my then girlfriend, who I loved very much at the time, started interrupting me repeatedly. She offered her help over and over even though I insisted (and later begged and begged) that I needed quiet to do last-minute, but essential work. She later admitted to 12 interruptions over 3 hours late at night: when I needed to do about an hour and a half of uninterrupted quiet work, it was more than enough to knock me off my equilibrium, but it was actually more interruptions than that. 



I slept less than an hour that night because of the interruptions and the drama (of begging, eventually shouting. she just wouldn't be quiet, for whatever reason!) it caused. I still don't understand it! I'm BP1. By the morning I was symptomatic. I later broke up with her -- partially because of symptoms and partially because of the ordeal she caused that night and what I went through during the day of filming on so little sleep. It was a day of severe sleep deprivation and high responsibility, not being able to perform certain things, physically and mentally painful to push through. Even later, with my symptoms getting worse, my doctor had me compose my now ex and her mom an email saying I needed a week to recover in our apartment, strongly recommended we stay apart, and be treated. I had no place else to go. Still, she came over, in spite of having multiple places where should could temporarily crash including a mansion in an adjacent state, to the apartment within less than 24 hours of the email. ""To get some blouses"" she later tells me.  

  
Later, I get worse, the drama continues, and she tried to get the police to remove me from the apartment. The paramedics checked me out and I seemed fine to them. Later, she locked me out of the apartment without notice and her mother tried to film me on her phone while I stand outside of our building. Eventually, I get even worse and I'm hospitalized and while I'm there she gets a Temporary Order of Protection against me because she was worried I would try to come back to the apartment and not leave, and it would be a pain to evict me because I had Occupant rights (she confessed those motives to a mutual friend. not what TOPs are for!). She lied in court that I chased her and her mother down the street. This never happened.

  
Recently, my ex has resurfaced saying she misses me and she's terribly lonely without me in her life and can we work towards a friendship. Part of me has been reconsidering the blame I put on her because I think I may have been slightly symptomatic for at least two weeks before that night she kept me up. My thinking is, ""How can I blame someone when I'm symptomatic. This is the illness's fault..."" Another part of me looks at her behaviors and wonders how they could have been worse? How could they possibly be worse?:

  
She caused a crisis not listening to my pleas for quiet and even if I was symptomatic, she still added fuel to the fire that night. Then directly went against my doctor's instructions. Then locked me out which was one of the biggest things that caused my downward spiral. Then she lies to get a TOP. It's a lot to digest. What do you think of all this? Could you forgive this person?

"Tips for overcoming a depressive episode Long time lurker first time posting. Could use some help with overcoming my depression. BP type one, relatively stable and taking meds regularly.

"Today I felt peace I know it‚Äôs temporary, but today I had a very nice day. Not up nor down. Steady and level headed. Did a lot of responsible things and took care of my body, ate actual food, sketched, read, walked in the beautiful fall weather. I‚Äôve had a really fucked up month and just went back on my meds 5 days ago and they‚Äôre already beginning to give me peace. I feel hopeful I won‚Äôt always be a mess all the time. I also feel hopeful I can lead a healthy lifestyle and not want to be intoxicated 24/7. Who knows. All I know is today didn‚Äôt suck and I wanted to share. ",bipolar
"Does the cycle ever stop?  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD during a tumultuous time in high school. I avoided treatment because I was terrified of taking pills, believing they were meant to hold me back. Things spiraled, and I ended up addicted to various substances. Throughout high school, I managed to hide my struggles behind a fa√ßade of being the quiet, responsible kid in class. The truth? I was using drugs during football games and even classes, only my closest friends knew.

After high school, I entered college and realized that if I wanted to succeed, I had to stop abusing substances. I worked hard to distance myself from toxic influences, even letting go of people I loved. For a while, I felt great‚ÄîI was eating healthy, sticking to a routine, and thriving. But then my ex came back into my life, triggering a severe depressive episode that sent me spiraling after I had undergone a period of abuse.

I sought help and started on a regimen of medications‚Äîeverything from antidepressants to mood stabilizers. I felt like a lab rat, taking up to eight pills a day. Instead of feeling alive, I felt numb, with only occasional spikes in emotion. Ultimately, the combination of meds led to a reckless driving incident that resulted in an arrest, leaving a mark on my record that I can‚Äôt expunge.

A year later, I tried to make the medications work, but they just didn't. My psychiatrist and nurse insisted I couldn‚Äôt stop, so I cut them off and even stopped taking my medications cold turkey. Now, I‚Äôve graduated college (barely) and found a job I love, but I still struggle with feelings of hopelessness and the relentless cycle of bipolar disorder.

Not too recently I looked into Spravato, (which has seen a ton of success) but my insurance won‚Äôt cover it unless I take an antidepressant, which I refuse to do after my past experiences. I‚Äôm searching for alternatives to medication and therapy for managing bipolar disorder. I appreciate my friends and family, but they don‚Äôt fully grasp the complexity of this illness. It often feels like they see me as ‚Äújust manic or depressed again.‚Äù I really need advice on what to do next. Help. :(",bipolar
"I am grieving  Wondering if anyone else feels as hopeless as I do? 

Ever since being diagnosed with BP2, my life has gone downhill. I‚Äôm on a break once again from university, I‚Äôve lost so many friends, and the worst of all is that I don‚Äôt even know my personality.

I don‚Äôt know what I like, what hobbies I could enjoy. It‚Äôs so embarrassing whenever anyone asks what do you to for fun? Because what do I do? 

It‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äújust try a different activity until one sticks‚Äù, but I can‚Äôt ever imagine living long enough to care? 

I had so many huge plans for my future before my diagnosis. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly grieving who I used to be, who I wanted to be and who I could‚Äôve been.

I deserved so much better ",bipolar
"Technique to lower an already low dose Talked to my doctor a few times about how my mood has been on my current medication (very low desire to do much of anything).  

I'm already on the lowest possible dose of my medication.  

I knew I didn't want to switch the medication because it does work to keep me stable and not go manic. 

So between the two of us, the doctor and I decided to give only taking the medications 4 days a week, instead of 7, a try, just to see how things would go. 

So far, I'm really liking the results. My interest in things has really come back. It's like life was in black and white for a while, and now I'm getting color back. 

Just wanted to share with the hopes this technique may help someone else.",bipolar
"Well, I guess it‚Äôs finally time to seek help Later today I‚Äôm voluntarily admitting myself to a psych ward. I feel like it may have been something that needed to happen for a long time but I was too scared to admit it to everyone around me.

I‚Äôve always felt like I was intelligent enough to know when I wasn‚Äôt acting rationally, but I didn‚Äôt even realize that I had been on my longest manic streak of all time. Over the course of the last month and a half, I have proceeded to blow nearly half my savings, most of which went directly to going out to bars every single night and drinking copious amounts of alcohol. And when I say copious I mean that I would drink until I physically couldn‚Äôt anymore as long as I was having a good time. I was ready for anything and everything as long as I could squeeze a little more dopamine out of it. Only got like 4 hours of sleep a night, but was flying so high on cloud 9 that I couldn‚Äôt care less. 

Then I proceeded to do what I‚Äôve always considered to be the most evil thing you can do to someone you love, which was to cheat. This past weekend I cheated on my girlfriend of 4 years that I love more than anything 2 times in 2 nights after heading back out to bars to get hammered until the sun rose. This I don‚Äôt want sympathy for. I view it as inherently evil and honestly unforgivable.

Immediately after came the crash. When I got back in the morning I snapped back to reality and realized that I hadn‚Äôt been myself in a long time. So I sat down in my bathtub empty and emotionless and was finally going to ‚Äúdo it‚Äù. But then I stopped for just a moment and thought about my mom, and what it would do to her if I wasn‚Äôt there anymore.

So I finally came clean to everyone about everything. The over a decade of suicidal thoughts, the close calls, my actions over the past couple of months, and everything from the last few days. Told my family, told my girlfriend (who I wouldn‚Äôt blame for not forgiving me, I honestly do deserve it and don‚Äôt want to make any excuses for what I‚Äôve done). I‚Äôve been on medicine for it since around the time that I was 16, but it‚Äôs been a long time since it was tweaked (27 now), and I should‚Äôve known to go talk to a psych to adjust it, but I didn‚Äôt.

So I asked my family to drive me tomorrow to a bigger hospital than we have in our town in a nearby city where I‚Äôll have myself put in voluntarily to hopefully get some help getting everything under control again. Hopefully it‚Äôll work out.

Much love to all of you who suffer from this too, and if the post isn‚Äôt approved before I go in tomorrow, I hope to be able to talk to you all when I get out in hopefully a better place than I am now.",bipolar
"Friend told me to not listen to psychiatrists There is so much stigma and misunderstanding regarding this disorder here in india, educated people are telling me that it is just a phase, everyone deals with it, you just need to change your lifestyle, I know you and you are not bipolar, don't let it get it in your mind, even when I tell them that my father and grandfather dealt with mental illnesses.

"Flirty flirt hypomaniac  Hi there. I've been on a hypo rollercoaster recently and got a sort of hyper fixation on two coworkers. The older one is  single and today I found out the other one is too. Now I have been getting a lot of attention from the younger one of them, and today this happens: We (a small group of coworkers ) were chatting about cleaning and he said something about his mother wanting to buy some cleaning supply for him ""now that I live alone"", and then he quickly looked at me and smiled like an insecure, vulnerable smile, and the others picked up on it and smiled, looking at me, and then back at him, like everyone knows he likes me. I've been getting vibes from him for a while now, so this confirmed it.
Now, the problem is that I've been hypo for the past weeks on and off, and I think I have been perceived as flirty. And I have been flirting, obviously. Now that my hypo is mostly gone I feel like crap about it. 
I am married, and he and the other guy has been fishing information about me, and my marital status, and not so subtly. I am so scared I'm gonna break this guy's heart. He's like 13 years younger than me and he's single now after a long relationship. He seems like a really really nice guy. I like him, and bipolar hypomaniac me would really want to get into his pants, but medicated, responsible me don't want to ruin my marriage or our coworker platonic relationship. 
So right now I am in some kind of a panic mode.  The rollercoaster is real. Emotions are flying everywhere. Why am I like this!? What am I doing?

"Weather increased symptoms So I've been alot better the past two years, stressors have lifted alot and I live with two great people and two fur babies üò∫... 

Thing is the weather here sucks most of the time, my impulses for shopping have sky rocketed thus making me stressed about my economy. I've been on a long no med round and it's been fine until it was stormy weather with rain for about 8 months with sprinkles of good weather totaling probably one month. 

I was supposed to go to a course for the geogebra program today. I can't I have to take my meds, eventually clean up in my office/ wardrobe room and just not dive deeper into whatever this situation is. I've felt so many of the un medicated symptoms lately but they have increased without stressors and I feel it has something to do with the local weather cycles here.

Is it just me or is the weather more often than not affecting bipolar people ? I also notice it affects me both ways while on meds. But it might just be me that feels moody due to weather, especially the bad kind. I'm looking forward to the snow but cold windy rain is just not my kinda rain...

TLDR;
I have a nice life with little stress, the weather where I live is mostly rain and rapid changes in pressure. Bad weather combined with a med free period have sent me spiralling and now I'm skipping math course class to start back up with meds and to not go lower.

"I had the worst psych appointment today I went to the emergency room this morning and after seeing 2 nurses, a crisis worker, and a doctor, I was referred to a psychiatrist. I spent 5 hours waiting in that hospital room hoping to be able to see a psychiatrist and I was glad to hear that I was finally going to see one, but it was awful and I wasted 5 hours of my day.

I was there because I was having some very serious and terrible thoughts but all she proceeded to do was read the doctor's notes and not give me a chance to actually tell her how horrible I've been doing. She told me all I really needed was to see my therapist and do more therapy even though I've been seeing the same therapist fairly regularly for the past 9 years and that I am already doing group therapy. The worst of it was she didn't believe I have bipolar disorder. I was diagnosed 6 years ago and it was confirmed by 2 other doctors. My meds have stabilized me for years. After such a long wait to see someone all that came of it was being ignored and being given useless advice but at least she changed my meds a tiny bit.

I know that this disorder doesn't define me, but it has changed my life so much and forced me to find ways to survive and keep going. Having that experience disregarded simply because she read doctor's notes about why I was at the hospital and only having talked to me for 10 minutes made me feel unbelievably awful. I know my disorder and what it has done and she gave me one look and decided not to consider that.

She was there to help me in a time of crisis and she never asked me what my crisis was. Instead she ignored me and tried to diminish my history and present problems. It hurts but also makes me so infuriated.

I just needed to get that out because I've never had that happen before. I'm feeling a lot of ways about all of this right now, but most of all I simply feel deflated.",bipolar

"Is it smart to live close to home for college when you're bipolar? I have a question.

My biological dad wants me to stay close to home in case something bad happens with me. He's concerned about my bipolar disorder.

"Bipolar on the NHS - advice I got diagnosed with bipolar type 1 by a psychiatrist when I was in private inpatient 2 years ago.
I can't afford private psychiatric care now so I'm at the mercy of the NHS for medication but I do have private therapy. I keep getting referred to the primary mental health team and then eventually they close my file and the cycle repeats. I've never been referred to the specialist mental health team even though I have a serious mental illness that qualifies me for an early Covid booster every year! I've had one ECG 6 months ago after being on anti psychotics for years which I had to ask for. 
In the past when I have gone to A&E in a mental health crisis or been down to my local mental health hospital for an in person assessment after calling 111 option 2 I don't get any help and usually just get sent home with a diazepam. 
I'm pretty articulate and can advocate for myself and turn up to appointments on time etc. That's my assumption as to why I don't get follow up care or get taken seriously. 
My current situation is that I got referred to the primary mental health team again 6 weeks ago. I stopped taking my bipolar meds 4 months ago during a 2 week addiction relapse caused by out of control mood swings and wanted to start fresh with new meds now I've been sober again for 4 months and have stopped punishing myself for relapsing by not going back on meds. I had an initial appointment with a pcn 4.5 weeks ago and haven't had a follow up because the pcn has apparently been off sick for over 2 weeks now.  No other pcn has picked up my case and the receptionist at my doctors I think essentially lied and told me they had no way of making an appointment for me with another pcn. So I asked for a gp appointment with the Dr that referred me to the mental health team this time instead which I'll have to wait until next Tuesday for because that gp is on holiday this week.

Yesterday I told my psychiatrist just how bad this is getting, how im having ‚ÄúTHOSE thoughts‚Äù and they basically just said ‚Äúif its only a week long every month its better than being in the hospital‚Äù‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt have a plan or anything but I can absolutely see myself just reaching a breaking point and going for it.


But what i‚Äôm always crying about is how living life with bipolar just seems like a joke almost. Apparently mania and depression damages your brain, medication damages your brain. Hearing about people having memory loss and brain fog, people (including myself) losing touch with their personality. I will only ever laugh truly like once a month. The way my libido was shot down and hasn‚Äôt ever fully returned. Trying so many meds that all give me a number of side effects, and knowing that I will just have to deal with some of them for the rest of my life because its better than some others (it still makes me feel like shit a few nights a week, so horribly drowsy. And everynight I cant even breathe through my nose because its stuffed badly) basically suffering still, but I have to be happy about it because at least im not in the hospital!


My life was already a challenge before bipolar, ive been struggling with crippling social anxiety for my whole life, overthinking ANYTHING I say in public/to peers. So thats caused me to hide my true personality because im scared to death of being judged. (I was harassed and made fun of by classmates as a kid for this even though I would do nothing but simply mind my business) And now this is the cherry on top.

The sadness is mixed with an anger as well,
feeling angry and disgusted with my body because of how it cant even do the bare minimum (emotions, having a period every month, have a libido, etc) and I already have a low self esteem without that.


It‚Äôs not that I haven‚Äôt accepted being bipolar, I have, and I don‚Äôt mind the idea of taking medication (if it actually helped with my depression and didn‚Äôt give those side affects) Im just upset and devastated knowing that I will never be fully comfortable physically ever again or at peace. And by the looks of it I will never be able to truly enjoy living. its like being cursed.


And going back to medication side affects and trying new ones its only traumatized me more. I remember throwing up so much, one time to the point I couldn‚Äôt stop. And then the last medication I tried gave me this incredibly horrible unsettling episodes of akathisia where I would go into this dark headspace where nothing in life mattered to me in the moment.

"pregnancy and bipolar 22f and got diagnosed bipolar 1 in 2020. i dont know if i want kids or not for other reasons, but im also scared of the mental aspect 

i saw a post about pregnancy a while ago, and i saw people saying that it messed with their mental health and made their bipolar worse

what was your experience with pregnancy and post partum? good? bad? did it make your symptoms worse ? ",bipolar
Venting The tale end of mania is rough for me. My impulsiveness can sneak through the cracks and I sometimes miss them. My intimacy buttons are triggered and my wiser mind is trying to stay above it. ,bipolar
"Tired of looking for jobs Had to leave my previous job about 5 months ago because the stress alone was enough to make me feel like I was going absolutely batshit most days and I was afraid I was quickly approaching a psychotic break. I've always had a difficult time not letting stress get to me. Since being diagnosed bipolar II earlier this year and starting meds, I'm significantly more aware of how stress affects me but struggling to manage it. I've applied to 100+ jobs, had a good chunk of interviews and only 1 job offer. I feel like I have a lot of good work experience and I've been applying to jobs directly related to what I have experience in but the crap pay and the games employers want to play with candidates just seems more cruel and unusual than ever before. I feel like I'm wasting so much time and the little energy I have for absolutely nothing in return. I'm starting to feel utterly hopeless and angered every time I start looking at job postings. I'm at a point where I want to give up looking for work because it's starting to trigger depressive episodes that I stay stuck in for days. Anyone else in this boat? If so, how are ya'll managing?",bipolar
"Life change, auditory hallucination? Hey everyone! 
I recently got married and I had a very rough day at work today as a nurse, sent someone to hospital and got bullied by an old coworker. Also didn't sleep well last night. I was about to sleep, turned off my bedroom light and began to hear a cat meowing outside my windows then it sounded like it moved to the front of the house. It freaked me out!

My husband got home and looked and couldn't find it. My dogs didn't react to it. 

I'm just confused. I haven't had a hallucination in like 3.5 years (last one was dogs barking at me), and a manic episode in Dec 2020 under severe stress (first and last one), I've been med free maybe since May. 

My friend says it is a spiritual attack , another said probably just a stray cat, but maybe hallucination??

Help.",bipolar
"Mania scares me It‚Äôs been 5 months and I still think about my manic episode all the time. All the insane thoughts that I had, the lack of sleep, the amount of damage I did to my body and to my bank account. I thought I had super powers. I thought I could cure any illness and had the ability to telepathically influence what people do

It scares me. I never want to go through anything like that again. I‚Äôm on medication, but the fact that I‚Äôm capable of doing something like that just freaks me out sometimes",bipolar
"Do you think it is very difficult to diagnose bipolar type II? The problem is that hypomania sometimes manifests itself as irritability, being more sociable, talking more, etc.  
  
In my case I have gotten into sports betting problems, I have had risky sex  
  
and I have spent money irresponsibly  
  
but I have never reached a manic state as such  
  
Is it for these reasons that making a type 2 diagnosis is so difficult?",bipolar
"Bipolar Podcast~  Hey y'all

I've been listening to this podcast at work lately called ""inside bipolar"" and it's just a psychiatrist and the author of ""Mental Illness is an a**hole"" (he has bipolar himself, I have never read the book) talking about stigmas of bipolar and providing insight into what it's like being bipolar and problems we may share. 

I'm not sure if it's been shared here before but I figured y'all might find it appealing. I personally find it comforting to listen too while I'm at work. 

Anyways hope y'all have a good day üëÄ",bipolar
"There Is A Brighter Side  Last year, I cratered my life as I knew it thanks to bipolar. Fiance gone, friends gone, asked to move out of my home, unemployed. Things were looking pretty bleak.

But, things got better.

I got back on my meds, got a job that I'm doing well at. I milked every resource and research option I could. I reconnected with the person who had fallen into the crater of mania with me, and we made things work. Better than work.

And here I sit, a year later after one of the top 2 darkest moments of my life, next to my husband, in our new apartment. Expecting our first little girl within the next few weeks. Both healthy and well employed. We have an ongoing dialogue about our mental health, and how we're managing. I have a wonderful therapist who has graduated me to only having to talk to her monthly. I got my friends back after a lot of healing and dialogue.

It was so much work. The work never stops. It is a constant daily grind to make sure that level of psychosis never happens again.

But for the first time in a long, long time, I'm truly happy. We're planning for our futures in a way that last year felt impossible to achieve.

There is a bright side. And we can find it.",bipolar
"Help! I‚Äôm so depressed I can‚Äôt even get out of bed or leave my apartment. I‚Äôm struggling with everything, from feeding myself to showering to doing the basic things like paying bills that absolutely have to be done. I‚Äôve been out of work and fighting for unemployment for two months, eating rotted food from the food pantry because I don‚Äôt qualify for food stamps as you have to work at least 20 hours to qualify here. What do I do??? I admitted myself to the hospital a month ago and they released me early because I tested positive for COVID.

"Any recommendations on how I should approach this with my psychiatrist? My psychiatrist told me that she is basically running out of medication options for me to try.

"Newly diagnosed So I  M20 finally got my bipolar diagnosis. 

And I feel like it‚Äôs kind of hard now, I would say I am in a manic stage at the moment and I feel very confused now if I even have bipolar or if I just made myself believe it all?? Is this a normal thing does others also feel this sometimes üò≠üòÇ it keeps switching between being sure and unsure. Even though I finally got the diagnosis 

And I also am always confused in a sense where I‚Äôm getting so confused by stuff like doing something out of the ordinary or anything at all. Like do I actually want to do this or is it because I am manic, and will i get tired of it after a while. Or decisions or anything in that matter. I feel like it‚Äôs kind of hard to find out what is the disorder and whats not, if anyone got some advice for it I would love to hear it or just if you have felt the same way.

I feel like it‚Äôs kind of hard to also describe what it is as I‚Äôve just recently learned to actually put words into what I am feeling and still trying to improve with my therapist so feel free to ask questions if you want an explanation on some of it üòÖü•≤

I‚Äôve also never really known anyone with bipolar before so I am still learning about the disorder and still have a lot to learn. Mine is definitely focused on my depressive episodes lasting way longer and then manic with lots of impulses, and I dont know I kind of feel so lost üòÖ so even hearing you guys thought or advice or how it was to you when you got diagnoses would love to hear anything.",bipolar

"Step towards success!  Historically, my manic episodes have resulted in me spending a good chunk of my money on random projects that I'll never do, followed by depressive episodes so long that by the time I'm functioning again it's too late to return anything! This was fine when I had money at my disposal, but I don't have that anymore. 

My last manic episode resulted in me having almost no money in my account and I've been scraping by and needing my moms help since July. THANKFULLY! I was medicated then and haven't had another manic episode since then......

Until now. Good news: I have no money in my bank account so I can't sit in bed and spend money on online shopping and doordash.
Bad news: I have 300 dollars in cash from selling a camera on FB, and unlimited access to the stores near me and even further away with the bus. 

Solution: Put my money in my safe and give the keys to my mom until my episode is over. I feel like this is a really good step in the right direction for me because in the past I was convinced that I wasn't spending that much and it bit me in the butt. 

I'm happy that I'm well enough to make this decision at the beginning of my episode, and that I have someone I trust to hold onto my money for me. Just wanted to celebrate a bit :D ",bipolar

"Blaming bipolar disorder I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder 7 months ago after a mania/psychosis episode. After my diagnosis, I blame all my behavior on being  bipolar. I know others in this group have probably experienced doing the same thing. If you have overcome it‚Ä¶ how did you decipher actions you could control vs actions that were caused by your disorder?

"Is it smart to live closer to my dad for college? I'm bipolar type II and I am still passively (?) suicidal (much better than I was a couple months ago!). I have two options for schools: one is a bigger, better university with more scholarships and one is a smaller university, but is less expensive (as a baseline) and is closer to my dad, who would only be 45 minutes away and is my main support for my bipolar disorder.

He says in case anything bad happens to me he'd like to be close by, and in case I need anything he'd be right there. Mostly for things like in case I need medication, if I need rides to a therapist, etc., but with the bigger university I'd have the access to these on-campus and with a shuttle, anyways.


But I'm a little scared of myself I guess. I think I'll be okay and I know I'm supposed to be independent but is it different if you're bipolar? Can I ever be independent while bipolar? I don't know what to do. I want to go to the bigger university but I don't want to die in a depressive episode.

"How I went viral during an episode  2 years ago at the height of the pandemic, in a manic episode that lasted 3 days, I created a fan page dedicated to Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Canadian Conservatives. I posted so many political memes non-stop that I garnered over 2.5k followers on Facebook in 2 days.

I was making fun of Trudeau and used a lot of catchy yet accusatory language because in my manic state I thought it was well-deserved and justified. I don't think like that anymore and no longer post on my page because I'm still embarrassed.

Unfortunately it seems the Conservatives beg to differ because a few months after I created that page where I dissed on Trudeau with every creative style conceivable to a bipolar person, the Conservatives started using a similar catchy yet anti-liberal accusatory style of communication in their social media posts and interactions. It's now gotten so bad, that people in parliament can barely keep a rational conversation as soon as the Conservatives start talking. It's also pretty bad that a lot of Pierre Poilievre's posts now resemble more of an Avenger's trailer than respectable content I can put confidence in.

So I guess if you're wondering why the Canadian Conservatives act and post so cringe, now you know. Their role model was a person undergoing a manic episode who happened to garner +2500 followers in 2 days.",bipolar
"It's getting dark again.... So it's been seven months since my last round of medication
 (not on purpose I've just got life issues like lack of money, drive, and support system to get back on them) 
I've gone into maina 4 or 5 times since this but it's mostly been depressive. I am currently trying to get on meds however the doctor I'm trying to see Is taking their sweet time with everything. I'm angry, I'm angry all the time. I do grounding technics, I take a few mins and go to the garage (it's closed and sound proof) to scream or just get all my emotions out so I can go back to being depressed. I want to hurt things, I want to hurt people. I just can't tho. I was forced to grow up fast in a toxic house hold and this has made me a submissive person to the point that if it weren't for the angry out spurts they would walk all over me and my kindness. 
Lately It's been getting dark I'm seeing things 
That arnt there and hearing things louder than my own thoughts that arnt there. I'm scared. I know at this point I'm self aware enough that I need meds but can't put the engery into getting on them and staying on them. My support system is small but strong. (Litterly my husband and my 2 best friends) but that's it. When I have outbursts I get yelled at from everyone else that IM MAKING THEM UPSET and I shouldn't have outburst or be angry that i just need to keep my nose to the ground and just work and keep everything as normal as can be. I cant keep a job for the life of me. The longest job i had was a shit show and they worked me 7 days a week on busy months. Soo you know...toxic i finnally left that one and have another one lined up in novemeber. On the inside I'm dieing. I hate myself I hate it here. I hate the fact that I can't even regulate my own emotions enough sometimes that I can't even form sentences or talk to people. 
I am 2 seconds from ending a 20 year friendship with one of my friends because she said I don't reach out to her as often as I should. I've messaged this person for weeks on end after the last conversation about my isolation. I can't fucking do it all yet people make me responsible for it all. I'm tired. If it weren't for my husband I wouldn't have been here a year ago. I don't know what I can do untill I get on meds. I don't know what I should do. How I should act. It's all a fucking show at this point and I'm tired of being on stage. They won't let me relax i can't even lay in bed without someone crying about how the dishes arnt done or how dinner isnt cooks or how the house is a mess (grandparents are semi horders) somehow its all my fault.

"Struggling after trauma Long story short, I was date rape drugged a couple of nights ago in a bar by a man. The experience itself was horrific, the aftermath was horrific, the treatment I received in hospital was horrific and now I am struggling badly. I feel like it's triggered a depressive episode as well as a bit of ptsd, as I have been having severe issues with my sleep, very vivid nightmares and waking up forgetting where I am at night (common symptoms I get before a manic episode). 

I have also been crying all the time, suffering from feelings of loneliness and severe paranoia and I just don't know what to do. I am about 2 months into starting treatment on lamictal and I just feel so heartbroken that this has happened because I was on such a good track. 

I also feel like I potentially ruined what could have been the start of a really good relationship with a really cool person because of this event, unfortunately they had to see me in this state and I was so out of my mind that I confessed about having bipolar and since then things have gone really quiet and I am just so embarrassed. 

There is so much in my head, I keep thinking how if something worse had happened to me and I hadn't escaped from this person, everyone would have just assumed I had done it intentionally due to my bipolar or looked at my past and blamed me.

I don't know why i am posting all of this and i am sorry, I just need support and some kind words I think, I am not sure what I need.",bipolar
"How do y‚Äôall deal with the emotional extremes?  I‚Äôm now nearing the end of my intense manic episode and something I‚Äôve noticed for myself is how in situations with other people, it can take a lot of stimulus to generate a emotional response, or very little. There‚Äôs seemingly no middle ground between the two. 

Recently I had a short interaction with a woman that challenged my ego in a very small way and it has led to days of self reflection. And on the other hand many situations people tell me about or ask my opinion on elicit no emotional response. For example, a friend venting to me about his relationship and I cannot empathize or understand anything he‚Äôs saying. I can‚Äôt even logic my way through it. I fear that when my time comes for such situations I‚Äôll be left unprepared and it‚Äôll throw off my stability. I don‚Äôt think I could prepare myself beforehand for such events as I am not sure how I will respond. ",bipolar
"Fresh Start A year ago I was on the ass end of the worst manic episode I've ever experienced whilst in early recovery from drugs and alcohol in crippling debt with little hope for the future stuck in a job I hated earning next to nothing getting no where and had to move back to my parents place with basically nothing to my name. 

It's been a journey since then. Meds, therapy, meetings, making amends and trying to figure out what the hell I'm going to do with the next half of my life.

Good things can happen.  

In a matter of weeks I'll be moving to an outback country town to work in a gold mine driving big ass trucks 1km underground for 110k a year working seven days on seven days off. In a few years I'll be debt free with money in the bank.

"What helps you move? I'm BP2 and I have little energy even in remission (like, enough to work full-time if I delegate childcare and household chores and don't socialize; or do chores, help my son with homework and socialize if I stay at home). I have this dream of being more active and healthier but I never get to it, or if I start, I stop in a month or two. Physical activity just slips away when my energy levels go down. 

If you are in the same situation as me, what helps you restart moving more or stay on track longer? For me, having someone to have a conversation with while walking is a big motivator, I just stop noticing how low-level tired I am. I thought that having individual sessions with a coach might help, but I don't know what kind of specialists help in cases like mine. The only coaches I see are young and extremely fit ones at the gym and swimming pool who also work with fit people.",bipolar

I got individual therapy, group therapy, med management, AA, and made friends.

Now we text almost everyday. I‚Äôve recently started experiencing hallucinations which he has been helping me navigate. Obviously I have a therapist and psychiatrist and meds, but relating to someone is a totally different type of comfort.

I was stable for over a year, my meds felt like they were starting to not work anymore, insurance changed, needed a new Dr.(too much responsibility/effort), so I just quit taking them.

I'm now on the tail end of a hypomanic episode after I finished a depressive episode, didn't sleep for days, cleaned my entrie house and same day had a panic attack at a local concert and had to be taken to the hospital because I couldn't calm down.

How do you tell someone about your bipolar? So I have this friend/mentor/relative that I really admire and look up to who have always checked on me and supported me. Infact he's the one who referred me to the current workplace where he's in senior management.

"if i forgot i was mentally ill i wouldn‚Äôt know who i am this feels so out of pocket to say, but if i forgot i was mentally ill i wouldn‚Äôt know who i am. bipolar doesn‚Äôt fully define me but it has a great deal to do with who i‚Äôve been this far for 22 years. i was diagnosed when i was 20 and ever since that day shit just made sense. the impulsivity, the randomness of the things i do, the heightened emotions. i‚Äôm also an artist and i know that many great artists have it. in no way am i comparing myself to them, though i will say we do have the capacity to be more. not only more, but are very often a lot as we are. and not in a negative sense, but in the sense that we are very strong people, creative people. to live a day within a brain like ours would be hard for a neurotypical person so give yourself a break. and to create with a brain like ours is powerful. 

if you are not a creator i am quiet certain you‚Äôre damn good at what you do. 

all that is to say that those of us who are bipolar, were very strong people. in many ways. we‚Äôre also special. incredibly intelligent. we think outside of the box, we are weird and that is beautiful. we think fast. we think on a vast spectrum. we do things that are out of the blue. 

i know that some of the decisions we make don‚Äôt always impact our lives positively, but they create a story. and i‚Äôve always felt that i am but a character in a novel, with that mindset we can get ahold of the power that lets us recreate our mistakes into a beautiful story. it doesn‚Äôt end where your manic episode led you to. it ends where you end it. you have the power to separate yourself from this disease.

"Itching Under the Psych-Skin - I need to consult with you First time using Reddit so be gentle on me... also, sorry for the long post.

Short introduction - I am 23 years old, diagnosed with Bipolar for about 5 years now. Have had my depression, mixed episodes and hypomania. The last major episode was quite long ago, in the summer of 2021, and since then I have dealt with anxiety, the kind I usually get in a mixed episode, but something more ""subtle"" since I was already medicated. I am currently well medicated and have been balanced for the past few years.

But - in the past month I have had some changes in my life. My country is at war, I came back from abroad after two months, I finished my degree and I am hoping for a scholarship and then to start my M.A., so things are not  really stable.

On top of it - I have been feeling quite strange the past two weeks. The first description that popped into my mind was ""itching under the psych-skin."" You know the feeling, when it's itching under your skin? like, you feel this uneasy feeling, but it's not on the surface and you can't put your finger on it. So, it's something like that. I feel like I have grey feelings. I am not sad or depressed, but  I do find myself having a small void in my heart, like emptiness. Again, it's nothing dramatic, but it is strange.

In addition, I am moved really easily. One example would be me crying on the bus listening to a song I had already listened to a hundred times. Another example would be me feeling shattered after watching a TV show.

Another quite disturbing thing is me having anxiety one day. I was at my friend's house with my friends and got this major tummy ache. At first, I just winged it off with a tranquilliser, but the day afterwards I couldn't get up of the couch because of the ache until I finally puked and then took tranquilliser. Note - I know that this was anxiety and not some kind of a virus. I know myself well enough to differentiate between the two aches.

The last point is that my friend told me the other day that I was very loud and spoke fast. She has never seen me in mania/hypomania so for her to notice it without having any idea of what I look like in those scenarios is also disturbing me.

To sum up - these four points worry me and are not anything I really had before. I feel like these are signs that I am supposed to be in some kind of an episode - be it depression, hypomania or a mixed one, and that the fact that I am medicated prevents its full awakening. I will of course consult with my psychiatrist, but I am also writing here because I want to hear some of your experiences and thoughts. I have never really had a conversation with another bipolar person, so I wanna know - have you also had something alike? A glimpse of an episode nonetheless being medicated? Do you know this ""itching under the skin"" feeling as well? If you have and do, how was it solved? Did you change something in your meds, or did you just leave these glimpses alone and they passed away by themselves? I will say that I am happy with my current med situation. My meds have been stabilizing me for years, I sleep well at night and I'm functioning in my daily life. I am not sure if I really wanna change something, so if you can assure/disapprove my intuition of staying steady it'd be great.

Sorry again for the long post, and thank you in advance for your thoughts. <3",bipolar

"Starting to Dwell on the past Again Before I started meds I used to dwell on the past so much and I used to dwell specifically on the negative aspects of the past and only bring up those aspects to my ex. Since being on meds for over 2 weeks now, it helped so much with me not dwelling on situations, specifically negative situations. Recently, I noticed the negative thoughts have started flooding back from over a year ago and I got really upset about them yesterday and couldn't stop crying for the longest time. Last night, my ex and I were talking and I was talking about how I get lost at the park alone but I always find my way with GPS. She said I need to learn to do things on my own because I'm so codependent. I told her I don't know how she will handle stuff alone too. She said I was infantilizing her and I said that neither of us could make it on our own. She said I'll find another person to live off of. I was so broken and was considering going to a homeless shelter. I called my family and I just ended up wasting their time and they have their own problems to deal with. I shouldn't have even called them, because me and my ex made up and everything was fine. I think maybe I'm going through a depressive episode.

"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm able to love anyone now that I‚Äôm on the right meds In the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù era when I was super unstable, constantly having long, severe episode after long, severe episode, I used to get really intense crushes on people. It was an obsession for me to find all the clues that they loved me but just weren‚Äôt ready to ask me out. I reached a point where I couldn‚Äôt handle being rejected without hurting myself. At one point, a guy told me he loved me back but wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship right then‚Ä¶ and then went on to date someone else. I saw them together and decided to try and hang myself, breaking my neck, because I wanted his attention again. That‚Äôs probably the worst thing I‚Äôve ever done honestly. The subsequent psych stay led to me getting on effective meds though.

In the time since then, I‚Äôm relatively stable. I don‚Äôt have long, severe episodes anymore. I can cope with my feeling better. But I also struggle to feel anything sometimes.

I thought a guy I‚Äôm friends with was interested in me. Completely convinced he was going to ask me out. I straight up asked him where we at because I was confused by his mixed signals. He apologized for being flirty and leading me on, that he only sees me as a friend.

I don‚Äôt even know if I liked him or if I just wanted someone to like me. I got rejected and feel a dull numbness. I‚Äôm already afraid no one will ever love me or want to marry me.

I‚Äôm also seeing a psychiatrist registrar, psychiatrist consultant, social worker, doctor, and attending community appointments where I‚Äôll see more people. I was on an antipsychotic and then got taken off that because i didn‚Äôt feel good and was put on a mood stabilizer. Since I‚Äôve been on the mood stabilizer my moods have been great and I feel calm but I‚Äôve been having daily psychotic thoughts and lots of visual hallucinations that come and go. Could be schizoaffective? 

I should also mention I work full time in an emergency department and have felt psychotic at work once before but I now carry my leftover antipsychotics just in case. Seeing my psychiatrist registrar next week where I will hopefully get prescribed another antipsychotic but in all honesty I can‚Äôt really find it that serious. Like this all just feels normal to me.

Now I was live on him as much as possible. My husband and I are on lifeline but we agreed to start a new relationship from the very bottom so start anew.  We started sleeping in the same bed twice a week only when we can sleep together twice or three times. Last night sleeping with him was so fucking bizarre. He slept three hours but in between 11:41 pm and 2:45 he was kicking and moving around, he cried in his sleep and he was touching himself in his sleep it was so fucking bizarre and it was scary. Sometimes I asked him if you want to come to bed tonight and he would lie and say he is going to come in but he lies and lies down on the sofa. So I told him, I asked him what you are doing to me is torture, I told him please stop lying to me if you don‚Äôt want to come over just say so for that night and I would be ok.

"Hypo/mania symptoms? Last august I kind of went off the deep end. My fianc√© and I were partying for a week and one night after drinking until 3 in the morning we ended up having a threesome with a roommate. I managed to turn the threesome into a poly relationship, ending up in California by Christmas with my ‚Äúnew partner‚Äù. Looking back this was extremely out of character because ive been nearly obsessive jealous and insecure our entire 5 year relationship. My fianc√© (im so incredibly grateful for him) stuck through it with me, I went through an extreme mixed episode in Jan-March; broke up with both partners and moved back into my parents house two years after moving out. 

March to June/July I was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. July I start sleeping less again, august was my birthday. Weird shit started popping up for me, spiritual journeys, thinking people online were bots, seeing shadow people in the corner of my eye in a different part of the house. You can take a look at my post history to get a vibe of what I‚Äôm talking about. 

I complain about my brain never shutting up, I‚Äôve had ‚Äúconversations‚Äù with myself. Another voice that‚Äôs me, observing my actions and criticizing myself, a younger me that I‚Äôve talked with twice, usually though it just feels like several trains of consciousness running across each other at the same time. 

I had an extreme break from reality one night when I was 14/15 after an involuntary hospitalization and being pulled out of school. Convinced my family and friends were nurses and doctors and I didn‚Äôt actually get released but that I was hallucinating being at home. It only happened for a few hours that night and I dismissed it as extreme stress. 

I was on MDD treatment as a teenager with just SSRIs and held a job for two years + friends. I stopped taking my medicine and started smoking weed at 17 and moved out. I stopped counseling, I haven‚Äôt held a job for longer than eight weeks since then. 

My PCP said the episode from the year before and extreme depression sounded like BD and gave me medicine to start weaning myself onto slowly. I have a counseling appointment next month.

Like if I just mention that I had a end it all thought with an impulsive plan but didn‚Äôt follow through and called 988 last week and over the weekend would that be alarming enough for them to hospitalize me or is the fact I‚Äôm still here and didn‚Äôt go to the ER enough?

"Religion and Bipolar Hey, I‚Äôd love to hear people‚Äôs experiences on this topic, if any of you have any. 

In some of my worst hypomanic/ manic (doctor is unsure whether type 1 or 2 yet) episodes, they would always revolve around god, the devil, demons,  the paranormal and spirituality. It‚Äôs interesting because ever since a child I always loved watching ghost hunting programmes and have always had an interest in that type of stuff, but it‚Äôs died off a little as I‚Äôve gotten older. 
Anyway, does anyone have any theories on way mania often includes things like religion? I haven‚Äôt been to church, and had no ties to Christianity, but the manic episodes that were scariest for me were the ones were I felt like for and the devil were talking to me. I was so scared that it would keep me up at night in genuine fear, I even stuck a picture of Jesus on my wall at one point. 
For the past few years I‚Äôve always known that researching to much into religion / spirituality is a downward slope for me, so I tend not to do it. As I‚Äôm getting older, I feel like it would be nice to have faith in something but also know the impact that it could have on my mental health if I research too much. 
I am medicated now so I have been researching but feel like I‚Äôm paranoid that this could just be a temporary thing.  
Do any of you have any similar experiences? I‚Äôd love to hear if you have as it can feel lonely!",bipolar

"I switched antidepressants and I became more depressed during the past few days It started over the weekend, on Friday actually.

I think it's because my new med hasn't kicked in yet. I started it almost two weeks.

With depression it mostly manifested as anhedonia and extreme boredom.

I remember being super bored (not being busy over the weekend added to it since I'm a part-time student that isn't working)

I remember I was craving stimulation.

Nothing really made me happy.

I haven't been this like in a while.

Since school week started I'm doing a bit better since I'm more busy with my online class but for most of the day I'm just super bored as try to stimulate myself using my laptop or phone but it isn't enough.

With depression I still lost interest in most of hobbies. I still find it hard to focus and enjoy things like TV, movies, and video games. Things that used to be major time killers for me.

I wish there was something I can do to feel better. Maybe my med will kick next week or two?

"How common is it for bipolar to go into remission? I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 last year after a hypomanic episode, since starting my medication I haven't experienced any new episodes. I recently got a new psychiatrist and he said it is too early to tell if I'm truly bipolar and that only time can tell. He also said that the goal is for me to stop taking my medication when I'm ""well"" again. He also diagnosed me with BPD, but didn't really want to explain why.

"Experience with workplace accommodations Posted about this is r/askHR but I also want to hear from people who can actually relate. 

I've been having a really hard year and my mood has not been stable for several months. And yes I've talked to my provider about it, I've also had a lot of personal stuff going on. I got written up and put on a corrective action plan over the summer. At the time, I wasn't allowing myself to recognize or admit just how bad I was struggling and ask for help. I got it together and did everything they asked. I also then asked for accommodations. I turned everything in to HR and had a conversation with my supervisor about what that could look like with my job. This was really hard for me because I never want to use this disorder as an excuse.

At the beginning of the year I took on some extra PRN work through my agency. Because of everything else I've had going on I got really behind on those assignments. I was so anxious about being behind that I became pretty avoidant when it came to any communication about them and took a long time to respond if I did. I did talk to my supervisor about it somewhat but didn't go into any details about the personal stuff I had/have going on. It's gotten to the point where my (lack of) performance is hurting my agency's position with the agency that contracts us for this work. 

I can accept that I messed up and I had already told them that I no longer wanted these extra assignments after I finished what I had. Today, I was put on a corrective action plan again. And threatened with potential termination. This CAP is pretty strict and it's tasks are primarily for my actual job, which I don't feel like I'm that behind on. The PRN work was a separate position with a separate contract. Mentally, I don't think I can keep up with this right. I'm already stressed about the added tasks each day. Finding another job isn't really an option.

"Low frustration threshold Recently, my frustration threshold has been on the floor. 

I started a new job recently, and all the noises that come with being in a shared office have me *stressed.*

And my brother is getting more annoying by day. ""Hi, sister,"" every time he spots me. Then, he repeats himself louder if I don't respond and just try ignoring him. Just today, he was throwing coins at me from across the living room, just trying to get on my nerves. And then he says ""look at this"" at something racist on his phone, so I ignore it, and he PUTS HIS PHONE ON MY FACE, so, naturally, I grabbed his phone and threw it across the floor. 

I'm going to start isolating in my room to avoid everything, just go to work and then go to my room and that's it, but that's not healthy either, and is probably going to lead to a depressive episode.

I might be trending hypomanic right now with the frustration and I keep buying things when I should be watching my spending during this time of transitioning between jobs. Idk, though. My sleep is still fine, so far. Maybe some PTSD symptoms are overlapping? I've felt hypervigilant and jumpy recently, but also kind of spaced out at the same time. 

I'm medication compliant and I have a psychiatry appointment on the 4th. I need to see about restarting therapy once I get my new insurance cards in. Until then, I probably should try out some relaxation methods in the meantime. I'm about to go do some deep breathing and maybe listen to a YouTube video to guide me through manually relaxing my body. Maybe I'll make tea if my brother goes to bed before I fall asleep.

I click way too many photos of myself and find myself not being present in the moment because of this.

For the last two weeks I have been conducting an experiment to determine a dataset from which I can calculate mood shifts based on external variables. It‚Äôs a simple summation formula with weights that results in a mood state score. You plug in your variables such as sleep, stimuli, stress, pharma, etc. So in order to calculate these weights, I have been using myself as the test subject and systematically running each variable from one extreme to the other. 

As expected, the results have caused some fluctuations in my mood and current state of mind, but I have to complete this mission.

"Do you have dreams? TL;DR: Do you usually have/remember your dreams down to small details? Are they mostly negative, positive or it's mixed? Also, do you have trouble getting to sleep or maintaining it?  

Contextualized question:  

As far as my memory can go I remember how I always had trouble sleeping. My mother says since I was a very young child I suffer with insomnia. I have both trouble with getting to sleep and then after I finally sleep it doesn't last more than a few hours. When I'm in hypomania I don't sleep at all for up to 3 days in a row without medication.       

About the dreams itself, I was always confused with people talking about them, basically because either I don't dream or don't remember them after I wake up in about 90% of the days.  

It's not that I don't dream ever, it's just that it is so unusual that when it happens I could count in the fingers of one hand in the span of an entire month. The ones I remember are usually very negative/sad involving my fears or full blown senseless nightmares.  

After my diagnosis and medications adjustment I'm prescribed 2 medications to help me sleep, one to induce the sleep but doesn't last long and another one that is weaker and doesn't help me to get to sleep but makes it last a little longer.    

I'm on a stable medication course now with no need for changes in over a year, and suddenly on the last couple months I've been having a lot of memorable dreams and they're not that negative anymore, some are even good ones (although some of those make me sad when I wake up because they're too good).",bipolar
"Just got benzos again‚Ä¶ Tw - selfe harm

So I‚Äôve been diagnosed for around 4 years now‚Ä¶ been doing okish‚Ä¶ mostly on the depressed side but not so bad that I can‚Äôt live properly‚Ä¶ was hospitalized 2 years ago because of a rough depression and suicidal thoughts‚Ä¶

When I was in the hospital they gave me benzos to relax and I mean they worked great but I hated the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù I just didn‚Äôt feel like myself anymore, but at least I didn‚Äôt feel suicidal‚Ä¶ even after just 2 weeks the withdrawal was hard‚Ä¶

Fast forward - last week I hit rock bottom‚Ä¶ never been so depressed in my life with constant thoughts of harming myself and suizidal thoughts‚Ä¶ been to the doc today, she gave me stronger antidepressants but said they can take up to one month to work properly and prescribed me benzos to deal with the bad thoughts for now‚Ä¶

I took the first one like an hour ago and I mean I do feel better, but the high I really don‚Äôt like‚Ä¶ I mean I don‚Äôt get it I used to get high on illegal stuff all the time and when it is actually legal I don‚Äôt like it‚Ä¶

I begged her to not put me on sick leave cause I actually love my job and my boss knows about my depression and is fine with me doing the bare minimum.

"my partner is debating leaving me i‚Äôm so heartbroken at the moment. yesterday me and my partner had a long conversation about how he has been feeling. He ultimately told me that he feels unprepared and not equipped to deal with my mental health. That my depressive episode has impacted him too much and he just doesn‚Äôt think he can go on much longer. 


I‚Äôm heartbroken, I‚Äôve been in a depressive episode for over a month now because I started a sexual assault survivor group therapy. It‚Äôs been hard on me- I‚Äôve made some ugly realizations during this group. I‚Äôve had a breakdown at least 4 times this week. My breakdowns just include me crying for an hour and then going to bed and sleeping most of my day away. 


My partner said it has broken his heart to see me this way and not be able to help me. He says it breaks his heart because he knows I‚Äôm doing everything I possibly can to get better but that it‚Äôs hard on him to see that sometimes my efforts don‚Äôt result in anything. 


I don‚Äôt blame him. I‚Äôm heartbroken too. I‚Äôm hurt too that sometimes my efforts come to no avail.  I don‚Äôt know what to say or do. 


I explained to him that my bipolar is not something he can fix, and it‚Äôs not his fault. That I will never EVER give up on trying to get better. But that I can ultimately understand if he wants to leave. Because, I know better than anyone else on this earth that this disorder is tiring. He says he‚Äôs willing to give us a try. 


But I thought about it all of today and realized that maybe I should just let him go. Maybe it‚Äôs not worth the attempt. I‚Äôm heartbroken. This was the first relationship I have been genuinely happy in, I have had so much love for him. I‚Äôm heartbroken that it seems it‚Äôs coming to an end very soon. 


I‚Äôm so tired. It feels like this illness rips more from me everyday. I don‚Äôt know what to do, or where to turn. I feel like I just lost the love of my life and I‚Äôm holding on to scraps. 


I know this moment will pass. I know it will get better. But I feel so broken right now. I swear I‚Äôm doing everything to get better, I take my medications every day, I exercise 3 times a week, I eat a healthy amount, I go outside, I‚Äôm in therapy two hours a week, I hangout with friends, I complete my work‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm doing everything right but my brain just won‚Äôt cooperate with me.

"I ruined my marriage I have hated myself for as long as I can remember. I am a middle aged man now, married to a wonderful woman for almost 20 years, with 2 beautiful teenagers.

I was on Celexa for years, but in the last few months I was diagnosed as bipolar and put on more appropriate medication. I feel much calmer now but too little too late. 

I really believe my self loathing caused me to project all of my self hate towards my family, and the bipolar just made it worse.

If something happened yesterday, it could feel like it was months ago. If I don‚Äôt write something down, it‚Äôs lost almost immediately. Like for example, I had to attend a meeting without my business partner and she asked me what she missed (pretty much immediately after the meeting) and I couldn‚Äôt remember majority of what had been discussed. Even if I write something down, I forget I wrote it down. I have reminders in my phone to take my meds, but if I don‚Äôt take it immediately, I‚Äôll forget to take it because it‚Äôs like I read the reminder and it goes straight out my brain when I look away. I can go days without showering or making a proper meal because in my head I must have just done it. Food goes bad all the time because to me I just opened it but weeks will go by. 

I think I might be stuck in a weird dissociative state. Like I‚Äôm not present enough in life to retain what is happening. I wasn‚Äôt always like this.. I don‚Äôt know when it got so bad. It‚Äôs hard to maintain relationships with people because I just don‚Äôt think about reaching out, cause again, in my head I just talked to them.

"You Guys Live Like This?! (I actually need support) I believe I have just had my first full on manic episode, with some complimentary psychosis on the side. I'm still in the throes of it but at least now I'm aware. 

I have to say I have experienced some baaaad stuff in my life, and this has to be the worst of them all. 

Hell, I wasn't even that happy during my manic episode, I just had hope, like, a lot of hope. All lot of things I thought were true about life, started seeming untrue, in good a way! 

I realized I was attractive when I hadn't felt that way in years. I thought romantic love was possible for me. I thought God was on my side, because I followed Him. Thought I could turn it all around, all of it, all 32 years of undiagnosed passive suicidality. I thought I could be a beacon of good, and be a leader, and a standard bearer in this dark time. And then I thought I was the next Jesus Christ.

Yeah.

I think part of it was at the very lest compensatory. I lost several support systems within the span of a year. My therapy group, my dog, my therapist. So many good things in my life just vanished in little to no time at all. No one has the time to hear me speak about all of it right now, but I wish I could say, that that was the worst of it, but no, the worst of it it is this come down. I want to die. I want to kill myself, but I can't and I won't. I even had a near death experience during the midst of all this, so I realized, ultimately, I don't want to be dead, but I'm just having a really hard time living. All my worst fears feel like they're coming true. I've been hospitalized before, but this is worse, I think, because this time, I actually had hopes for myself and now they're being tried by fire. I truly don't know how I'm going to survive this but I am trying. It's all I have left.

I wouldn't say I'm ecstatic, but I'm doing pretty good. I haven't really cried or gotten nearly as upset as I have in the past over small things. I've started looking into spiritual things with myself. I've sat myself down and started a journal.

I've started hearing more people out on why they think the things they do rather than act on pure emotion. 

I've lost 10 pounds in a month, my A1C is down (wonderful, jouyus.)

"Extreme Agitation Hello,


For the last 1.5-2 weeks I‚Äôve been extremely irritable. I‚Äôve also had a few short and random bouts of severe depression that resolve with a day or so. Anyway, my therapist hypothesized that my aggression was due to tapering off an SSRI and a mood stabilizer too quickly. I guess I agree. 

It seems like every noise, every word spoken, or any action that someone else does irritates to me to the extreme. And I do mean extreme. Just moments ago a family member kept talking to me and I started screaming. Everything irritates me to the point of showing severe aggression to people for seemingly small things. I‚Äôm at a total loss.


I‚Äôve tried all the coping skills I‚Äôve learned of and nothing helps at all. I see my therapist tomorrow and my psychiatrist soon too. I will of course be telling them. I just need help finding ways to cope or calm down in the interim.

"Young and learning  I was diagnosed with bipolar December 2023. My life was in shambles, I had experienced my first manic episode this time last year.

 I have recently fucked up and two of my best friends cannot trust me anymore.

I know I fucked up and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll never gain their trust or friendship back; but I also have been not doing great this semester and acting out and testing relationships more than usual.

"Being Bipolar affects every relationship I've ever had cuz I can't be loyal  My bf took my cell phone and saw sexting with other people. (He wasnt snooping, he brought me my phone cuz someone called me and then he saw a notification).
 Now he doesn't know if he can trust me and forgive me. And sincerely, neither do I. I feel terrible, a bad person, a scumbag. While i was texting, i didn't feel anything and neither thought about consequences. 
I told him that he didn't mean anything, it was an outbreak in mania, and that it was just like a ""hobby"" (like i did cuz i was bored and there were always people bugging me in my dms so i just I just went with the flow. I barely remembered the messages and really didn't want to do anything. I just wanted to ""have"" myself passing messages like that but never had any feelings. 
I now I know I really messed things up. 
We had plans to get married and a beatiful future together and I destroyed it all. 
My head is a million, I can't say anything to him other than just crying and apologizing. 
My mind is pure blank. Im shocked with what I did and barely remembered. Also really really ashamed. So bad, i tried to k!ll myself but luckily a neighboor helped me just in time and now im recovering. 
But we want to talk and try to solve it. We still love each other very much. But i understand that trust issues is a real thing now. 
What can I say and do? I simply dont know how to act, im suffering. :( 
Now im with a broken heart and a broken body. Which makes it all worse but i dont wanna try to k!ll myself again... i just want this pain and crying stops... 
 (Until now, i didnt take any medicine or mood stabilizers cuz i thought i was fine and didnt wanted to relay on pills forever, but because of the attempt, I was referred to a psychiatrist and I am very open to starting treatment and therapy because I can't stand making so many partners suffer anymore because of my lack of emotional responsibility)

"Psychotic/Manic vent art from 2020-2022 I started showing serious psychotic/manic bipolar symptoms around 2020 and, well, the timing couldn't be more perfect - what with the lockdown and all - for me to brew in my downward spiral of insanity in solitary confinement, looking outside to empty streets, looking online to crazy riots, political brainrot and conspiracy theories about vaccines. I was in a few wards and made plenty of traditional art there I may post later depending on things.

Most of these were made when I was running on 0 hours of sleep for 3+ days of endless mania, or suddenly hatched an idea in the middle of trying to sleep and got up to do it. Creative compulsions, yknow.

Anyone have any handy phrases or questions that seem to work well?

Backstory details: I was parentified, so asking people for help or support is my biggest fear. I also withdrew from friends for years because of how severe my condition was.

Current details: Because of my backstory I have only managed to stay in distant contact with 2 friends via text. I have only kind of recently this year started to share about my diagnosis. I started out just reconnecting with both of them, apologizing profusely, and only asking details about them and their lives. After a couple months, I shared my condition. Both of these friends reacted in fear initially, supporting my delusions of ""I'm unlovable, I'm worthless, everyone literally hates me..."" blah blah I'm sure y'all know üòÖ

I want to remain in contact with these friends because I LOVE them, but I'm also recognizing that I need support in a depressive episode.

Any handy phrases or conversation starters or to help communicate that I need support? When in depression I find it hard to articulate what I need.

"Identity crisis with late diagnosis  I'm a female in her early 30s and I was just diagnosed bipolar type II a year ago. I've been in the mental health system since I was 15, so more than 15 years in treatment, and got so many diagnosis, but specially depression and borderline personality disorder which apparently is a pretty common misdiagnosis in women. Even tho it kinda made sense it never completely clicked for me but now everything makes sense.

The thing is that at the beggining it was a relief to get the right diagnosis and the right medication! BUT after a while a lot of questions about my identity are popping in my head. Since I'm on medication I'm a super easy chill person, sometimes too flat. And I'm just wondering, is this the real me or is it the manic/depressed person the real one?

Because my behaviour sometimes is similar to my grandmas (not in any sort of abuse, she can just recognize patterns of mania then depression etc), she doesn't help me, or want to be around me. She refuses to take me to doctors to get the treatment I need (medication or hospitalization when things get really bad) because she says ""I don't need it"", but its very clear I do, and I can't seek it myself as I'm a minor. She herself has never saught out help for her BPD or OCD despite it being offered constantly to her because she ""manages"" well enough, even though everyone knows she doesn't.

I was manic for a few weeks, and pretty self destructive. She didn't care, didn't check in on me, and even just made things worse for me. She'd purposefully push me to do worse things or put me in situations that were bad for me just to see what I would do/so she could get mad at me.
Now that I'm coming down from it she's doing the same. I can't leave my bed. I can't shower, or get changed, or brush my teeth, or eat. And she just won't leave me alone. She picks little things to scream at me over and makes small jabs every time I see her about my state right now.

"Recent Bipolar (Pre)Diagnosis Hello all, 

For some time now I have been suspecting I have bipolar disorder (mainly because of manic, or hypo manic episodes). This week, I opened up to my University‚Äôs therapist and she said my symptoms are indeed of Bipolar Disorder. However, she can‚Äôt officially diagnose me (hence I said pre-diagnosis), only my University‚Äôs psychiatrist department can, which is a long process and I‚Äôd only be able to be seen in December. But she said it‚Äôs pretty certain that I have it. 

Anyways, I guess I‚Äôm coming on here for some guidance. And because I feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with me, mostly because I feel like when people are diagnosed with bipolar, they are pretty sad about it, but I can‚Äôt help thinking to myself ‚Äúobviously I would have bipolar, nearly all great people in history had it, of course I would as well.‚Äù Almost like this god-like, narcissist thinking. But then I also keep thinking that I am gaslighting myself, and my therapist, into thinking that I have bipolar when I don‚Äôt.

Also, how long does it take you to go from a depressive episode to a manic? Because I‚Äôd say that Monday/Tuesday I was at rock bottom, like truly rock bottom. I hated my life, wanted to die, wanted to withdraw from this semester, etc. But then, after like 4 days I can already feel getting the god-complex energy that is associated with manic/hypo manic episodes? Like I can feel deep in my body getting more confident and more energetic. But I also feel like 4 days is such a short amount of time to transition from rock bottom depression to a hypo manic episode? Or is this normal in Bipolar Disorder? But then also, I keep thinking it‚Äôs all in my head? And that I am consciously making myself feel this way?

"Is it normal to feel like everyday is a battle? Got diagnosed and started taking medication in August. It has improved my quality of life vastly and, in a lot of ways, I feel like I got my life back. But damn, everyday feels like a battle to me. I don't know what I'm gonna get every time I wake up. Is it gonna be a good day, or is it gonna be one of those days where I'm a little bit sad or even irritable? Then sometimes things can change in the middle of the day. I start off happy and calm, then I get sad and think about all of the things I could be accomplishing or doing if I didn't have this disorder. I'm also constantly reminded of the fact that I have bipolar, and I carry the weight of that diagnosis everyday. I also think about all of the things I regret doing when I was hypomanic, and those thoughts bring with them a wave of sadness, guilt, and embarrassment.

I haven't ridden a bicycle since mid May, I should be a lot more tired than I am. Especially since I was only riding 5 miles max a day before my bike was stolen. 
 There are other signs I am presenting that Im not going to talk about. So it's not just a fluke. It just happened overnight. Got the bike Thursday evening. Went to sleep around midnight, woke up at 2AM Friday morning. Same thing last night.  
 The thing that I'm torn about at the moment is that I have my monthly check in with my Dr. on Tuesday. I don't fully trust her yet(HUGE Trust issues with LEO's & Medical personnel)We have only been working together for 2 months. I'm worried what she will do if I tell her the truth. Last time I was manic was back in January. Followed by 3 months of being stableish. Then depression until yesterday. I went off my meds in mid May. Just started meds again 2 months ago.

"people who grew up with bipolar disorder, how have things changed? (trigger aler for me, i notice that it has worsened in terms of intensity, especially the mania. i have always leaned more towards the depressive spectrum, with an unhealthy attachment to benzodiazepines and marijuana; it was like that for nine years. but i have noticed that in the last 5 years, the depressions have been shorter and not as intense, almost apathetic, with reduced substance use during the depressive period. and mania, wow, i am manic right now. it is much easier for me to become hypomanic and manic. i get out of them, and within a maximum of 6 months they come back, even stronger, more self-destructive, and at the same time more focused and directed. i have also been using cocaine lately; it has been a few times (6 times in 6 months, each time i used it for 2 days and very little), but still, i find it extremely strange because it was something that never appealed to me. and now i like it.  
but despite all of this, despite sleeping little (every 3 days), doing impulsive things, talking for 6 hours straight, using drugs that i used once in my life and hated when i was 20.. despite everything seeming like a huge mess destined for a giant fall, there‚Äôs one thing that i didn‚Äôt have when i didn‚Äôt have so much experience, understanding, and acceptance of the illness: awareness.  
there‚Äôs a voice in my head that knows it will go wrong, that this will have a price, that it‚Äôs not sustainable, and that it simply isn‚Äôt worth compromising my sanity and stability. that awareness that we‚Äôve gained over time, which knows that we are getting close to the limit, so it‚Äôs good to take small measures, no matter how small, before it becomes unbearable.

"Bipolar mild episodes coming through meds but I have no idea until it's over The thing is, I emotionally feel about the same all the time. Neutral or slightly negative/pessimistic. Probably anxious.

I've caught myself many times writing pages on pages of ideas and thoughts and analysis of those thoughts, cleaning the whole house and doing all the laundry and dishes after midnight. I'll make progress on projects and studying.

Then when I make it back to baseline I realize it was strange that I was doing those things - I felt totally normal emotionally and somatically.

Then I'll have a few weeks with bad dreams, sleeping much longer than usual, not getting much done, playing a lot of video games on the couch, not wanting to see friends, hating my job. But I don't feel *sad* or depressed inside.

These episodes are very mild compared to the utter destruction that was my unmedicated bipolar. But I think it's fascinating that symptoms are still happening behaviorally even though my inner world feels about the same.

"So scared to start new job it's making me sick I have been unemployed for two years after I left a very toxic workplace (retail).

"I was Ghosted by my therapist About two years ago I was ghosted by my therapist. I had been seeing her since 2017 and I thought we had had a good relationship. I thought we were close. I guess not. 
She was always a little flaky if I‚Äôm being honest but I attributed it to the fact that she had ADHD. I also have ADHD as well as the bipolar  disorder. 
When the pandemic started we had to switch to calls instead of seeing each other in person. After we switched she would constantly cancel appointments and reschedule them. I was annoyed by it but didn‚Äôt say anything. I‚Äôm way too much of a people pleaser. I should have said something but I didn‚Äôt. Oh well. 
Anyway, during the summer of 2022 she was cancelling appointments a lot more and always apologizing. I let it go because she had a lot going on in her life, but it did make me feel bad. One day, she texted that she had to cancel our appointment again and that she was so sorry. I replied with my usual message of no worries, it happens. She replied back that I must think she‚Äôs awful. I said I didn‚Äôt and that was the last I ever heard from her. She never texted back or anything. 
One thing I should mention about having ADHD is that you have problems with rejection. They hit REALLY hard and it feels devastating. So you can imagine how I felt after I didn‚Äôt hear back from her. As the days passed the feeling of rejection got worse and worse. I still feel it to this day and I think that I‚Äôm scarred from that experience. I need a new therapist and I‚Äôm scared about being rejected again, or not being able to find someone that I work well with. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt even know how to go about finding a new therapist. I know with my insurance that I have to make an appointment with my PCP and go and see them and talk about going back to therapy, but I‚Äôm scared. Oh well. Maybe I‚Äôll do it one day. ",bipolar

It's hard to tell because i don't always straight up see two images but sometimes I just get a general sensation of being unable to see in any sort of detail, but if I close one eye that always helps a lot. 
 
There's nothing wrong with my eyes, I've had them checked by an optician, orthoptist, and ophthalmologist for this issue. So I think it must be a brain thing, then add in that it worsens when I'm depressed makes that seem even more likely 
 
In case it's relevant, this episode looks quite different to how mine tend to look. I am more irritable and angry, not really eating (maybe not a bad thing as I am obese), not really getting any sleep (like going to bed at 11pm and waking up at 1am and struggling to get back to sleep) and feel like I am wading through blancmange, also I'm like very aware of how visibly tired I am like i can feel it all round my eyes.

Thankfully I've been stable for a bit over a year now, and I'm doing everything in my power to stay well for as long as possible. But I'm wondering how I might handle things if/when I do have a new episode. 

If I or the people close to me ever notice me developing manic symptoms, I plan to call out sick so that I don't do anything on the job that could harm my reputation or get me fired. My job requires a note from a doctor for me to be granted sick leave, but I'm worried that once the note comes from my psychiatrist, people at work will realise I have a mental health issue (even if the note itself doesn't disclose what's happening).
I live in a country that's very backwards when it comes to mental health and our anti-discrimination laws are very new. So, I don't want to risk anyone at my work getting even the slightest idea that I might have a mental illness.

I'm really scared of ruining things for myself and falling apart again (my last depressive episode put me in inpatient) and I'm in college right now so it's a battle to not stop going to school or fall behind. Does anyone have any tips for keeping your head above water when a depressive episode starts? I'm currently in a DBT group and it's been helping a lot and I've been trying to use the skills I've learned, but it's still hard. ",bipolar

"I‚Äôm just now realizing I gave up on life a couple years ago I‚Äôm a 38 year old guy. I‚Äôm married and I have 3 kids. It‚Äôs become evident to me that some time in 2022 I completely gave up on everything and I have been in a depressive state. It sort of feels like that analogy of a frog in boiling water who doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs being cooked alive until it‚Äôs too late. 

I can‚Äôt pinpoint exactly when or why this all happened but there are 2 main factors 

First, my job. I am a manager for a customer service department for a software company. I look over 3 team leads and 10 support reps. I had one team lead that over the last couple years has done EVERYTHING. Like it‚Äôs not hyperbole he basically did my job. Because of this, I‚Äôve been so far removed from the day to day activities of my team I don‚Äôt even know where to begin to get back on track.  He‚Äôs moving departments in December and I fear it‚Äôs going to be painfully obvious I haven‚Äôt been doing my job for the past 2 years. 

Second is my kids. Having kids is hard. I always wanted to be a dad but now that I am one I do t know if I‚Äôm cut out to be one. I have a 7 year old with ADHD and twin 3 year olds. My social life is non existent. There is no notion of free time in my life. I don‚Äôt have time for any hobbies not that I would know what my hobbies are to begin with. 

One other side story is in December of last year my brother took his own life. He was BP2 I‚Äôm BP1. He was the only other person I could talk to who was bipolar. We were externally close. I ended up buying our family home just a few streets down from him. 

Over the past couple months we have made some med adjustments. I do t want to list them because I do t want the post to get removed.  To be honest I am kind of craving a manic episode. Anything to feel alive again‚Ä¶ 

I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can take this. If I did t have my wife and kids I‚Äôd cash my chips in myself already. ",bipolar
"Experiencing psychotic symptoms for the first time is really scary. Previously diagnosed BP-2. Recently started experiencing psychotic symptoms which makes me strongly suspect BP-1. Waiting for my next appointment for confirmation.

   Recently I've been experiencing tactile hallucinations (formication: feeling of bugs crawling on skin). I've never hallucinated in the past to my knowledge and it's scary.
   
When it started it was only in bed and I drew the very reasonable conclusion that there must be bugs in my bed. (I have cats, it very well could have been fleas or mites of some sort.)
   
Deep into the sickeningly familiar all nighter that signals the start of my manic episode, here I am at 3AM desperately looking for bugs that I would never find. I wrote it off as them simply jumping away when I shone a light and tried and failed to sleep through the discomfort. Several nights in a row where I actually get sleep, still feeling them, but never finding them.
   
In a sleep devrived haze I attempted to self medicate my ADHD with caffeine which I have unknowingly done for years until I got my diagnosis recently. The 300mg plus the sleep deprivation triggered the hallucination again and the reality finally sunk in that I was hallucinating. What are the chances that they were in my clothes and just decided to start after I drank caffeine. I think near zero.
   
Thankfully I now have the insight that it isn't real, but it's an omen of what I can only imagine is more to come. I can't fully trust my senses anymore. It scares the shit out of me. It feels like my life is headed for a nosedive.
   
Any advice for navigating this situation would make me externally grateful.

"Lost a friendship I have a friend who I lost due to my bipolar/PTSD. She said that I never considered the trauma she had to go through helping me out, and that it was making her physically ill. I also said some things I regret about how she wasn't there for me, which I think really pushed her over the edge. A couple months ago she sent me this long text about how I had been too belligerent and confrontative when manic, and that the person she knew me as was ""well and truly gone."" But she also has not given me the chance to show that I am still here and doing a lot better than I was when this rift grew between us.

I genuinely thought this person would be my lifelong friend, and it's hard to put into words how it feels to lose her. But it hurts because she doesn't seem to register that my actions were severely impacted by mental illness and seems to blame things on my personal failings or poor choices. A mutual friend told me she suspected that this person thought I had a drug problem (a sore spot for her due to family trauma, but also untrue). She also started distancing herself from me when I began to have doubts our shared faith and felt that as a result ""our relationship could never be what it was.""

I don't know...I wish I could have the chance to regain her trust. I'm respecting her boundaries, but I'm considering sending her a birthday present and it's got me in my head. Has anyone had experiences with rebuilding trust? Forgiving people for being human and unable to support you in your illness?",bipolar
"My friend is grieving, how do I stay supportive while maintaining self care?  My best friend is also bipolar. His (afab) sister went through her first psychotic break (undiagnosed) and left this world. I have already been having nightmares the last couple weeks and I have ptsd from my first psychotic episode so I‚Äôm always analyzing my own symptoms. I woke up to a text saying his sister passed away. I reaffirmed that it was no one‚Äôs fault that it happened and that having emotions about the situation are okay. I‚Äôve offered to spend the day with them, bring them food later, and made sure they have a support system with them at the moment so that they are safe. 

I want to be a supportive friend but how do I also maintain boundaries to support my own health? I feel I may become too consumed and empathetic to the situation having similar health issues and begin to spiral. ",bipolar

"How do you reconcile the effects of bipolar rage and how you are perceived TLDR: How do you reconcile the long term effects bipolar rage takes on the public perceptions of who you are; With self perception and how other people perceive you.

I had a 1:1 with my boss and I asked him if I've been 'too much' recently. 

I've been 'in my ways' now for a little bit and I'm only now piecing that together.  The rage is so bad.  It's not all the time, but anything that would upset me gives me the same full body reaction that seeing someone kick my dog would.  The immediate fire in my veins and the pressure against my bulwark of control breaks.  I feel so justified in the moment and even for a time after.  I'll swear in ways that scare me, wish curses upon the things 'against me',  i'll thrash and punch the air, grit my teeth (did i really growl?), blow out my voice screaming in the car.  I come with facts, reasons, explanations, it IS everyone else that did this to me...at least that's how I feel at the time.  

I yelled at my landlord for cutting down a brush pile, he is so nice and caring, he didn't deserve that.  I love the birds and animals that visited it; I talk to them at my birdfeeder every morning, they center me.  My feelings are valid, my reactions are not.  This isn't the first time it's happened recently.  I can feel him souring on me.  Asking my partner if I'm mad at him. 

My boss told me that people walk on eggshells around me, and that it's not just those in my department now.  We recently moved to an 'open office' (what a joke.  talk about the worst thing for productivity, and a nightmare for managing bipolar).  We're a very small company all in one room now; and with no where to hide, everyone gets to experience 'me' for the first time.  I'm friendly when not enraged,  I'm very friendly, people like me and would go out of their way to talk to me.  I stand out visually, i'm goofy, i like to bring happiness and spontaneity to the work place.  It's actually been a problem before, where i have to hide to get work done just because people want to talk to me all the time. 

This has changed since the move; My rage in the lab echos out into the open room.  i see it in how people talk to me.  they don't joke around out of the blue anymore.  they don't greet me with fun gestures.  I'm scary now.  What was fun about me is now a warning sign. 

I'm sure my boss knows I'm bipolar.  He's confided things to me on late night drives out to testing labs.  He was happy to see me leave the office or start going on walks when the rage kicks in.  I told him this is something that happens outside of work too, and I'm aware and working on being better.  I'll never actually say it, and he'll never actually call it by name.  I'm thankful for that.  

It's just so hard knowing that the person i am and want to be has to contend with the person i'm overtaken by; that is out to destroy Me on such a fundamental level. I feel like being a recluse against my social wants is the only way to keep people safe; to keep my public persona safe.  It's like being a werewolf, only i don't know when the change happens. 

I'm on my rescue meds now.  i'm working from home until i'm more certain i'm okay.  How does everyone deal with the long term effects on who you are?  How do you apologize.  I know there's no going back, and time is the only way things can heal, but any outburst entrenches things deeper.  It just sucks to know that who i 'am' is controlled so much by forces outside of me. ",bipolar
"Got Sober and Found a Job Hello my fellow Bipolar Warriors. I was diagnosed with type 1 about 15 years or so ago and have been playing roulette with meds since then. I was a huge pothead and alcoholic for a lot of years, but I now have 76 days sober. Sobriety has helped my mental health immensely and I am experiencing my longest period of stability in years. I also found a job driving special needs kids to and from school and Iove it. It pays well and I really enjoy the work.

"So this is what it feels like to be on the other side of an episode. I have bipolar and so does my friend. We aren't super close, but I've known her for a few years. It seems like she's in an episode right now because she's not acting like herself and she's very paranoid about things that simply aren't true.

I've totally been there! I was trying to support her, and I was gently asking some stuff to see where she was at. I was trying to share what I knew was true, but she didn't believe me. I think I pissed her off because now she's not talking to me.

I know there's nothing I can do except give her space and wait for her to cycle out. This illness is so maddening. I'm not used to being on the other side of it. Today has really given me some perspective on my past episodes and what I've put my family through. It feels kind of terrible. But at the same time, I'm so thankful for stability and that my family never gave up on me.

I don't want to give up on my friend, even if she's pushing me away right now. Maybe I can try reaching out again in a couple weeks or a month.",bipolar
"Just want to rant  Just wanna talk. 

In a manic state, I usually get myself in predicaments that I can‚Äôt really get out for a while. A couple years ago I got myself into so much debt because I took out loans just so I can spend it all on nonsense. I‚Äôm still reeling from all that and getting my credit back on track. 

This time, while not as bad, I decided I would be a soccer coach. Bad idea. I know enough about soccer to yell out on the sidelines but coaching an entire team how to play and what to do? 

I should‚Äôve known with my anxiety that it wouldn‚Äôt have worked. But I did it. Luckily, the season is almost up. But I had a parent call me out publicly about how bad I‚Äôm doing.   It really sucked. Really hurt my feelings. 

I didn‚Äôt expect to be the best of the best or anything. But it still hurt. My depression has come full force and that‚Äôs one of the things driving me down further. 

I‚Äôm definitely not doing that again. 

Update to anyone reading this: 

I learned tonight during the last practice that the rest of the parents and all the kids want me to coach again and they request me. I was thinking I let these kids down while the whole time being the supportive/encouraging coach the kids needed. 

May have been the best impulsive decision I‚Äôve made yet. ",bipolar

"Coworkers keep making negative comments and jokes about bipolar I have had a long mental health history since I was 14, and 3 1/2 years ago I had my first full blown manic episode and was officially diagnosed with BP1 and started on mood stabilizers. I am very lucky that the right meds and therapy worked like absolute magic for me. I have maybe one mild episode a year now, and no one who has met me since I started meds would guess that I‚Äôm bipolar. Only my close friends and family know. 

1 1/2 years ago, I started a new job that I love and have grown to be good friends with most of my coworkers. For the most part, it is a healthy work environment. Many of them openly talk about being in therapy for less-stigmatized illnesses like depression and anxiety, and generally know that I receive mental health care too, but they have assumed it‚Äôs for ADHD and anxiety and have absolutely no idea of how severe my symptoms used to be. 

Despite having their own mental struggles and thinking of themselves as progressive, they regularly make ignorant jokes and comments about less socially accepted disorders like bipolar, schizophrenia, autism. Lately they have been making comments claiming that random people who they dislike ‚Äúmust be bipolar‚Äù and have started to pick up on me consistently changing the conversation, correcting them, or not finding it funny. As we‚Äôve hung out more it‚Äôs also been harder to avoid talking about my past and hiding the impact that mental illness has had on my life. 

I‚Äôm not someone who can be silent when others say hurtful things, but I also don‚Äôt know how to stop the comments without them getting suspicious of me. I‚Äôve ‚Äúcome out‚Äù as bipolar to other friends and used my experience to educate others on bipolar before, but I feel that I can‚Äôt do that this time as they are also my coworkers

"When meds go wrong Hi everyone, alright so a little story about my week. I should start with how I spoke to fellow patients at the hospital‚Ä¶hi my name is (patient #) and this is my week. I started with working the beginning of the week, I was very low on a depression, the third week precisely, I was self harming and and just all around felt bad. The previous week I saw my psychiatrist who briefly listened to my issue and prescribed more meds. Forward to the next week at work, at this point I‚Äôm on all my meds including the new one. 

Before the end of the day as I‚Äôm holding a nineteen thousand dollar piece of equipment (I work as a contractor for the U.S. govt and military is all I can say) I started to shake and fell to the floor, losing consciousness and the ability to get up. After getting help and the on staff nurse getting me up on a stretcher I came to and next thing I know I‚Äôm sent to the hospital. They noticed the harm on my body and I was baker acted. 

I spent five days in the mental hospital, sharing a room with a fellow inmate (lol) i got worse before getting better. I slept that night and most of the next day, missing breakfast but they woke me for my meds, which I tried refusing as I trusted no one and was paranoid. Later that day the hospital‚Äôs psychiatrist came to see me, I was laying down, crying, scared and not sure what to do anymore. He was talking but I didn‚Äôt understand him at first. Then he tells me about my meds. He mentioned that seizures are highly possible when I take two meds together that cause them. I ask which ones, one I was taking and the new one I was on, he mentioned they shouldn‚Äôt be taken together. 

I felt betrayed at my current dr who prescribed me the meds but it made me think I should have checked too, I‚Äôm the one taking them, I saw so mad at myself. He got me off my old med and started the new one, two days later I felt more together, and began participating with others in group activities and the various food schedule. I was getting better pretty quick, I noticed I stuttered a lot more than usual, I was also tested for autism but I knew I had been already. Once I felt better I still had a little over two days there, so I coped by talking to others who were with it, and helped those who weren‚Äôt getting it. Especially by the staff who looked down on us for our conditions, you‚Äôll know which ones do this. 

I helped a young girl by getting her off walls that she was hitting her head on and got someone to talk to her (I‚Äôm very socially anxious, I could only do so much) as well as walk slower with a lady using a walker so not only to help her but to be there to listen to what she had to say. I even got a lonely shy girl company to some bubbly personality‚Äôs that I knew she felt safe with. While the staff paid attention to the medical side, I loved being able to help with the social side of the hospital. I didn‚Äôt feel suicidal or want to harm myself anymore, I just wanted to help again. 

I‚Äôm afraid of becoming my worse self but I understood when I was there that everyone has their own battles, and life‚Äôs never perfect but to keep yourself in check and get the help you need as soon as possible, if your dr can‚Äôt see you soon during a crisis, please go to the hospital or find a dr who can see you. It could have been much worse for me, I could have been driving that day, but I was lucky, and met some truly amazing people like the rest of us. Thank you for reading. ",bipolar

I am losing hope. Despite doing everything right, down to the meds, sleep and excersise routines; I can feel my will to live is slipping.

This is affecting my entire life. I'm not contacting my friends or family on and off from one week to the next, because I simply lack the mental ressources to do so. It seems to come in waves too, one week can barely cope, next week full recluse - repeat.

"A Poem I Wrote This is a poem dedicated to all those who struggle with or love someone with bipolar disorder. I acknowledge the incredible courage, strength, loyalty and love that is required to stay.  

Waves 

Cyclical, predictable 
Yet
Each unique
The intense, tumultuous rush
The slow, steady retreat 

Crashing into everything 
Crash
Crash
Crash
Crash

Unrelenting
Unsteady
Unpredictable 

Retreat 

The quiet 
The darkness 
The grief 
The calm 
But 
It will be high tide again before long

And then low tide again
High
Low
High
Low
Can we predict it? 
The moon has control 

Sometimes steady
Sometimes churning
Sometimes blissful
Sometimes calm



Sometimes gone 



But I choose.

To remain.

For it all.

I stay 
I change
I stay
I long 
I stay
I feel
I stay
For it all

Even when the sand hardens and cracks 
As I look around
I parch and I wither
And I‚Äôm dying to drown

I stay 
I stay
I stay
I stay 

Because off in the distance 
When I‚Äôm about to give in
I see it
A wave 
Returning


In staying there is wisdom
It returns 
Always
To quench my soul 
And remind me
Why
I
Stay.",bipolar
"Hypomania becoming less and less I have tried a few medications at this point and the new one I'm on does seem to be helping alot. The thing I've noticed is my ""hypomania"" doesn't seem to last as long. I get very irritated and angry for no reason but lately it's seem to come and go in a day or so. Instead of effecting me for like a week or longer. Does it ever seem to go away completely at least for a while? Or does it always seem to have a presence in your life? ",bipolar

"The feeling of falling within myself  Feeling like I‚Äôm falling psychically 

Hi, y‚Äôall. I have bipolar 1 with psychosis, for which I recently was hospitalized. I‚Äôve been out about 10 days and was starting to feel a lot better but today I experienced something I haven‚Äôt before. I have had thoughts of suicide which I usually make a joke of and brush aside, which usually puts an end to the train of thought. But today, after a rough day where I was catfished and they attempted to get extort me because I stupidly was snap chatting them videos (I was cognizant enough not to put my face in anything), and also I found out the woman I love is seeing and very happy with someone else. 

I was dazed by all of that yesterday, and today as I was still processing everything after I got home a feeling overtook me that felt like I was rootless and falling within myself with no end to it in sight (my usually joking manner was off the table). This lasted about thirty minutes before I was able to bring myself to the shower which snapped me out of it partially, at least enough where I wasn‚Äôt feeling afraid in my gut like I was. 

I‚Äôve never taken anything about my suicidal thoughts seriously, there has always been a distance in my mind between the thoughts and how I feel about life and my prospects. This experience was qualitatively different and I feel afraid that I am being undercut by the currents of my life, it was like I wasn‚Äôt present- there was only the pain and discomfort pulling me away from myself. I guess I‚Äôm wondering if this resonates with anyone here, I‚Äôve never felt so lonely in my life. Music and nicotine can only do so much work, I‚Äôve never feared my own psyche so much even with my psychoses. Thanks.

"Grieving the loss of my dog and trying to prevent episodes I unfortunately am putting my dog down tomorrow at 11am, and while she is 15 years old and a huge dog it still feels devastating. I was extremely grieve-stricken  for Tuesday and Wednesday launching into a short depressive episode when i was told. And resorted to drinking to relieve the sorrow, an old habit i haven‚Äôt done in a year. The appointment is happening and i know it‚Äôs the right thing to do, and i am spending as much time as i can with her. But it feels like apathetic episode, like is this going to give closure and more importantly make her know she was loved? 

The bipolar part of this, is there any advice you guys can give me to grieve properly with bipolar. These things usually invoke a huge emotional toll and after mixed existential episodes. And i have such a hard time managing emotions

And i already have contacted my therapist, journaled, and have family and friends. Some who will be with me. But i just don‚Äôt know if it will be enough  

And I am so lost and scared, and hoping more than ever there is a god. And scared she will give me the same eyes she did when i picked her from the litter box.

Thank you in advance.

"I think a manic episode is trying to happen  To summarize everything, I just I feel like I stoped potentially triggering a manic episode before anything happened, because I feel fine now and I had someone to help me and keep me in reality


I don't know how to explain it so bear with me. I woke up and felt like I was going to have a bad day even tho I felt fine. I got to work and everything started to go wrong. Everyone was a tad bit meaner and everything just somehow went wrong too.
I work overnights so there being no sun didn't really make me feel better.

And then I started getting the most horrible cramps and it felt like if I didn't get out of their right now I was going to freak out on someone or cry uncontrollably and would probably lose my job, so I collected my self and asked to leave home early.

Once I got home and I got undressed and went to sleep I started freaking out. I was seeing things even tho I knew nothing was their I was freaked out. My partner held me and talked to me even tho they where half asleep they helped me until I calmed down and fell asleep. In those moments I remember thinking that if I didn't calm down I would trigger something cuz I felt my grip on reality start slipping away and I was so close to losing my
shit.

Their could be a couple reasons, i've been dealing with a lot and came to realize that I probably have BPD on top of my Bipolar 1 and PTSD. And it's been a lot of weird feelings but a lot of understanding why I am the way I am. And I also got out of a relationship like 4 months ago and just entered a new one(we clicked really fast). And also I'm In follicular phase of mv period so I feel energized but not overly energized I just feel like always have the right amount of energy even if I'm tired and sleep deprived.

"I‚Äôm just tired. That‚Äôs all. I really don‚Äôt ask my family/friends for anything, but I feel like such a burden. I just hate myself. Everytime I open up to someone, I just feel like a burden. My best friend tells me I‚Äôm not, but I feel otherwise. 

Last year I finally decided to open up to my aunt about my mental health, and she basically said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs kids out here with cancer‚Äù. Belittling my mental health. Ofc I feel for the kids or anyone with cancer, but this isn‚Äôt a competition, and I never opened up to her again. I ended up admitting myself into the hospital, and that‚Äôs when I found out that I have Bipolar Disorder. I knew I had depression for years though. 

My mom passed in front of me when I was 17 (I‚Äôm 21 now) she always understood me. Even before she passed, I struggled with depression, but she never judged me. She also struggled with depression, but she was so strong. Only 35 when she passed. Young. My world just flipped upside down completely after that. My friends still have their moms, so they don‚Äôt understand. 

I always isolate myself when I get into these moods. I‚Äôm not talking to anyone because I feel like I‚Äôll just wear them down. I deactivated all my main socials (instagram and tiktok) I‚Äôve even turned my messages off, so my messages won‚Äôt go through.

Dreams This dream is different.  I watched as an old man poured gasoline under his mobile home to get the hogs out. They had escaped their pin that sits beside the trailer and are now digging themselves in under the trailer. A flame suddenly started and the Mobile home was now engulfed in flames. The hogs quickly ran out and went back to their pin. At the same time the flame devoured the trailer the neighbors are piling bags of trash against the trailer and they are catching fire. Funny thing though the neighbors all had my face. The old man had my face and so did his wife. The old man and wife then went into the trailer as if nothing is happening and the neighbors and I are just watching the flame devour everything.,bipolar

"My parents got mad at me for intentionally overdosing Hopefully this doesn't break rule 12 because I'm okay now. A couple months ago I got into a friendship ending fight and I got so upset that I overdosed. I don't know if it was a suicide attempt or not but I really regretted it, because I overdosed just a week before that and I went to work while I was blacking out and vomiting, so I got really scared and called my biological dad.


My biological dad was... more disappointed, and scared, than irritated. Because he told me to call him before this happens again just a couple hours before I did this (I told him about my previous attempt). He started yelling at me to tell my step-dad and my biological mom. So I went to tell them, but I didn't want them to know I overdosed, so I just told them my stomach hurt and I think I ""accidentally"" took too much medication.


My step-dad said he didn't want to take me to the hospital over a ""stomach ache"" even though I told him I was really scared. So I called my bio-dad again and let him know what was going on and he demanded I told my parents the truth. So I went back out there and handed my step-dad the phone, and my bio-dad told my step-dad it was an intentional overdose.


My bio-dad by this point was getting really upset and threatened to call the police if he didn't take me to the hospital. This really pissed off my step-dad and he threatened to call the police on my bio-dad for... whatever. And they got into this fight and then they hung up. And the police called my phone, basically telling me they're not doctors and that if I want to go to the hospital then I should.


This pissed off my bio-dad even more and eventually he dragged me off to the hospital to where I was taken to inpatient care.


Before he showed up, my mom woke up and asked what was going on. My step-dad explained and she got super irritated, telling me I was ""waking her up"", that I was ""being mean"", I should've ""known better than to overdose"", and then she went back to bed. My step-dad got really pissed at me, didn't answer me when I started talking to him, just shook his head and sighed and went back to bed.


I don't know what to do. It's been a couple months now and they're no longer acting mad at me, they're just acting like nothing happened except for the fact my two dads now hate each others guts. And it's my own fucking fault.


My abusive mom and my step-dad who let it all happen. Of course they don't care about me that much. They might act like they love and care about me, who the fuck does that to someone who overdosed and is telling you ""I'm bipolar and I'm going to kill myself?""


I hope this isn't breaking rule 12. I am okay and I don't want to currently hurt myself. I just need to tell someone and I don't know who. It hurts so bad.",bipolar
"Any 50+ bipolars out there? CW: SI 50F, diagnosed BP-II at 41 after being incorrectly diagnosed as MDD for the previous 16 years. For the last 5 years or so, I have become increasingly just ""done"" with life. My physical health is beginning to decline; joint pain, early-stage kidney disease, digestive problems, a stomach that looks like I'm pregnant with twins. It has become impossible to determine which of my mood/physical symptoms are a failure/result of my meds versus perimenopause.

With the average lifespan of bipolar people being 10-20 years less than the general population, I fluctuate between ""make the most of what remains"" and ""I can't do this another 10 years."" Lately the latter has been winning. The SI is a near-daily passenger. It's all depression, all of the time- no mania at all since 2019-ish.

My current health insurance is hot garbage, so seeking adequate treatment has become tougher, with appeals/referrals sometimes taking months. My psych isn't in-plan, so every appointment is $175. The possibility that my treatment-resistant depression is the result of years of incorrect meds makes me furious. When I see posts of people diagnosed in their 20s, I hope like hell they can find the right drug regimen early, and that they are able to benefit from any future research focused on bipolar.

"Random Question Hey bipolar fam, I got a question for you!

I recently created a crisis plan for both manic and depressive episodes and I found that while I was working on it, and in the period after it was complete I felt FUCKING INCREDIBLE.

Not in a mania sort of way, but it felt like I had control, or was taking control back and it made me feel like there WAS something I could do to change things.

Problem is, is was a sort of fleeting moment.  I‚Äôm still really proud of it, and I‚Äôve used it to check myself periodically and it‚Äôs been super helpful in terms of educating people around me.

My question for you all:

Do you have any documents / educational materials you‚Äôve created with regard to your care that you think might be useful to mimic?

"Irritability / anger 41F, bipolar 1. 

I'm inpatient at the moment having my lithium levels stabilized (and other stuff, it's been a rough year) but over the last week I've noticed something completely new - I'm fine in the morning but around lunchtime things start to irritate me very easily. By midafternoon I'm quietly hostile and that progresses to snapping at people and feeling extremely angry over things that are insignificant. For example, I was in an art therapy group and had to leave because the woman next to me was *coloring too loudly.*

I'm usually very patient, tolerant and happy-go-lucky, when I get sick any anger I feel is turned inward. Feeling this way is completely foreign to me and I'm struggling to cope. My psych said it's not uncommon in bipolar and we're keeping an eye on it but because the lithium is currently high I'm on half my normal dose, which he doesn't want to increase back up until we work out why it's gone so high.

I've snapped at a few nurses (and apologized of course!) and I'm worried that I'll act out of anger and do something worse.

"Told my illness to go fuck itself How its always worked is five bad months, one ""getting-better"" month, 1 good week, a few days manic, get fired and pick up the pieces. For years. Then one day after a year of therapy I was able to make it two months, and being normal for two months was the greatest thing to have ever happened to me.

Then I got the chance to do it again and I fucked it up. It was looking like another five months of everything sucking. Getting kicked out of school, etc, etc, and the typical late 20s mental illness party train.

But I said no. Went up on my meds. Started caffiene (methylfinadate) maeks me manic, and starting all my coping mechanisms over again. Its not certain, nothings certain but its working. I think I'm back in the game. My illness is fighting back, but I'm stubborn as a mule in mud (and love that about myself). This time the story ends with surviving.

"Newly diagnosed with bipolar I recently was told that I have bipolar 2. I had my suspicions for some years that I was because my depression never really felt like normal depression but something much deeper and sometimes much darker.

It's been a lot to process. Finding out has brought a lot of emotions. Some of them have been shame because of the stigma around mental health and what I've seen. There has been a lot of finding out and thinking back to a lot of things, just going ""that makes sense now, that adds up."" Between those feelings, a lot of things started to add up as to why when I felt a certain way in a depressive episode, I had no explanation as to why I felt that way, I just felt that way for no actual reason.

Recently I had, what I am realizing now a mixed episode that is a big reason that I decided to be very open and vulnerable in therapy about how I've been feeling and how low the lows truly do get. I've been looking back at things and the signs of it were always there and a lot of times I just said I was going through a lot (I have had dealt with a lot of trauma) and it was nothing else other than that. Now things have began to make sense in my life and it's began to help me truly understand myself even more than I have before.

-having either really slow or fast thoughts that I can't talk away 







-talking quickly, so quickly that my clients have noticed 








-just feeling like dogshit in general, except for the periods where I'm over happy










-needing less sleep (this is big. And when I sleep it's like blink I'm asleep blink it's hours later, I don't feel like my mind got to rest) 








-forgetting/denying myself food 








-unsafe sexual activity (I'm usually really good about this) 












-so much irritability

This has been going on for at least three weeks,probably longer but it's been bad recently 








I guess I'm just sharing to remind myself that this isnt permanent. It's never been permanent before and it won't be this time, that's the thing about this disorder lol

"Just need to get this off my chest  I start a new med today and I am a combination of fearful and optimistic. It‚Äôs the first time an antipsychotic has been added to my regimen, and in a weird way, it feels like I failed. I‚Äôm in danger of losing my job (for the millionth time) thanks to this cursed disorder so I‚Äôm getting desperate to find a way to live better with these mood swings and stay employed and safe.  

Some background: I had my first manic episode in 2016, absolutely spurred by SSRI‚Äôs, and while I almost made the ultimate permanent decision to depart the planet, I was able to get help and that led to my bipolar I diagnosis, and the real work began.  

With proper support and meds, and essentially quitting alcohol, I stabilized for the most part by 2019. But then 2020 happened, and as someone who lives in the US during such an intense time, I backslid in a big way with my mental health. For the last 4 years I‚Äôve been going up and down like a yo-yo, on an overall downward trajectory. I‚Äôve cycled through multiple trades jobs since then, and early this year landed a carpentry job. I love the work so much, am learning a lot, and my natural creativity is a boon to this work.  

Unfortunately, my boss (who I was friends with before getting the job, and still am) had to talk with me about my mood swings. It was done kindly but firmly, and I don‚Äôt resent him in the slightest, but I am embarrassed and dejected about still feeling like a friggen slave to this disorder.  

So for the last 4 years, I‚Äôve said ‚Äúno‚Äù to many medications because of the work I do. I‚Äôm highly sensitive to medication changes, even small adjustments make me feel off for a few weeks. So even when things are extra activated, I‚Äôm still refusing to try new meds that can possibly help. My refusal is always based on the demands of capitalism and the potentially life-ending tools and machines I use as a tradie. I can‚Äôt be dizzy or sleepy or jumpy when using a table saw or router, it‚Äôs unsafe for me and others in the shop/ on the job site. So I am always saying no to med adjustments so I can try to keep my head clear (lol), until last week.  

As an American, and a leftist at that, the last few weeks have been especially hellish. I saw myself spiraling, and foolishly thought I was masking it well enough at work, so I was crushed when my boss had to have a talk with me, as I‚Äôm apparently killing the morale. Real, but ouch, but real.  

I had a depressing revelation after that talk, when discussing with my psychiatrist what happened at work and how my mental health is tanking: I don‚Äôt know if I can do work like this much longer. I kept choosing to stay on the current regimen of meds so I can safely use the tools of my trade, but my mood is canceling out any progress I make in my jobs. **It feels like there is no job in existence that wouldn‚Äôt make my mental health worse.** And believe me, I‚Äôve tried to do a little bit of everything. I‚Äôm almost fucking 40 and still don‚Äôt know where I belong, and feel like any progress I make in a job is dashed upon the rocky shore of cold reality as soon as my mood becomes too intense to mask.  

I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm heartbroken. Just needed to vent. And I‚Äôm crossing all my fingers and toes hoping that this new antipsychotic will help balance my broken brain so that MAYBE someday I can actually have a career, or at the very least, not have to live paycheck to paycheck.

"I‚Äôm extremely susceptible to religious/spiritual mania. Help! I‚Äôm trying to ground myself right now as I type this.

I tend to identify as agnostic, leaning towards atheist, but I grew up Catholic. I find my mania is usually kicked off by some kind of spiritual event.

The first time I noticed this happening was last year. During my sophomore year of college, there was a joke on campus that a cult-like frat summoned the demon Furfur. I fully bought in and was terrified. I prayed fervently, hail-Marys over and over. I didn‚Äôt go to class, but I did go to my college‚Äôs career fair that day where I tracked down my friends and warned them of the demon on the loose. I calmed down by the end of the day, and in the morning I had to send out embarrassed apologies to all of my friends who were very scared and startled at me, their typically level-headed friend, warning them of a demon in the form of a deer come to burn down our school.

Now, today; I‚Äôm at work right now. I work in an office so I was listening to a podcast while I work. One of the podcasts mentioned a book listing many demons and what they do called The Lesser Key of Solomon.

Immediately, I found a pdf of the book on my phone and dropped what I was doing at work to read the whole thing in about 10 minutes (I‚Äôm a fast reader naturally and the manic-high made it even faster). I decided I wanted to try to summon one of the demons in the book for personal reasons. I researched the demon and made a plan to summon it to get what I desire from it. I even applied to get approved access to a restricted demonology subreddit to get advice on summoning it.

Just wanted to share with all of you how I‚Äôm feeling right now. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with bipolar (type 3, I think, my psychiatrist is not sure) 5 months ago. I‚Äôm on humor stabilizer medication since the beginning of the year growing now to 300mg.
Anyway, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs normal or not, but my mood swings are quite drastic and quick and I‚Äôm feeling hopeless and overwhelmed. I spend my days alone because I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends and I keep canceling plans anyway. I feel like nobody understands me, and I think sometimes I even sabotage my relationships because Im afraid deep down they will leave me anyway at some point. I think I‚Äôm too much for them. Like a burden. I hate complaining or saying this stuff, but it is true to my heart.
I just wanted to know your experience, if you think maybe my medication is not working or if it is normal to have these mood swings after a few months and growing medication? Is it still a process? I mean, sometimes I‚Äôm good but there are days where I my thoughts are very dark and suicidal. I‚Äôm feeling desperate, I have health issues now because when I feel low I find refuge on fast food, and now that I have to change my food routine, it‚Äôs freaking me out too, because if that changes too, what pleasure will I have if I keep feeling like shit? What refuge or little pleasure will I find to cope? It‚Äôs a rollercoaster and I feel like I can‚Äôt get out of it and just rest.

I feel alone, solitude sucks man, it really sucks. It‚Äôs been years I feel like this, now it gets worse and I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs related to my medication, maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking it? Sometimes I think I‚Äôm not bipolar, I don‚Äôt know why. I‚Äôm afraid medication is turning me into this, it‚Äôs been a rough year.
I‚Äôm sorry, it‚Äôs a lot, I just needed to write it out.
 
Either way, I read your messages and it feels good to feel less alone. Like somebody understands a little, or a lot. I feel seen. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing here.

"update Recently switched psychiatrists since my last psych was hot garbage and were planning to wait two months I was not willing to wait to even thoroughly assess me, let alone medicate me (my symptoms are through the roof atm its been a rollercoaster trying to keep myself safe). Going to be reassessed on the 13th with a much better group that knows what they are doing so I‚Äôm happy about that. 

My question is, I can‚Äôt tell whether I‚Äôm fluctuating rapidly between mania and depression, or if this is a ‚Äúmixed‚Äù state. I‚Äôm surely going to know when I start having frequent sessions. But for now, to ease my mind and help me explain my symptoms to my family and close friends who‚Äôd like to assist me, what would you say?

I pretty much have all manic symptoms minus rapid speech when I‚Äôm not actually in my bed. So extreme reserves of energy, racing thoughts, invincible (both happy and brash, like nobody could ever shoot me down and succeed) mood, the lack of impulse control, etc. But I‚Äôve simultaneously never ever felt this tired in my life. So I‚Äôve been sleeping up to 18 hours a day, unable to get out of bed until i sleep at-least 12 hours. But whilst bed-bound, I feel restless. I work on my book, I apply for jobs, things I can‚Äôt necessarily do when I‚Äôm straight up depressed. Now that I‚Äôm typing it out it seems much clearer.

"Should I date this person?/What needs do you need in a partnership?  For context, I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 after a 4-month long manic episode 3 years ago. I have since been medicated and have been ‚Äústable‚Äù, not experiencing anything more severe than the occasional hypomania and rapid cycling.

I just started dating someone who I met three months ago. We have been communicating really well on what we‚Äôre looking for and our needs/desires in a potential relationship. We‚Äôre both in our early-mid twenties and lesbians, not that it really matters. 

Yesterday, I opened up about having Bipolar letting them know how I process my emotions, why it‚Äôs important to me that someone I date knows this and understands what bipolar is (my last partner thought bipolar and BPD were the same thing and they were a psychology major‚Ä¶), and also asked them to think about this to reflect on whether or not they want to date someone with bipolar.

They‚Äôve been so receptive and empathetic to this point, so I was expecting a comforting reaction. As assumptions tend to be, that was a bit off course. Instead, they told me about how they have always had fears of ‚Äúgoing crazy‚Äù (their words, not mine) and have anxiety around the thought of ‚Äúgetting locked up‚Äù. They don‚Äôt suffer from any severe mental illness, so I guess this comes from a combination of societal messages and the fear around existential thinking.

ANYWAYS, they further went on to say that they could not be a person to support someone in a manic state of mind, basically. I wasn‚Äôt expecting that, I am very independent and try to seek my main support through my therapist and safety network I‚Äôve built, but I‚Äôm worried that this person will be afraid of me if I do ever have a manic episode while dating.

Is this person safe to date? what do you look in a partner to be supportive of you? ",bipolar

I know he‚Äôs not for me for so many reasons, and part of me would be worried about my physical safety with him. I‚Äôm just having such a tough time at work, and everything that happened with the election. Even before the election I was struggling with my mental health stuff. I know it‚Äôs what I call crazy person behavior, I know it‚Äôs the wrong choice, but right now I seem to be incapable of making a better one. ",bipolar
"Am I the only one who dives headfirst into relationships when I‚Äôm manic? Am I the only one who dives headfirst into relationships when I‚Äôm manic?

For a long time, I knew something wasn‚Äôt right inside me, but I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it. It wasn‚Äôt until I went to therapy and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 19 that it started to make sense. Now, at 23, I can see how each of my three relationships was really a way to distract myself from the chaos in my mind. I‚Äôve been carrying the weight of sexual trauma, too, which has made me hypersexual. When I look back, I realize I didn‚Äôt genuinely love any of them‚ÄîI was just convincing myself that I did, maybe because I was so scared of being alone or facing my own pain.

Each relationship turned toxic, one after the other. I know I had a part in it. I forced myself to believe they were everything, that I loved them, and I depended on them so heavily that it was like I couldn‚Äôt breathe without them. Every day, my mood and self-worth revolved around them. And then, when things ended, it felt like my whole world shattered. I‚Äôd be left sleepless, unable to eat, and begging to be taken back, calling them constantly because I couldn‚Äôt bear the emptiness. Looking back now, I see it wasn‚Äôt love‚Äîit was this unhealthy, all-consuming obsession, fueled by this desperate need to feel close to someone, anyone.

Right now, it feels unbearable. I just got out of another relationship a month ago, and even though I chased him and poured so much into it, now I hate him, and I hate myself for even being with him. The regret is overwhelming. I feel like I don‚Äôt even know what real love is, like maybe I‚Äôm just broken inside, doomed to keep repeating this painful cycle. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me, but this disorder is tearing me apart. Does anyone feel this way ? It‚Äôs like meeting someone and they quickly become your whole world. You get so attached, so wrapped up in them that every part of who they are feels perfect, like they were meant for you. The obsession runs deep‚Äîyou love every detail, every moment, and it feels like you couldn‚Äôt live without them. But the second they hurt you, it‚Äôs like a switch flips. Suddenly, everything you once adored about them turns into something you resent. That connection that felt so intense turns painful, and all those little things you loved now just remind you of the hurt.

It‚Äôs a cycle of extreme highs and lows, where love feels all-consuming one minute, and then the next, you‚Äôre filled with anger and regret. It‚Äôs such a confusing and exhausting way to love because every moment feels like everything‚Äîuntil it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like everything felt so real, but looking back, it was all built on lust and attraction. The connection felt intense, almost overwhelming, but maybe it was just the rush, the thrill, and not a deeper bond. I think I was seeing something that wasn‚Äôt really there‚Äîjust creating a version of them in my mind that I wanted to believe in.

Maybe I was just caught up, delusional, and manic, swept away in the high of it all. Then, when it was over, it‚Äôs like the illusion fell apart, leaving me with nothing but the emptiness. It‚Äôs as if my whole world shatters each time, and I‚Äôm left wondering if any of it was ever real or if I was just trying to fill a void.",bipolar
"struggling with recent diagnosis of Bipolar 2. advice welcome! I have never really posted before so i don't know if this is what this is for or not but here we go. 



I was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2, at first i was terrified to get diagnosed  i  knew in my core long before i made the appointment as i had a family history of it. after being terrified with just thinking of being diagnosed now i am terrified that this will be my  life forever, i have always felt that life for me was a constant fight that i could never win but i kept up the good fight as that was what was expected of me no matter how much i wanted to lay down and give up some unseen force has always driven me to fight back  and push long after i have given up the fight goes on. Now i know the fight is real and not just something i was making up and i'm exhausted and still want to give up but cant i march ever forward. 

it's weird knowing that these thoughts are mine but not mine, i feel and dont feel this way, i take the pills and no change. I take more pills and still no change in therapy i dont think its helping i don't know what to do or what to say i always know what to do and what to say before i go anywhere i have to that's how i survived this long.

When will i see the light at the end, is there even a light at the end. everything i keep reading says it gets worse as you age and here i am at 31 just getting diagnosed and looking back i can see that i have been dealing with this since i was 11 and i didnt have help no one knew i didn't even know i just found ways to work around it and make situations work for me or found ways to avoid them if i knew i couldn't make it work. 

I hold myself to such a high standard i wonder does this diagnoses even matter i have been pushing through it for this long what's the rest of my life anyways really if i can make it this long i can make it to the end right?

maybe it's not real maybe i am just saying all the right buzz words regurgitating them back like a parrot and making everyone else believe that i am bipolar but what if i am not and i'm just fooling everyone around me.

  
i still don't even understand what this means bipolar 2 i have googled and read a millions posts that all seem like stories of my own and it almost convinced me maybe they are right maybe this is the answer and maybe the end is in sight and i can be normal. that's all i have ever wanted was to be normal that's why i work so hard to pretend and be the person everyone expects i put on the mask and everything is ok.

i just want to be normal is that ever going to happen and if it does am i going to miss myself like so many others i have seen post?

i'm sorry i just had to share with someone anyone really i don't know if i want answers or not but just writing this out has made me feel better. 

  
Please share with me how you felt when you found out, i would love to hear how others have coped with this and maybe i can find some peace in responses.

"Diagnose Hi! I‚Äôm new to bipolar and am interested in hearing about hearing your guys‚Äô journey to getting the diagnosis and proper treatment, along with any advice or answers to some questions!! 

I met with my psychiatrist and they prescribed me a medication for bipolar II typically I think, although I feel like he didn‚Äôt really listen to me during the appointment and kept rushing it. Looking at the after visit notes they weren‚Äôt that accurate either and had things that we didn‚Äôt discuss or things that I said the opposite of. I‚Äôve been to my primary care doctor and neurologist and everything comes up normal for that, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism along the way and got prescribed a medication for that. But my primary care doctor said he doesn‚Äôt think what‚Äôs happening is due to hypothyroidism because it‚Äôs been happening in relatively consistent episodes. I have a few other questions and I‚Äôm just wondering because sometimes just googling things can be difficult to gain answers. 

Do you guys have a consistent schedule sort of with episodes? For example, I tend to have 1.5-2 weeks where I‚Äôm perfectly ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and then a depressive episode for 10 days (practically always 10 days), then can‚Äôt sleep and hyper for about four afterwards. The pattern seems to be pretty consistent too for the past few months and I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs common / consistent with bipolar.

During your depressive episodes do you guys experience disassociation / depersonalization / derealization? That‚Äôs mainly all of what mine tend to consist of and with a general feeling of sadness and feeling like I want to cry.

Are you guys easily suggestible during a depressive episode? One of my friends called one of my cats fat as a joke because they love to eat. Then the rest of the episode I thought my cat‚Äôs sides were bulging and she was gonna explode sort of. I was able to somewhat calm myself and tell myself it wasn‚Äôt true, but whenever I looked at her that‚Äôs what I saw. Until the episode ended and I realized she was perfectly healthy weight and her sides weren‚Äôt bulging at all and she wasn‚Äôt gonna explode. 

I couldn‚Äôt find the ‚Äúpending diagnosis‚Äù flair when I searched for it. Sorry, this is my first time making a post to Reddit!! I appreciate any answers from anyone that‚Äôs comfortable, no pressure in providing any at all!!",bipolar

"Is my psychiatrist a quack? My psychiatrist is notorious for thinking I‚Äôm fine and not in need of a medication change even when I‚Äôm describing manic/probably problematic behavior like buying a $400/month car when a beater would have done fine. Racking up $10K in credit card debt in less than a year. He asks about my sleep; I say I haven‚Äôt been sleeping as much, but mostly just because I am overwhelmed by parenting and want to have some quiet ‚Äúme‚Äù time at the end of the day. So, about 2 days a week I‚Äôll skip my sedating meds and stay up late or not sleep at all. He asks, ‚ÄúBut when you want to sleep, can you sleep?‚Äù I say yes, and he says, ‚ÄúOh yeah, you‚Äôre fine.‚Äù He explains that it‚Äôs really only a problem when you want to sleep but can‚Äôt because your mind won‚Äôt slow down. Makes sense I guess. I‚Äôm just surprised he‚Äôs not concerned by someone who is describing a decreased need for sleep.

I was surprised too because we‚Äôre always taught how important medication adherence is with this illness, yet my psychiatrist was seemingly unconcerned by me skipping doses here and there. If taking my mood stabilizing medications 71-86% of the time is good enough to maintain a stable mood ‚Äî and my experience proves this to be true, at least for me ‚Äî why was I freaking out about missing a lousy pill of Lamictal back in the day? 

This is the same guy who felt free to inform me that I am damaging my child by making her an only child. He asserted that subjecting your child to life as an only child is the worst thing you could possibly do for their development. I‚Äôve been seeing him for a long time though and I‚Äôm (mostly) stable so I guess we‚Äôre not doing too badly. It‚Äôs just interesting to me that I can think I have problematic behaviors yet run them by him and he‚Äôs like, nah, you‚Äôre good. It‚Äôs refreshing because sometimes I can get carried away with diagnosing myself.",bipolar
"Just got out of my first hospitalization I feel like I writing an old school Penthouse style letter to the editor ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this just happened to me‚Ä¶‚Äù 

I just got out of a 72 hour psych hold after heading to the ER (willingly). I was having probably the worst mixed episode to date and was spiraling for at least a month before it all sort of came to a head. I was going from hypomanic to depressed in fits of hours to days. This culminated in me storming a Taco Bell kitchen demanding they hurry up , to saying some pretty f‚Äôd up things to my spouse. Finally came to a head when I found myself playing chicken on the freeway closing my eyes off and on. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever imagined myself ever being that far gone. 

My spouse finally convinced me to seek immediate help by threatening to leave with the kids .. and even as I strolled into the ER I thought to myself how wrong she was. Fortunately when the nurses and doctor came to see me- I finally broke down. When the security guard showed up and I was told I‚Äôd be transferred to an inpatient center. 

Fortunately it was a very positive experience, if painful to get there. The center was definitely well run and patient centric. After giving me some Adavan and crashing for a day- I was able to participate in groups and therapies for the next couple of days. The psychiatrist also updated my meds, adding new ones to the mix that I‚Äôm optimistic for.

I‚Äôd like to think and hope this will be my last time, but I also find comfort that despite some of the horror stories, there are great places for me to find hello when it gets dark. I count myself lucky.",bipolar

"Had my first paranoia, happened after a nightmare The whole story is long so I won't get into detail, I'll give a bit of context and get to my question.

So a few days ago was the first time I experienced paranoia and hallucination. Even though I'm not in that state anymore, I'm still feeling the aftermath: anxiety, derealization, mood stuff basically. The episode lasted around 10 hours and involved the police and an emergency pass in the hospital, but in the end they didn't hospitalize me because I didn't have insurance (!) so I have to deal with the emotional dysregulation by myself now. Here's what I need to know:


Is there something I can do to kind of forget and cope with those scary things that happened? My therapist suggested art but when I tried to paint what I was seeing I was so scared to even look at them on paper again.

"Considering Genetic Risks and Parenthood with Bipolar Disorder? I‚Äôm almost 38, and after 18 months of trying to conceive‚Äîwith one ectopic pregnancy and an unsuccessful IVF round‚ÄîI‚Äôm doing some serious reflection. My doctors tell me I could still conceive naturally if I keep trying, which I believe is possible. But I'm pausing to really think about what‚Äôs best, especially with my family history of mental health.

Mental health issues are strong in my family. My mom has bipolar schizoaffective disorder, my dad has narcissistic traits, ADHD, and ASD. Growing up with two alcoholic, mentally ill parents meant any genetic predispositions my siblings and I had were bound to be triggered. As for me, I live with bipolar disorder, ADHD, and PMDD, and my siblings struggle with ADHD, ASD, OCD, anxiety, and depression.

I'm in a happy, healthy relationship, living in a different country, financially stable, with a life that feels...almost idyllic. And yet, the thought of passing on a genetic predisposition to mental health disorders haunts me.

So, I‚Äôm genuinely curious:

* Did you inherit bipolar disorder or other mental health conditions?
* Have you had children who inherited similar challenges?
* How has your family navigated the ups and downs if you‚Äôre parenting with a mental health history?
* Is there a reliable genetic test for bipolar disorder?

Nobody seems to get me‚Äîespecially my mom, who I unfortunately have to live with for a long time. She‚Äôs ill, possibly with bipolar disorder and other illnesses, and, sadly, she‚Äôs made me a mess. Maybe even messier and angrier than she is. Yet she still doesn‚Äôt understand me.

I have a loving boyfriend who tells me I'm the most wonderful woman he's ever met, that I‚Äôm beautiful and kind, and that he‚Äôs never known someone as pure as me. But I don‚Äôt see that. He doesn‚Äôt see the real monster I feel I am‚Äîthe ugly, flawed person I see in the mirror, the face I can barely stand to look at. I hardly ever take pictures of myself; I avoid mirrors as much as I can.

We might get married one day, but even then, I feel haunted by the fact that I never met my father. He‚Äôs even more of a mess than I am. Who would walk me down the aisle? I don‚Äôt have an uncle. I can‚Äôt even face my best friend and tell her I‚Äôm not who she thinks I am.

I feel like a failure, like I‚Äôll never be ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I rely on medication to stabilize my mood, and I may have to take it my whole life. My therapist doesn‚Äôt seem to care about how I feel‚Äîshe‚Äôs only concerned with my mom‚Äôs wellbeing, never mine.

Am I not important? Not to my dad? Not to my mom? To anyone, really?

I don‚Äôt even know what I love, or what my favorite color or dish is. I don‚Äôt know who I am or what I want to do. I feel empty, unable to put words to anything. I can‚Äôt even cry.

Sometimes, I don‚Äôt even feel like my diagnosis is accurate. I feel messier than just ‚Äúbipolar‚Äù‚Äîlike I have an illness no one‚Äôs ever identified. It‚Äôs like I have maggots crawling inside me, eating me from the inside out, and all I want to do is tear my skin open to get them out.

But I can‚Äôt self-harm, because if my mom found out, she‚Äôd just call me crazy, a failure. And with her heart condition, it could even be dangerous for her to see me that way.

I‚Äôm scared of death, too. I don‚Äôt believe in any religion, so I have no idea what comes after. What if I‚Äôm already dead?

Am I just bipolar ? Or maybe I also have BDP? Maybe affective schizophrenia? 
How am I supposed to know that even my therapist doesn‚Äôt listen to me !!!  ",bipolar

"Has Anyone Else Sandbagged Their Own Life? When I was in highschool I didn't really care about going to university. I had one place in mind and I didn't even try very hard for the application, even though I thought I really wanted it. When I didn't get in I sunk into a deep depression, sometime before or after I found out I was missing a credit and wouldn't graduate with the rest of my class. There was some shock and then later terror and more depression, but never resolve to change it. Never foresight to see that coming. No attempt to try multiple different programs.

I also somewhat understand my actions now as someone who was passively suicidal. I didn't just not care about my future, I had almost no plan and when that didn't take I wanted to crawl under my bed and die. For years leading up it was like I had no future. I struggled in school like many others but I had skills. I wanted to be a filmmaker. For reason it always felt, especially now in hindsight, more of a fantasy than a reality I could live out.

Over and over again I tried to restart my life but I would just abandon my plans. I never had to be afraid of going homeless, but suddenly now, years later, I'm afraid of so much more. I'm buried on guilt and shame, and fear that I'll be alone forever, or on the street, or insane. 

Where was that fear before?

Is that all that motivates people?

I was convinced people hsd genuine hopes and dreams...and maybe I was just broken down way before I had a chance... I don't know how to talk about it, or relate to anyone around me. I felt more in good company at the psych ward. I relate more to addicts and the homeless but you'd never know it looking at me or the life I've lived. People probably think I'm just a big loser or a weakling. The few who've heard my story know how deeply wounded I am. 

Maybe that's all I have left?

My story y'know?

And the days I am most scared is when I tell myself that it's no longer good enough to tell it, but I fight that. ",bipolar
"Is there anything ""positive"" about being bipolar to you? Trying to think positively, but the only good thing I can think of is that it's made me smarter in terms of empathy and understanding.

"Bipolar Dating Tips Needed There is this guy I work with who I have been spending a lot of time with. 
(I am a 21 yr old woman and he is a 28 yr old man)
We both like each other and are both aware, but I am in no position to date.

My most recent relationship (nov/23 - jun/24) ended poorly. It was also my first real relationship. I broke it off because I relized I could not meet his needs and only felt guilt and shame when I was around him because I had an extremely low self esteem. When we started dating, he got his shit together and I wasted my time. In addition to that, I would go long periods being distant with him, then try to make up for it with acts of kindness or treats.
Love bombing became a major and horrible habit for me.
None of it was intentional and I truly cared for him, but I felt so much relief after I broke up with him.

During that 7 month relationship, I was undiagnosed with what I now know is Bipolar Disorder, which seemed to line up with the love bombing.

Looking back, I still did care for him, but not once when I said I love you did I mean it the way he did, and I relize now I still can't tell the difference between strong platonic love for someone, and attraction.

Now someone is interested in me.
I really like him, I really like spending time with him, and I don't feel ashamed if myself with him, but I can't do that again.
When he confessed the way he felt, I told him I felt the same way, because I do, but I fear I'm doing the same thing again. 

I never dated in high-school and have no desire for anything besides close platonic physical contact with anyone I have ever known. 

I'm medicated now, but extremely irregulated and emotionally volatile.
I'm terrified that if he sees me as more than a friend, he'll see the kind of neglectful asshole I am because I'm too absorbed in my own problems to care for another person.

I want to be normal, I want to have normal reactions and thoughts and feelings. I want to be able to go on normal dates and be normal around friends. I don't want to feel like I am a different person every single day so I can have stable relations with others.

Desperately looking for some advice from others who may have gone through something similar.",bipolar
"I think im manic for the first time in a long time and I don't know what to do I drank and smoked weed last night for the first time in a few months and I ran into somebody that I've flirted with in the past and I ended up making some decisions that I'm really not happy with and I'm frankly embaressed with myself and everybody at the bar who witnessed it.

"My sister passed away.. I lost my sister to suicide in May, she had bi polar as well. I fell pretty badly into addiction to cope with her passing. I stopped taking my medication these last 3 months, and I haven‚Äôt bought anymore substance. I‚Äôve been sober for about 2 weeks now and I have been having the most vivid dreams of her.

I had a fairly good therapist right before everything happened. Then she got sick and I kept getting passed around in that network. I‚Äôve burnt through a years worth of FMLA these past few months. 

She was only 27. She displayed every textbook sign of being suicidal. I feel like I abandoned her at her lowest. I did. I live with that guilt every waking hour. When I see her in my dreams i don‚Äôt even have the capacity to apologize to her there.

"Depressive episode or mood swings? I got fired from my job because i wasnt as bubbly as i came out to be, even though it had nothing to do with my work ethic they said. I was only there for 2 weeks, i think i was bubbly cuz of me being unstable and switching moods. I am seperating from my husband after a manic episode that caused me to cheat because I couldn't control my urges. It's still is not an excuse. I can't stop feeling aggressive and I can't get out of bed. I can't work on reconciliation with my husband because I have no mental energy to even take care of myself. My husband is aware of this and understands why I'm struggling. 
I wonder if my mood swings are back and I need to increase my medication again, I keep isolating and getting angry at loved ones for no reason. Idk what phase I'm currently in or if its another depressive episode. My family says I have to put my mental health first if I want to save my marriage, or get a job and save to move out, because currently I have no where to stay except with my husband. Tomorrow I start intensive outpatient treatment 4 times a week about 20 hours a week for the next 4 weeks. At least I'll be able to get out of bed and look forward to this. ",bipolar
"I fcked up After various therapists tried to convince me that I simply have ADHD, I found out a few days ago from my neurologist that I have schizoaffective disorder. Even though the diagnosis has finally shed light on the darkness, I feel like I've already destroyed my life.

I am M22 and graduated a few weeks ago with a bachelor's degree in engineering and am one of the best students. The problem: 3 months ago I went clubbing with a friend of mine and 2 women and everything was fine. Since I don't drink alcohol and don't take any other drugs, I can remember everything and knew that the evening was relaxed so far. When I got home and was lying in bed, I started derealizing, which I didn't notice at the time. I sent a voice message to 3 of my friends saying things like ""I just grab her ass and she doesn't want it... whore... what the fuck"". I don't mention any names in it either, my friends thought it was funny at first and thought I was taking the piss. I listened to it again a few weeks later and asked my friends to delete the voicemail, which they did. My Friends confirmed that I did Not harass anybody that evening and everything is Fine. I'm still incredibly scared that it will be leaked somewhere and I'll be accused of rape/sexual harassment and my career will be ruined. I'm completely desperate. This feeling of completely losing control about my conciousness without taking any drugs/alcohol drives me Crazy.

I really want to try another medication again but I know that will inevitably mean more frequent sessions for monitoring. I always fear that having the new medication won‚Äôt be worth it because then I might have to try a new one, or then what if I fall behind on being able to pay for survival expenses?

 I luckily have a therapist and psychiatrist who have helped me and can but it still feel kind of alone. 

The only person I know of who had bipolar was my former partner and she would say I should go get evaluated because it sounded similar tho she had bp1.

I always suspected I had it but just the fear of being told I did or facing the fact that's it's not something I can fix on my own was what stopped me. Also the constant change of medication she had to go through and how it affected her always scared me because depending on what she took would affect her very strongly. 

In summary I don't really know how to move foward or what the best option or what it's going to look like because I don't know anyone anymore who's been through it.

"Child is scared of me I (35f) was diagnosed in 2020. Prior to that I had a lot of struggles. Especially with parenting. The reason I sought a diagnosis was because I was terrified of hurting my kids (9m and 10f). It‚Äôs been over seven years since I even spanked either one, because I was afraid id snap and hurt them. Ever since then, it‚Äôs been a loss of electronics, grounding, extra chores, or going to my moms for the weekend (she‚Äôs a churchgoer and doesn‚Äôt believe in kids having tech). 

Their dad and I have been divorced for nine years. So this is all they‚Äôve known. We coparent very well. Myself, my ex, and my husband are referred to as the Tribunal of Parentood when it comes to any decision about the kids. It‚Äôs worked well this whole time.

I‚Äôve been having issues with my daughter though. My daughter has always been a daddy‚Äôs girl. Whenever we give the kids the choice to go by their dad, she jumps on it. 

Last night I sent her dad pictures of her room, as we have before to communicate about how they are doing with chores and taking care of their things. I asked him to speak with her about it before they got back, as I was really upset. I found my shoes, clothes, makeup, and office supplies from my home office, all over the place, along with food and drinks, garbage, and broken objects strewn about. It‚Äôs unlivable. As far as my belongings go, she‚Äôs never asked, she just goes in my rooms and takes what she wants. She destroyed my foundation, concealer. New sponges ripped apart, bent and cleaned out both of my mascaras. If she asks me, I let her, but I go get it back. 

When she got back last night, her dad said she didn‚Äôt want to come home. She sat in her room crying that she couldn‚Äôt breathe and hyperventilating. I sat with her to calm her and guide her out of the attack. She kept saying she‚Äôs so sorry and she‚Äôs so scared. I asked of what. She said she‚Äôs scared of me. I don‚Äôt yell anymore, I try talking and having discussions. So I don‚Äôt know where this is coming from.

I‚Äôve never managed to build self-discipline because everything has always been either way too much or nothing at all.

But you know, at least knowing all this now gives me a sense of direction, and I want to put it to use. I‚Äôm here for any tips, tricks, or general wisdom on how to manage my mental health, actually get things done, and hopefully feel a bit more like a person I can be proud of.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and to anyone who shares advice, I appreciate you more than you know <3

"Manic habits with no Mania? Does this happen to anyone else? I have spent thousands of dollars online shopping in the past month. I'm a grad student and know I do not have this money to spend. I also started looking into starting another business. Which is always a sure sign of hypomania for me. Business idea + money for start up materials +ego of thinking I can make this amazing business = hypomania for me.  

I also have been skin picking really bad on my scalp and am really struggling to stop. I've covered up mirrors try to wear headbands and everything and I am still not able to stop picking until I bleed (note it's not self injury it's more like a hyperfixation that I want to stop but can't for some reason) 

But I don't have the euphoric feelings or staying up late or motivation to do things.im also not super horny and doing sexually risky things (another sign for me). 

 I'm not sure if this happens to other people. What is it? What does it mean? And any tips for stopping the impulsive behavior.

"Very nervous this morning I haven‚Äôt driven very much in the last 2-3 years, since my first manic psychosis episode. The last 2 weekends I took our new to us jeep on the interstate with my husband in the passenger seat. The first time I made it about 20 miles before I pulled off at a rest area to swap with him because my hands were shaking so bad and my heart was racing. This past weekend I managed to make it a lot further on both days, but my hands still shook badly. I offered to drive about 30-45 minutes south of us to get meat from the butcher shop we use. Alone‚Ä¶. I plan to take the interstate but if it‚Äôs too much for me there are backroads I can use that I‚Äôm pretty familiar with, but I won‚Äôt have that safety net of my husband. 

I just had to take a shower alone. That‚Äôs stressful for me. I have PTSD as well as Bipolar 1 and being vulnerable in the shower is scary for me, but I did it. But now it‚Äôs made my nerves very frayed for the driving I have to do in an hour. My husband did take the jeep to work so that I could use the Camry which has more safety features and is easier to drive and has way more power to get up to speed when getting on the interstate. So we have mitigated my fears as best we can.

Anyway I just wanted to get this off my chest. My family and friends do not understand what a big deal this is for me, or just how bad my anxiety is. Even my own 29 year old son who just was home in June to help out with a severe episode that had me hospitalized, replied when I told him about my first time driving in years, he says gee mom it‚Äôs almost like you drove for years. Ouch. I was so excited and proud of myself. At least my husband is supportive, he knows how badly I‚Äôm struggling just to return to some semblance of normal.

"i feel bad and is it my fault? ive been burned out for almost a month  I 21m I've been working on our college capstone project for nearly two months. As a software development student, I've been almost sleep-deprived while developing our web-based system. Our group of four, unfortunately, has been unbalanced. While I've been solely responsible for the system's development, my three teammates have been assigned the relatively easier task of documentation.

Feeling immense pressure to meet the project defense deadline, I completed nearly 80% of the system on my own. Exhausted and overwhelmed, I decided to step back and let them take charge. I assigned them the remaining tasks, hoping they would step up. However, they ended up hiring someone else to finish the system, which still isn't complete.

Now, they're asking me to finish the project, and I'm struggling to find the motivation. I feel guilty for leaving them, but I was truly exhausted after two months of relentless work. I've tried to help with beta and alpha testing, but my energy levels are still low.

Recently, I scolded a groupmate for making a mistake, and I'm feeling guilty about that too. I worry that they're blaming me and talking negatively about me behind my back.

"Dropped out of school  In July I had a manic/paychotic episode. I was hospitalized for a month and recovered well. I was still hypomanic when I decided to register for a college program. Primary Care Paramedic training at a local college near me. I had thought about becoming a paramedic before and when I found the program it felt like it was right. I signed up pretty quickly and began school in October. I studied for a month and was doing very well. I was acing most of my anatomy and physiology tests and completing all homework on time, I also didn‚Äôt miss a day. 
I got the flu and missed two days of school and when I went back I had a quiz that I got 50% on. This triggered me to start thinking about dropping out. I convinced myself that the program wasn‚Äôt the right thing for me to do right now and I withdrew from my studies all in one day. 
Part of my decision is made because I am not sure being a paramedic would be a healthy career for me. I think the long shifts and stressful workload could potentially worsen my illness.
I also believe I could‚Äôve done great in the program and could have become an excellent paramedic. 
Now I‚Äôm falling into a bit of a slump because no longer do I have something that gets me up every morning and I feel confused about what I‚Äôm going to do with my life.

"How did you suspect you were bipolar? I‚Äôll start, I‚Äôve always been a bit of a difficult teenager but nothing out of the normal really just pretty reckless like sneaking out constantly, hanging out with people that I shouldn‚Äôt and smoking weed starting at 14. When I was 17 is when I started realizing something was not right up there. For a period of time I fully believed that there were secret cameras that were watching me at all times, in my room, in the bathroom and everywhere I went so I believed I had to act perfect because well I‚Äôm always being watched.

 I‚Äôm scared every decision is getting me closer to somewhere I don‚Äôt want to be. Every thought is over thought. Every choice is confusing. I‚Äôm nervous. Financial burdens are heavy. Would I feel a sense of comfort with 30k in the bank? Possibly. Is the anxiety building to prepare me for my next difficult action?     
  Will I accomplish any goal I wish to achieve? Does a higher power watch over me? I hope. I want to trust in something bigger, but I feel a devilish presence with each confusing step in a different direction. A donkey sees two barrels of bay in opposite directions and doesn‚Äôt question which one is closer. 

The moment a human is placed in between the two barrels. The human begins to question which barrel is closer. I can‚Äôt let the world see me weak. I am timid to admit my shortcomings. For the wrong person with the ideas of my truest self will have over me a wrecking ball which could be dropped at any moment. Powerful intrusive thoughts that I will never be good enough. I have fallen before and that is all I may do. Even the strength to lift 100s of pounds will never be enough. I must relax and calm my flowing mind of negative thoughts, for I am not weak, but careful in my judgement. I want to floss and brush, as to sleep beautifully. I pray my nightmares or dreams will improve. Is the past but a torment onto a weak mind? Help me remain calm and positive. Ever pursuing the goals, I wish to accomplish.

"How do you deal with the fallout after a manic episode? I‚Äôm home from my first grippy sock vacation after a bit of a whirlwind manic episode. This is the first time a lot of the people in my life have seen things at it‚Äôs worst, and it was a work colleague who took me from work to my doc (in complete embarrassment, he actually spoke with his psychiatrist mother about my behaviour and she gave him an action plan to keep everyone safe). Admission was intense, and my partner was called in to be there with me. Which.. well, it‚Äôs really changed everything in the relationship. She‚Äôs heard things I otherwise never would have shared simply because of just how dark or disturbing the dialogue is.

Now everyone at work knows what‚Äôs going on, my partner can‚Äôt see me in the same light, I have said and done a lot of things I can‚Äôt take back, all of this on top of an empty bank account and a damaged body courtesy of hitting substances far too hard. 

I‚Äôm so damn grateful that people care, but I am feeling the fall out. I‚Äôm already acutely aware of how much reality has shifted back into the real world, and that in itself is confronting enough. 

How have you managed this fallout in your experience? Should I go and apologise profusely to each and everyone? Do I just walk in and pretend that everything is fine and try not to bring it up? Should I regret my partner being more aware of what‚Äôs happening in my head? 

I‚Äôd be grateful for any lived experience from you fine folks, it feels like a lot. ",bipolar
Hypomania  I got diagnosed with bipolar 1 almost exactly one year ago and it‚Äôs been quite the journey. My meds has been stable for 2 months now. I woke up two days ago noticing I‚Äôm hypomanic. I thought I missed mania but I don‚Äôt. The feeling in my body felt so familiar and it reminded me of the times I‚Äôve gotten hospitalized. (It starts with this body feeling that my impulses then escalate and it sends me to the hospital). I feel like I‚Äôm isolating but I feel like it‚Äôs what I need. I asked for a few days space in my relationship and cancelled plans. I feel afraid to go out because I don‚Äôt want to ruin my life like I‚Äôve done in the past. It‚Äôs the 3rd day I‚Äôm in it and I just want it to go away. These feelings of grandiosity and harmful risky behaviors‚Ä¶ i hate it.  The mania feels more palpable than day one. I‚Äôm worried it might escalate I just want it to end. Even though I‚Äôm making myself eat and sleep which I don‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶ it just feels so weird that for the first time I‚Äôm noticing all of it and feels kind of scary.

"Stable temperatures/weather = less mood swings? Hi team!

Anyone else noticed they have less mood swings when living in a place where the weather is more stable throughout the year?

Context: I live in Argentina. In my city the temp amplitude during the whole year goes from about 1 degree celsius on the coldest days of winter to around 42 degrees on the hottest days of summer.

In 2018 I moved to Mexico and lived there for two and a half years. The annual temp amplitude in Mex goes from about 6 degrees celsius to around 27 degrees.

After I came back to Argentina, which was during the COVID19 lockdown, I noticed myself longing to go back because I remember my time in Mexico as a time in which I was generally more stable. Of course my mood would go up and down depending on what was happening in my life, but I remember I was a happier person in general.  
My low moods weren't as low and my high moods weren't as high. I was genuinely happy but I never felt it was due to mania, it never got dangerous. It was also much easier for me to take better care of myself: I showered more often, I worked out, I ate healthy food. Here in Argentina I can't really make myself do those things even if I'm currently on meds that are better for me than the ones I used to take when I was in Mexico.  
I used to have more energy, I did more things that made me happy everyday, I took better care of my dogs, I was way more productive and actually enjoyed my life beyond my 9-5. I went out with friends, I streamed games online almost every day, I went out shopping or to eat, I was a really active person.

I don't feel like the lockdown had anything to do with my lower mood, since after it was over I was still unable to go back to the happy person I was before, even considering I'm now in my home country which means I have more friends, I know the city, I'm close to my family, it's easier to make new friends, it's easier to find jobs, etc.

Of course being the BIG DEAL that it is living in a foreign country, there are many other factors that might have played into this, but I really think this temperature thing had a lot to do with it. 

Has anyone else noticed this also? Thanks!",bipolar

"Promises to myself Hello people, 

I saw here on the bipolar channel many posts about self-guilt, which I struggle with it too. About every little mistake, while everyone moved on and live their lives. (search on this channel: past mistake) 

And since I'm changing and taking more care of myself and become a better person, I feel like an imposter often and then I put myself down inside until I get depressed and go to hold habits. But then my inner self is telling me that isn't me anymore, so I'm moving like 2 steps foward and one step back and so on. 

I guess I suffer, because I didn't live my authentic self. 

So I'm making promises to myself today and won't delete this post, like I always do and will read it again, until I mastered it. Actually I will also write it down and hang it on in my bed room. I post it here for everyone, who needs to hear it for themself, too. 

I promise to myself to take care of myself. 
I promise to myself to let stories with open ends just open and move on. 
I promise to myself to allow myself to accept my past. 
I promise to myself to create the best out of me for me, my husband my family, who never gave up on me. 
I promise to myself to let me be proud of myself, even if that means to do the bare minimum on bad days. 
I promise to myself to not be too harsh on myself. (that's the hardest part lol) 

This is something no therapist and nobody can promise me. Only myself to myself.

"Why can‚Äôt we ‚Äúplead insanity‚Äù to financial debts incurred when manic? If mania can be used to excuse crimes, then why are we held accountable to the enormous financial damages we can incur when off our face manic? Can we plead insanity to overdue taxes and credit card debt? Can we just return all the ridiculous shit and say ‚Äúmy bad, I was manic‚Äù?

What other illnesses include periods that can literally put you thousands (or in my case 100k plus) in debt? How many other illnesses list overspending, poor judgement and bad business decisions as part of their symptoms?

My life, business and future has been very nearly destroyed by years of undiagnosed (and now exceedingly obvious) mania. I want to get angry but at who? Myself? The government??? Healthcare? My parents? 

It‚Äôs like a never ending shit storm and once you do get diagnosed all you can do is try to catch the shit in leaky buckets until the next manic episode (which continue to come in full force because it takes years to find the holy grail med combo).

I‚Äôve found out some pretty disturbing news in the past year and *I really don‚Äôt care*. I‚Äôm functioning well and my house is clean which is something I‚Äôve always struggled with. Our relationship is stronger than ever. Even my dog is more snuggly! 

He‚Äôs worried because I don‚Äôt really talk to my family anymore. My sister is busy with a new job. My niece and nephew are in the teen/young adult phase so grown folk don‚Äôt really exist. My parents have sunk deep into the American political world so I choose not to speak to them so I don‚Äôt get dragged in. They all sound like legitimate reasons to me. 

We did discover that I have another sibling though. It was eye opening but honestly not shocking. I know everyone kind of lost their minds and I was just‚Ä¶meh. I didn‚Äôt make the decision. It has nothing to do with me really. They want to meet me but why? There have been these kind of bombshells all year from spare siblings we didn‚Äôt know about to major medical diagnoses. Heart attack, mini stroke, to a cancer scare. I‚Äôm still waiting to hear about that last one. We find out this year if we‚Äôll be moving next year which will mean a total upheaval of our lives. A change of not just jobs but continents. 

**And. I. Don‚Äôt. Care.**

That can‚Äôt be healthy. But do I want anything to change? Do I want to lose my mind the way the rest of the family is? Do I want to fall into an existential crisis by questioning my parents almost 50 year marriage? Do I want to stay up worrying about how the rest of my family will take it if we lose that family member? 

Yes I know I‚Äôm probably more detached than I should be but what other choice is there? I don‚Äôt want to start screwing with my meds. It took too long to get me here. And is all that mental drama worth it when I really like my life as it is now? Yes I miss my highs. I miss my creativity and the fun I would have. But this way I don‚Äôt fall into those depressive episodes where I can‚Äôt get out of bed for months at a time. 

I don‚Äôt want to feel those things but I also don‚Äôt like scaring my husband.

"Dealing with guilt during episodes  Hello,

During my episodes I often feel a lot of guilt. Particularly when I‚Äôm in my lows. Today I had to go home early from work. I felt this physical as well as mental fatigue (I‚Äôm not sure if, you, also feel it in your body as well as mind). 

The night before I was feeling extremely emotional for no reason. When my partner got home from work I could not stop crying or explain why. I had been in a low for a while but not quite this openly emotional. Usually my lows are in my head, and I don‚Äôt have outbursts (at least not in front of others). 

Anyway, after leaving work I had this enormous amount of guilt. I felt upset with myself that I had to leave. I felt stupid and angry that this illness can impact my daily performance. My partner picked me up and took me home, but he had to go to work. I was literally clinging to him and crying. He had to go into work, which I understood, but I just felt this incredible deep sadness within. The rest of the day went so fast.. I had all these plans to self care, structure a routine for the rest of the week to help get me through.. but it‚Äôs like the day flashed before my eyes and I didn‚Äôt accomplish anything.

How do I not feel guilt for going home when I know I‚Äôve reached my limit? 

I also feel this guilt when I‚Äôm hypomanic. I‚Äôm a very avid runner and like to exercise, but when I‚Äôm in these mixed or rapid cycling states, I get very agitated. I‚Äôm always feeling the need to do something and I want to do it, but I cannot mentally push through to actually do it. Then, I start to feel angry at myself and even more irritated if I don‚Äôt go out for a run, or if the run isn‚Äôt as great as I expected or anything. I feel like I‚Äôve messed up everything and the world is going to come crashing down- or that I‚Äôm going to become this big slob and gain heaps of weight, or lose my fitness. And then it just kind of repeats

"Outbursts? Hey everyone. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with type 2 for several years now but have had the symptoms since I was very young. 

Lately I‚Äôve been in the worst financial stress of my life and it‚Äôs had me in a pretty constant crisis mode. I live alone and pay all my own bills and I‚Äôm not making it. Since my life hasn‚Äôt been going well, my symptoms have been much worse recently. I‚Äôm having episodes where I‚Äôm deeply uninterested in things and feel the weight of the world on my chest and I can get agitated and take things the wrong way and get really worked up going through a series of strong emotions. 

My partner and I had an important date night this last Sunday and I spent the whole day in a very low state. I was catatonic during the date and then went from crying to upset back and forth on the way home and the rest of the night. 

That said, have you been in similar serious life situations and noticed your episodes were worse or have you had outbursts where you took everything the wrong way and took it out on those around you? 

My partner had someone tell her this outburst I had sounded more like BPD but my whole family has bipolar and these type of outbursts under stress are something I‚Äôve experienced and seen first hand.

I‚Äôm freaked out at the thought of having a different illness and I‚Äôm partly hoping to hear that others can relate so I don‚Äôt have to worry about the wrong diagnosis but I‚Äôd also just like to hear others experiences and maybe learn some ways I can approach situations like this in the future.

Lately the past 8 months I‚Äôve been in and out of doctors appointments, I‚Äôm talking all sorts.

I finally did a few things for myself regarding relationships with other people and it has helped lift some weight I didn‚Äôt know I had. I always give away my happiness. I‚Äôve been by exes therapist for a few years after our splitting ways, we both genuinely cared about each other and kept in touch frequently. I just didn‚Äôt want to do it anymore, to me it is so frustrating to watch someone suffer when they don‚Äôt have to especially when I am doing it practically 24/7 and would do anything to get back to a different time. I told her how I felt about her abusive bf, how I felt about her( still have feelings) and how she was better than this situation and that she needs to start respecting herself if she wants to stay in touch. Not as a way of getting her back, but as a way of setting a boundary. Her and I are much alike in our perfectionism and unwillingness to let others settle for less. It‚Äôs a long story and maybe I‚Äôm the asshoke.. They‚Äôve not been together to long and I told her time is of the essence the longer she waits the harder it will be. The last thing she said to me right after we got off the phone was a text from her Mom saying not to call her back (we joked about me calling her back and pretending to be a different guy) I realized I don‚Äôt want to be on talk with limitations anymore. 

Anyways that‚Äôs the tip of the iceberg. I always tell myself it can get worse to spark a desire to live in the light, and it has consistently so I‚Äôm glad I had the right mindset. 

Ways I‚Äôve coped 
For anyone fortunate enough to have a support system they‚Äôre neglecting to use, I was in a similar position and broke the chains. Being manic helps that confidence is like no other.

When I stopped lying to myself and started listening it opened doors for my mental health.

"Life is nothing but a lie Around january 2023 I started feeling slowly but steadily down. By that time I had been sober (alcohol, used to be a train wreck) for a year and some, had gotten my shit together in uni and was actually doing a shit ton of courses per semester and passing them all with stunning grades. Was working a job that I really enjoyed and was somewhat related to my career. I had a shit ton of friends and felt so very loved by them all, I was filled with gratitude . By that point (january 2023) I'd also been in a relationship for like a year and although it was a very toxic one and he ended up being a vile man, to me being in a relationship felt almost surreal since I had never been in one before, not once in my life, and I am in my mid twenties. Over all, I was doing good. So good. So fucking good it felt a little bit like a dream. 

I thought sobriety was responsible for my achieving all of this stuff in only a bit over a year. Prior to all this, I was a living hell- a raging alcoholic, unable to work, useless at uni, with two attempts on my back and a long history of sh. It was a nightmare. I of course knew I was going through the longest depressive episode of my life, but after all of this improvement I was certain that things had magically gotten amazing the moment I stopped drinking and went 100% sober and that alcohol must've been the cause for all of the stuff that I had to go through before.

It had never occurred to me that there surely must've been a reason for me to finally stop drinking out of the blue, almost no effort at all, after so so many failed attempts. 

Turns out it was all just a manic episode. All of it. All of the good things, the extraordinary things, the stuff that people would've never believed I was capable of had they not been there as witnesses.

And then january. It all started with a sudden habit of overreacting towards minor issues. Feeling a little bit off. Kinda sad. You know, it happens to all us.
Next thing I know, in only a matter of weeks, I was on a mental health leave from work, unable to communicate, alienated at home all day long doing nothing but uncontrollably sobbing and feeling as if the world had ended for no fucking reason at all. Soon after that I started drinking again.

Then came november 2023. Got better. Again.

A new job, one that I am absolutely in love with. Broke up with the guy and realized how damaging the relationship actually was. Kept on going with my career, as good or better than before the downfall, and this last march even started a second one that I also excell at (academia is very important to me). Friends. Social outings every weekend. Flirty but cautious, just having fun. I could drink like any other human being out there and had no issues with self control.

And then, couple months ago, I felt it again. Almost down to a T.

It all repeated itself. All of it. I once again find myself on a mental health leave, barely managing with the few courses I didn't drop this semester and absolutely fucking hopeless. Last week I spent the entirety of my savings on alcohol and shit.

I am so tired.
It's all a lie. The life that one builds for oneself. Doesn't matter what you do, how good ir gets- they're all the city of Troy and will inevitable burn to the ground, it's only a matter of time.

I just wanted to rant for a bit. Tonight's being rough, although I gotta say I'm managing it way better than how I did back in 2023, let alone years before that. ",bipolar

"How do people with bipolar have kids? I (23F) was diagnosed with bipolar II after a lifetime of suffering with severe depression. I go through long and severe phases (as I‚Äôm sure many of you do) of depressive episodes, characterised by my lack of showering, brushing teeth, doing laundry, cleaning my room, leaving the house, eating, etc. However. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm reasonably committed to my own general improvement; I try to create routines, I do therapy once a week for years now, I‚Äôm medicated, I stay away from drugs and alcohol for the most part, and I generally try to do things that will serve me and help my mental health, whenever I can (whenever I‚Äôm not severely depressed). 
One day, though, I want to have kids (ideally at least 4, but we‚Äôll see when we get there). I‚Äôve thought about the fact that my kids are going to be at a higher risk for developing bipolar because of my diagnosis, but I always thought that if they ever did, I would be really good at supporting them and I think it‚Äôs obviously not worth not having kids at all (in my opinion). 
But my question is this: how on earth do people who struggle with bipolar the way I do (especially the depression) manage to keep their kids healthy and happy when they can‚Äôt always do that for themselves? How am I meant to feed my kids several times a day when I sometimes can‚Äôt even get out of bed? How do I keep the house running smoothly when I currently can‚Äôt even keep up with my own bedroom and laundry? It might be a stupid question, but I‚Äôm really interested in seeing what any of you bipolar parents (maybe mothers specifically, because I‚Äôm a woman) have to say about the struggles of being a bipolar parent. Like, the way my life is now, considering my capabilities and limitations, I don‚Äôt see how it would work that well for me.

Every small thing can completely ruin my entire mood during depression and it will stay like this for a longer time.

"my mind is reading more and more every day Ok, let's go (if there are any mistakes it's because it's being done on Google Translate), I'm 21 years old and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 5 years ago and with OCD 10 years ago, recently the OCD has been consuming me, and it's making me really bad (yes, I'm in therapy and seeing a psychiatrist), I'm extremely intelligent but because of the medication this ""genius"" just fades away, and if I don't take them I can think more ""clearly"" but either extremely agitated and anxious, or suicidal, but recently I've been having symptoms I've never had before, like hearing voices, disconnection from reality, blackouts, and a teacher died and I had forgotten that less than 6 months ago she had taught me a class and I had forgotten about her and her face even though she was a dear teacher, what else could I be forgetting? How do I know I won't just... go completely crazy? Tomorrow I have therapy but it's hard for a neurotypical to understand",bipolar
"Does anyone else crave intensity? So I was in some very emotionally intense relationships over the summer, and since then I‚Äôve taken a break from dating. I also stopped talking to two people in my family who kept putting me on an emotional roller coaster. Now it‚Äôs been several months without anything intense both romantic and platonic, and I‚Äôm craving it like a mother fker. I know the romantic relationships aren‚Äôt healthy when they are so intense, and I‚Äôve felt so at peace since not being on any emotional roller coasters with my fam. 

But just know I did what I call a crazy person thing I redownload bumble to try to find the super intense guy, since I was on a date with someone and it was just awkward so I texted the intense guy, then I tried to call him from the bathroom when his number had been disconnected. It‚Äôs total crazy person behavior I know, but I really miss the intensity with him, even though full stop he was full of red flags and it was a dumpster fire. My therapist says my childhood was so intense and my first relationship was so intense so that‚Äôs what my body is used to. But man I miss it so bad right now. ",bipolar

"Afraid to let go of relationship  Coming up on a year of divorce. Seeing a lot of posts on here about the difficulty of relationships and the life saving support some spouses have provided. I‚Äôm afraid of being alone now with no real support system. I‚Äôm not really close with any of my family and don‚Äôt really have any close friends. 

Been medicated and stable for several years, but the separation and past 18 months or so has been really difficult. I have a very stressful job that I‚Äôve been questioning for a while now whether I can continue to do. And being divorced has made getting by financially difficult. 

My ex continues to push me to get back together. And part of the appeal was her devotion to me. But she basically became a stalker when I found out about some things and filed for divorce. This is a throw away account and I‚Äôm trying not to get into the details because I don‚Äôt want her trying to manipulate me by responding to this. 

I know all the things she‚Äôs done especially since the divorce are major signs I shouldn‚Äôt go back. But I‚Äôm worried at some point I‚Äôm going to lose it either because of her continued harassment or other life stress. Not only will it ruin my life, but my kids as well. Without my child support and insurance, not to mention my efforts to ensure their well being I can‚Äôt imagine what would happen.

"No meds? No problem. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I've got bipolar type 1, and after years of trying different medications (everything from antidepressants to anti-psychotics), I believe I'm better off without them‚Äîat least, for me personally. None of the treatments worked, and every time I was on meds, I convinced myself I didn‚Äôt need them and they were messing with my brain. I quit cold turkey a year ago (DON‚ÄôT do this, it's dangerous) because my psychiatrist wouldn't help me taper off, and I was tired of feeling worse on meds.

I know I feel more intense highs and lows without them, but honestly, the meds made me feel worse overall. I‚Äôve been through over 5 different meds in 5 years and none of them helped. I tried keeping my life in balance‚Äîhealthy eating, regular exercise, and getting enough sleep‚Äîwhich worked better for me than any prescription but I struggle to keep the motivation to continue living healthy especially when I go through bad episodes.

That said, I still struggle, especially with impulsivity and mood swings. Last week I impulsively spent all my money and acted erratically, which worried my family and friends. Thankfully I didn‚Äôt fall into a super deep depressive episode after, but I‚Äôm still regretting all my decisions that week. Friends and family are supportive, but I need more tools to help manage this naturally. Does anyone have experience with supplements or practices that help stabilize mood or keep energy levels balanced without caffeine or any ‚Äúaddictive‚Äù or altering substances lol.

"Post bipolar I had a great life before my first episode. Finically sound, GF of 6 years, nice retirement saved up, great grades in an engineering degree. Great job lined up.

My girlfriend left me. And I was in psych ward for 50 days.

"Advice for someone with a late diagnosis Hi everyone, I (33F) have just been diagnosed with bipolar and I'm starting to see a lot of my life in a different light. I don't really have anyone to talk to who has gone through this, and would love some advice. 

I want to stop hurting the people around me with my erratic behavior and unpredictable emotions. I am already doing the following:

\- Therapy 

\- Eating healthy and correct number of calories

\- Exercising (gym several times a week)

\- On antidepressants

\- No alcohol because my reactions to it are increasingly unhinged

\- Sleeping early and getting enough sleep

I'm going through an extremely stressful time at the moment with family problems and a long distance move. I have a supportive husband and two friends I see regularly, but I am not being a good friend or partner. I think I am one meltdown away from loosing everyone and I always feel like I'm on the brink of a meltdown.

I would really appreciate some advice on how to stabilize my emotions. I feel very ashamed of my behavior and how much I've hurt people, which I know is unhelpful. I literally believe something one day, and the opposite the next day which looks like I'm constantly lying about my feelings. I thought all this instability came from my PTSD, depression and anxiety or maybe my being neuro divergent (ASD, dyslexia, dyspraxia) but I'm starting to think bipolar might be contributing significantly to the chaos that is my existence. 

How you deal with your emotions when they try to overwhelm you? Did going on medication for bipolar (like mood stabilizers) help?

"I cut off my best friend And I hate it. 

She struggles with her regulating her emotions, understanding and healthily displaying them. (for example, when she would get upset, she would throw things at people, scream, hit etc).

Then she would come to me in a panic. ‚ÄúHow could they ever forgive me, I‚Äôm a horrible person, They hate me.‚Äù She would assume I‚Äôm mad at her for any reason (like if I take too long to reply). I‚Äôd clarify that I‚Äôm not upset and she‚Äôd say ‚Äúso you don‚Äôt hate me???‚Äù We had a long talk about it and even after that, three different times I had to ask her to stop saying that because I felt like she was undermining the 4 years we were friends.

We had many talks. So many things give her anxiety. Example: she‚Äôd text me crying and panic over something at work, but was too scared to message her manager who fix the problem. She‚Äôd want my input, find a reason opposite of my opinion, then go to someone else (ex: mom) who would say the same thing as me, then come back to me and say ‚Äúmy mom said xyz so i‚Äôm okay now.‚Äù

She would start therapy and stop and start. She made a plan with her therapist (that I had no idea about until afterwards) that when upset, she‚Äôd come to me to calm down.

It felt like every day she was upset. And every time, she came to me. Which is fine, but I felt like my well wasn‚Äôt being replenished as quickly as I‚Äôd buckets of my water for her. She was more of a ‚Äúyes man‚Äù who would try to hype you up but never knew what to say or how to help. The moment that snapped in my mind was when I was crying upset and I was texting her. In the middle, she started talking about her favorite celebrity who had just posted. She did apologize and said her sister scolded her bc she does the same thing to her. 

I tried for a month to stop being so angry. I talked to her about the situation, I distanced myself for a while, I talked to others. I wanted to stop being so upset, but I realized that I‚Äôm upset because she isn‚Äôt able to give me the support I gave her. And that isn‚Äôt her fault. I want her to be somebody she isn‚Äôt. And she can‚Äôt be and it made me angry at her. I realized that it‚Äôs unfair of me to harbor this resentment, so today I told her how I‚Äôm proud of her and I hope she lands her dream job, but I think we‚Äôve grown apart and I wish her well.

I hate it. I miss her. 

I‚Äôm emotionally a mess, but every time I talk to her, I feel that I have to collect myself to help her (I‚Äôm 19F, she‚Äôs 25F). And for 4 years, I didn‚Äôt mind. But for some reason‚Ä¶ now I do.

I was thinking about this the other day. I start to spiral after 2-3 days of not sleeping. When I do make myself sleep with my sleep aid, I find that when I wake up I feel way better. In a nutshell, at least; I don‚Äôt feel like explaining it all in detail as I‚Äôm sure at least some of you understand what I‚Äôm trying to say here.

What if we all were just prescribed a sleep aid instead of antipsychotics or mood stabilizers? And if sleep is that powerful, do you think it‚Äôd help with depressive episodes?

"I finally got an experience on how bad hypersexuality can be Thank fucking god nothing bad happened but it genuinely felt so different from how I usually am. It almost didn't feel like it was me talking or acting looking back at it now, I'm just so shaken and kind of freaked out.

For context me and my girlfriend have started to be sexually active (this is our first time with anyone) it was mostly just foreplay but there were times when I could feel the hypomania spike and it genuinely felt like I was losing control of myself at the moment like all my inhibitors just got cut loose, fortunately I was conscious enough to pull a grip on myself.


I'm just genuinely so so so glad nothing bad happened. She found it enjoyable and she thinks I was just really eager but now that I'm a bit more conscious I fucking know that was not a case of just eagerness 


My current sleep schedule would most likely be to blame for this (I've had to pull multiple late nights due to school) and I'm definitely going back on my meds again for the time being. 

I know I'm not overreacting, genuinely, I know when I'm horny but this one was different I genuinely felt like I was losing a grip on myself and it scared me for a moment afterwards. I'm definitely still riding my hypomania, I'm fully expecting to crash out soon ",bipolar
"Embarrassed and Guilty About Getting Acedemic Accommodations I wasn't sure where else to post this, but I was on this subreddit about bipolar being a disability the other day, which I only just found out.
I am diagnosed with Bipolar 2, PTSD, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I have recently gone back to college after a 5 year gap of figuring my self out, healing, and getting my mental health under control.
Besides the overall culture shock of how different college is, it has been a huge trigger for me as well because of some trauma I dealt with the 1st go round of college. I'm also living back in my childhood hometown where a lot of abuse happened to me. It is affecting me a lot more than I thought. I'm going back into therapy and trying to cope/work on it, but honestly it's been so hard to function day to day. I'm constantly exhausted (even in my manic episodes, which I have terrible insomnia during which perpetuates the exhaustion cycle), been crying non stop, a panic attack once or twice a day when I try to leave the house.
I realize that my mental health situation is teetering on the edge of being really bad again if I don't do something about it, especially because my grades are also suffering. I think academic accommodations would help significantly, at least short term, but I feel guilty about it. I find myself down playing my situation/bipolar episodes and thinking about people with ""real"" disabilities. I would never think this about a peer with bipolar getting academic accommodations, so why am I thinking this about myself?

"Voluntary admission (+rant) What‚Äôs y‚Äôall‚Äôs experiences with voluntary admission?? I‚Äôve only been admitted once and it was because I made an attempt the day prior and went to the er the next day because I was vomiting blood. I ended up being admitted to three different units in 2 days. I was then admitted to my final hospital for a week and a half, then had to do a 3 month long IOP following.

I‚Äôve been having a really rough couple of months and winter is always the hardest. I dont plan on admitting myself voluntarily until January (just so I can finish the fall semester and get the time off from work).

I‚Äôve already spoken to my psych about my rapid cycling, my acute hallucinations, my depressive episodes worsening, I asked for a meds change and because of my instability the last few months and not seeing her for so long she rightfully denied a meds change. I don‚Äôt see her for another 3 weeks, and I‚Äôm gonna ask her again. I had a moment of crisis after doing a drug I will not mention here on Saturday. Luckily, after some cold fresh air, a lot of crying, a cigarette from a kind stranger, and my partner talking me down and picking me up, I was functional again. But I realized I‚Äôve been slipping up a lot lately.

During mania I‚Äôve been going on weekend benders, doing drugs and drinking even though I shouldn‚Äôt, emailing coworkers and managers picking up shifts I‚Äôm so confident I can do and then immediately the depression hits. I‚Äôve been oversleeping and missing my afternoon classes, coming to work late, foggy brained and exhausted while on shift. Once again doing drugs and drinking even though I shouldn‚Äôt, but I‚Äôd rather feel what I feel inebriated than how I do sober. The back and forth is just killing me.

My moment of crisis also made me realize I surround myself with so many people. I have friends, I have people who care about me. But I feel like such a burden in those moments because it‚Äôs like everyone is going through their own things I don‚Äôt wanna push my shit on them too. Crying and freaking out in the middle of the night sitting in a park, scrolling through my contacts and feeling like I can‚Äôt talk to anyone is crazy. I was going back and forth on calling my mom but I didn‚Äôt want her to worry about me, she thinks I‚Äôm at my happiest right now and shit I should be! I‚Äôm engaged, I have 4 loving pets, I‚Äôm in school, I have a job, i have friends and I party and hangout with people and yet I‚Äôm a mess. A literal mess. 

I‚Äôve already spoken to my partner about it. He agrees I should go to the hospital, it‚Äôs just a matter of figuring out if going voluntarily will be worth it. I‚Äôve done a lot of research on the process, and the hospital I wanna go to has a number for voluntary admissions, I just would like to know what others experiences are doing it as someone with bipolar disorder.

"Got handcuffed and put on psych hold  So I had a minor surgery about 3 weeks ago that made it hard to sleep. Lack of sleep goes hand in hand with my manic or mixed episodes.
 
I slept on average 3h/night for 2 weeks, after the first week of very little sleep, I had a lot of signs of mania that I of course didn‚Äôt notice. It got progressively worse to the point where on Halloween I felt like a switch flipped. Everything got super creepy and terrifying around me. I felt like there were people or entities in my walls that were going to get me. I had the lucidity to know something was not right and that I needed help, but my body fully believed the paranoid thoughts. So my heart rate was going insane, total panic. 
I called 911 and they sent behavioral health over to my place, I had to ask 911 to reassure me they weren‚Äôt coming to execute me lol. It‚Äôs my first time in the US calling emergency services for mental health so I did not expect what came next. 

They told me I needed to go to hospital, but that the police had to bring me there, not them. Next thing I know, police handcuffs me and I go in the back of the police car, and stay in those handcuffs the whole journey to CPEP. Plus an additional 45 minutes waiting alone in the car, on the super creepy parking lot. What a great combo when you‚Äôre paranoid af lol. I lose my shit and yell for help bc I feel so threatened despite there being no danger. Police finally lets me out of the car and allows me to walk while my ¬´¬†room¬†¬ª was being prepped.

Well that room was a padded cell like in the movies, all grey with the awful super aggressive white light. After more waiting, I got the shot in the butt and only then was I released from the handcuffs.

The positive is that the shot got rid of the paranoia and the mania. I was able to be released the next day.

Those who know me just tell me to go to work, saying that it will help me feel better, but I‚Äôm not feeling that way.

I have borderline personality disorder, bipolar II, chronic anxiety, and depression. Most of my days are spent at home and have been for almost a year. I worked one job, but I quit after two weeks. Then I had another job, and they let me go after two weeks, and I don‚Äôt even know why. This last one took my depression and suicidal thoughts to an extreme level, as I still don‚Äôt understand, even nearly two months later, what I did wrong.

I started looking for a job, but my mental health kept getting worse. However, in the society we live in, it‚Äôs unacceptable for someone to simply turn down a job just because they don‚Äôt feel right about it. I‚Äôm an adult, so I should just be happy, right?

The problem is, I‚Äôm not happy. I don‚Äôt want to get out of bed. Knowing that I‚Äôm supposed to start work on Tuesday has made my mental state worse ever since I found out a week ago. At first, I didn‚Äôt even want to tell anyone I‚Äôd been accepted because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I could go through with it. But I ended up sharing, and now everyone around me knows, so I can‚Äôt just not go.

Nobody understands why I feel this way or why, physically and emotionally, I simply don‚Äôt want to start this job. I‚Äôm not mentally okay, and everything about this job terrifies me. I genuinely don‚Äôt know what else to do. There‚Äôs only one day left, and all I do is cry because I just want to stay in my own space alone. I can‚Äôt bear the thought of being in a public-facing role again. The idea of new colleagues terrifies me, and other aspects of the job itself don‚Äôt appeal to me.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, so I decided to post here in the hope that someone who has been through something similar can help me. I know, on paper, I should be happy, but I feel even more miserable than before.

Every medication combo I've tried works for a little bit until it doesn't.

"Coming down from mania? I am so confused Hi everyone,

I just got diagnosed but it seems i had many manic episodes in my life before. I thought i just had mood swings, did not understand what was going on and why i felt so different about the same thing depending on the day... Last year I had an severe manic episode that lastet for month - started in spring and during the summer and it did not end until november and even then i still experienced mood swings. I had a lot of stress so I never really hat the chance to come down maybe. i think i was only better in february and march before i got hypomanic again...

this year i feel like everything startet all over again. again in the spring time.  i dumped my gf again although i know sometimes that i really love her, had random sex which i regret and i still feel like i am not really myself...i finally made the decision to see a psychiatrist and had a meeting with a therapist but all of this still feels strange to me. i feel like i have to distract me going on dates but i dump them after seeing them once...

i would like to ask you: how did the come down feel for you? my therapist told me that it can take month after the peak to come back fully to myself but i am feeling so confused. how did you know that you were back to your old self and how did you understand your emotiones? did old emotions just come back like that? i am not sure how to feel about certain things anymore. and the guilt...i am afraid of that. i think it will get worse. did you reach out to people to apologize? did that help? i dont know how to talk to my ex gf anymore as i put her trough so much pain but sometimes i really miss her and i think it was a mistake. how do i know if i am still manic? i feel like i will forget what i felt one moment during the next. i know it takes time and i havent started medication yet (but will soon) but i hope to get some answers. thank you!",bipolar

A friend called her, she unblocked me and the goddess appeared, I spent like it's the last day of my life. Champagne, blow, shisha, more blow. Unprotected sex with whoever. 

She kept wanting more and I couldn't stop. The sounds, her smell of vape and perfume, it was intoxicating. 

Then.... Clarity hit. Like a punch to the face. The hypomania was gone, the hypersexuality was gone, the girl was in my lap and I was DISGUSTED with myself.

I never thought I was a bad person but after last night, I don't know anymore. It wasn't money I couldn't afford losing and if I told a normal nightlife person about it they might actually be jealous.

But I know that I had no control, I know that I could've died from alcohol poisoning. I know that I didn't care about protection, I know.

I'm sitting here after taking my meds and I don't know how to continue living... I'm gonna get tested in a few days and I'm not going back to that place. I only drink when I'm outside and it's time to stop drinking.

I just needed to say this to someone... Thank you for reading.",bipolar

2.  How do you distinguish mania from just a bad decision? 

3. I‚Äôm trying therapy but I didn‚Äôt like my first (and only so far) therapist, how do I politely cancel my next appointment and try others?

4. Is this something I have to disclose to my job?

5. I feel ‚Äúcrazier‚Äù at night, does that mean my meds aren‚Äôt working?

6. How long do I have to test-run a med before I deem it ineffective?

7. Is this something I should disclose to potential partners in the talking stage? If so, how do I go about that?

8. How do I find support groups?

9. Does every med cause weight gain?

10. Is it easier to manage having friends who share the diagnosis with you?

11. How long do episodes typically last? Do I have to take work or school off during them?

12. How do I bounce back from the impulsive decisions I‚Äôve made while in mania?

 Because of my diagnosis I‚Äôm aware this is a manic episode but I genuinely don‚Äôt know who to talk to about my near constant violent and sexual thoughts. It‚Äôs very bad. I keep wanting to attack people. I keep wanting to fuck people. 

If I contact the supports they‚Äôll just put me in some kind of facility until I wind down. There‚Äôs a huge difference between someone who broadcasts that they want a fight to appear tough and the person who broadcasts they can‚Äôt stop wanting to fight and need help. 

Sex is meaningless, your respect or lack of it means nothing, I‚Äôm so overcharged in mania that all I want to do is fuck and fight and I don‚Äôt know who talk to about it. It‚Äôs out of control.

Was diagnosed late teens.  Took about a year and a hospital stay for me to accept it.  Been fairly stable since then, always took meds and have avoided triggers.

Turns out one trigger was hiding.

I like the ladies, but Ive always felt Id be the ball and chain.  So Ive avoided that part of life.

Then a week ago a wonderful girl came into town for one of my friend's family gatherings.  She looked at me and stole my soul!  We flirted a bit but I was trying to resist it like I had others before.

But I couldnt stop thinking about her (not lustful, just about how much i wanted to get to know her).  So later on I got her number and texted her.

She admited she was flirting with me and I was floating - little did i know straight into manic behavior.  I ignored that the next thing she said was she was sorry, but she had a partner, it was a mistake etc.

Nope straight to shes the only one and a constant torrent of overly emotional, over sharing, super inappropriate sexual texts.  This poor lady had this manic garbage thrown at her for 2 days before she finally had to beg me to stop.

Turns out (and i know through the grapevine this is true, unfortunatly) she suffers from anxiety - and boy was I helping.

I stopped texting, and she has probably (and i dont blame her!) blocked me.

When I came out of it (with plenty of deep depresion to go with love sickness (which is real I found out) I sent an explination/apology with no reply.  I didnt really expect one and Im not about to use friends which might make drama for her and we live in different states, however . .

I was so good and gentelmanly all my life, why did i break all of a sudden(the texts included quite alot of detailed discriptions and erm, pictures)?

If dealing with performance-impacting episodic illness where one only realises what happened once it's over, e.g. manic episodes, and one cannot retroactively take sick leave for the previous two weeks (this I imagine to be typical, but I didn't try hard to seek special case possibilities), it can be hard (impossible?) to have sickness taken into consideration in performance evaluations.

Under a system like that (which might be most systems?), someone with episodic illness that isn't easily self-recognised and reported probably needs some external support for said recognition and reporting.

"Can episodes vary greatly in length? Hey everyone!

First time poster here. Recently I have started therapy with my psychologist but they highly advised me to also see a psychiatrist because alongside of some other unrelated  bad stuff, a lot of the symptoms and things I go through remind them of some of their bipolar clients.

All my life I have always juggled between mania/hypomania-like state, depression/extreme depression and some brief periods of stability, but they would greatly vary in terms of length. Half a year I can be what could be described as manic/hypomanic, then it would either gradually turn to depression or suddenly switch to it.
Or it could be mania/hypo for a week, then depression for another week, then mania/hypo again and eventually the episodes would go longer again for no reason.
And again, sometimes there would be some periods of stability (just like rn) for a week or longer.

I already made a psychiatrist appointment for next week. I am just asking if anyone has ever experienced something like that and whether it's bipolar or not I still want to seek help. When I don't feel either manic/hypo or depressed, just this feeling of shame comes because of all the things I did or reacted in certain situations.

"I'm just a kiiid and life is a nightmare  

Title is a joke as I am unfortunately 23 years of age.

Hi so this is a burner, but I just needed to vent a little and maybe get some advice.

I live at home with my parents. I was diagnosed at 18 and before that I dropped out of my senior year bc of the symptoms I was encountering like a year before I went to a psychiatrist. After like four years of having a psych that in the end didn't even think I had bipolar (bc when I went to get another and my files were given to them, I was only listed as having depression/anxiety even though she explicitly diagnosed me with bipolar in 2020), I've been struggling to get my GED so I can actually, you know, be independent and live my life. I have a lot of shame surrounding it but I try and do my part with my family and be as grateful as I can for even having a place to stay at all.

The problem is that my dad is an alcoholic. He isn't physically abusive but he can be emotionally abusive and belligerent when drunk. I've been dealing with this since I was nine. He got a DUI in 2020 and ended up in a jail cell. Was sober for like nine months, then tried it again to see if he could take it.

Anyway, I've been biting my tongue lately even though he's recently lost his job and is stressed. But he gets drunk every night, per usual, and tonight he collapsed on the floor and I found my mother, who's currently experiencing a bad Crohn's flare up, trying to help him. I really couldn't do it anymore. I yanked him up and cursed him out, told him he was an asshole and ""fuck you."" 

I'm seeing my new psych next week and I hope to god that whatever medicine they give me works good so I can get a job by January at least and get myself out. I just wonder if anyone else has been in a similar situation/has advice? Because I've felt alone about it all these years, and it just makes me feel even more singled out as an already very mentally ill person. I had a very bad depressive episode the past month, couldn't even enjoy my birthday really, nor anything else in life, and I really just wish I could be normal.",bipolar

I just appreciate being alive so much. I‚Äôve had moments of sadness because I had a bad day or something bad happened, but I haven‚Äôt had a breakdown or struggled to get out of bed and I‚Äôve only cried once. I used to cry every. single. day.

I used to think about killing myself multiple times a day, too. I haven‚Äôt thought about that once. I can‚Äôt believe I ever wanted to end my own life.

I used to think my life was awful and needed major fixing. My life is the same it has always been technically, but I‚Äôm completely content with it now.

"Does it matter if I'm diagnosed with BP1 or BP2? After my first and only manic episode one year ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. However, after spending time in subreddits and other self-research, I'm really confused as to why I was given BP2 and not BP1. I experienced psychosis during and I was hospitalized for it. I was diagnosed when I got out of the hospital by my university psychiatrist, who basically wasn't there for any of it lol.

Now, I know official labels don't really mean that much, it's moreso if one's symptoms are being treated correctly. I've been taking daily antipsychotics since the hospital and have had only 1-2 very minor (hypo)manic feelings since, so I guess it's mostly been kept at bay. But would there be a benefit to being ""correctly"" diagnosed? I feel like keeping the bp2 label is going to reduce problems down the road (shoutout to ableism and stigma /s). But I also don't know if I'm screwing myself over by not getting reevaluated.

Would appreciate hearing from anyone, especially if you have personal experience with being misdiagnosed as the ""wrong"" bipolar type! Thanks :)

Maybe both. I need advice on forgiving myself because I've burned that bridge to a cinder and I can't even remember why I acted that way or what I was thinking. What I do remember sounds awful and I can't believe I acted the way I did. The things I was mad about don't bother me usually; not this bad. And some of them didn't even bother me at all, again, usually it's that way. I don't understand why I acted like that some of it didn't make sense.

I had a falling out with this friend of mine around 10 years ago from a similar episode. We stayed in contact but things were never able to reclaim that level of the friendship. We didn't really talk too much anymore but we stayed in contact and we're still friends and confidants.  We've know each other since we were 13. She was an Internet friend that I wanted to meet in person . We've talked on the phone and texted and emailed each other for over ten years now so it wasn't just a random obsession. We told each other EVERYTHING. About our trauma and troubles. We stayed up late just talking about life before I fucked up . It was a platonic friendship but she was one of my favorite people to talk to.

I got mad one day during an episode about how we don't talk that much anymore. I don't know why it made me so mad and I thought I was over with and delt with situation repeatedly and felt like I had moved on from it. I saw she was online and more or less harassed her to get her attention. She was ignoring my messages and told me I was act like a two year old once I went through desperate measures to get her attention by talking to her friends i don't know. I never act like that twords her she asked me why I was acting that way. And I'm not sure why other than feeling sad we don't really talk anymore. But I've never done something like that before. It's never made me that mad. I don't understand why I did it. That not who I am.

she cut me off and I told some of her secrets that she shared with me. I don't know why I reacted so hideously. I would NEVER do that in the right state of mind. But I did and she threatened to call the cops and blocked me. 

I feel so awful for how I acted. I have remorse. I hate myself. I don't think I can win her back. I think she will never speak to me ever again. She was a very good friend of mine and I had trust in her and I violated her trust. I really enjoyed talking to her. She helped me so much. One of the best friends I had ever made. But I'm still having intrusive thoughts that make me think about the situation. I feel like I can't let go and move on. I don't know what to do. I can't forgive myself.

"Is my existence as someone with bipolar disorder inherently be a burden? I feel like anyone who‚Äôs dealt with mental health issues, especially with one that‚Äôs known for its ‚Äúextremes‚Äù like Bipolar Disorder, often feel like a burden to those they love. If not often, then at least occasionally, especially when after coming down from an episode.

Those who you love, love you too, so they‚Äôll never call you a burden or atleast they won‚Äôt blatantly say it. But you can see the expression on their faces drop when they notice that you‚Äôre starting to do bad again. You can hear the sigh when they‚Äôve inexplicably, yet unintentionally, said something wrong that triggered you again. When they start asking ‚Äúhave you taken your meds?‚Äù Whenever you express a negative emotion. The look of concern and panic on their face when you try to vent‚Ä¶

Even if I stay silent, even if act like I‚Äôm fine, even if I go to some one else for support, or maybe even start journaling, just so I‚Äôm not burdening them with my existence, ultimately I know and so do they, that it‚Äôs only a matter of time until I have yet another episode. 

I‚Äôve never hurt anyone, or at least not that I know of and certainly not intentionally.

I don‚Äôt think I meant to be around people or be loved at all if all I am capable of being is a burden. I‚Äôm sure the only reason I‚Äôve yet to be abandoned by my loved ones is because of their fear that I‚Äôll off myself if they leave.",bipolar

"Two extremes of a psychosis 
So, I got diagnosed with bipolar 1 in the summer of 2023. I got my first full-blown manic episode that led to a psychosis. It was extreme. After that I started studying this disorder, cut off alcohol and started exercising regularly (almost religiously) and made sure I got enough sleep. I was very social, yet I was depressed during the winter and due to a very stressfull spring my anxiety increased. Then I just stopped. I got tired of fighting. I went almost catatonic. Nothing brought me joy anymore and I blamed myself for every inconvenience.  And this extreme depressive state led to a psychosis as well. Although it was like a negation of the first one, when my mood was very elevated. Now Hell got loose.

I went straight to work an internship after I got out of the psychiatric facility and now I am trying to finish my master's thesis. I'm almost done, but I feel so empty often when I am alone and I dissociate a lot and my cognitive abilities seem to have decreased due to these extreme circumstances. My doctor says that recovery takes time, but sometimes I just feel just kind of scared knowing what my brain is capable of. And what it's not. 

Has anyone else experienced a skitso-affective psychosis due to depressive state? I didn't think that could also happen. I was so afraid of mania reoccuring that I fell into another deep end although I tried to do everything right. Does this ring a bell?

For the last few days my goals have shifted from wanting to volunteer in Africa to giving away all of my money to others and destroying my life and chances at a future because why try for the impossible? Everything has felt impossible since god knows how long, so why try?

Lately I've been angry and mean on top of the emotional negativity, it's gone beyond ""nothing matters"" depression, and into ""fight me, I'm willing to lose everything I used to care about"". Sleep has been 6-8 hours a night for at least a few weeks now, getting harder to fall asleep on time. Feels like I have a moral obligation to give away everything I have to help a cause, cause I can't be helped.

Feeling very off, even more than usual. The strange thing is, I want to destroy my life, and there is no goal that this would accomplish. I just want to do it, stomp out any hope I have left. Don't plan on doing anything after, I just wanna watch myself crash and burn. Not very fidgety, at least not more than usual. Impulsivity off the charts, feeling very angry and willing to fight people which is the opposite of baseline.

What triggered it? it was building up for months. At least I'm not overwhelmed with emotions, instead I just feel like someone slipped something into my energy drinks.

Caffeine has less of an effect than normal. I can't focus on work anymore, money feels meaningless and life feels like a collective charade.

"Dealing with severe insomnia, please if possible! I‚Äôve had trouble sleeping since I was a little kid and as I got older my inability to sleep worsened. Once I got to high school I‚Äôd often go 24hrs (usually no more than 35 or so hours max.) without sleeping. If I wasn‚Äôt staying up for over 24hrs at a time then I was often only sleeping a few hours a night, waking up several times a night, or had a hard time falling asleep. 

It‚Äôs never really bothered me too much because I was able to function fine without experiencing any side effects of not having slept the previous night. I wasn‚Äôt lethargic, tired, or anything really. But now (in college) my insomnia has gotten far worse. I don‚Äôt even know how many days total in the past few weeks alone I haven‚Äôt slept. The longest I‚Äôve gone without sleeping, consecutively, this month was maybe around 60 or so hours?  And then on other days I‚Äôd go 24 to 30-ish hours without sleeping. 

I‚Äôve already talked to my psychiatrist about it and she and I both attributed the decline in my quality of sleep and ability to sleep in general to the loss of my antipsychotics + having mixed/(hypo)manic episode.

However, prior to my current episode, I was still dealing with insomnia, so my psychiatrist had prescribed me some medication to help me sleep. Due to the nature of the medication, I can only take it for a short period of time and it‚Äôs a controlled substance so I can‚Äôt just ask for another refill. Idk if I‚Äôd asked for another refill anyway because it honestly didn‚Äôt help too much, I‚Äôm not sure if the dosage was too low or what, but it simply just didn‚Äôt effect my ability to fall asleep (what it is supposed to do) very much, if at all. 

I‚Äôve tried pretty much all of the over the counter stuff and now, 3 different prescriptions. I just want to sleep. It‚Äôs gotten to a point where I am beginning to experience painful and uncomfortable side effects of sleep deprivation .

Even if I end up not having bipolar somehow, I've been noticing myself having what can only be described as mania/hypomania (agreed upon by a therapist who suggested being evaluated) and I am greatly struggling.

Usually I'm able to catch onto it right away as a low energy human, and it's never affected my life negatively besides maybe staying up too late, extra energy, spending money, or sending risky texts. To emphasize, I've *always* known it's happening, *while* it's happening

Well! Along with some other mental health related crisises that I've been experiencing, these manic/hypomanic episodes have been getting noticeabley worse. I've been making decisions that are very out of character and risky (not nearly as bad as they could be, but still very possibly dangerous) and just literally not noticing until someone else points it out or I have a small moment of being more rational.

I am usually an incredibly self aware and risk averse person. This is terrifying to me, not being able to tell if decisions are good or bad or having the capability to even find out! 

The worst part, is that even writing this, I can almost physically feel the pull to start doing these risky things, my brain is basically saying ""you feel amazing, you feel so energized and confident, how can this be bad? You're just finally on a good headspace, you're living life the way it's meant to be"".

Original post******

FYI definitely not manic. I've been fighting depression pretty hard, my psychiatrist dbld my meds and I'm on the ups. The issue is, I work 2nd shift and I just don't see a reason to get out of bed until 4 or 5pm. I don't have kids, I don't wanna clean. My partner isn't home to talk to, so I just stay in bed. I've lost all interest in things that bring me joy.

I do have an 8 year old dog. When I'm stable we go on lots of walks, but I have a run line in the back yard so he still gets plenty of exercise. I feel like if I had a puppy I'd have purpose, a reason to get out of bed.

But the reverse coin ""A baby won't solve your problems."" I am a good dog mom already and I feel like adding 1 more isn't that crazy. I've wanted another dog for a year and my friend has a litter of the kind of dog I was interested in already, so it's time sensitive for me to make a decision.

It feels like this could be really good for me, but I'm also super nervous. My friend said I can do a 1 week trial, so that's the plan. (But I think we all know how that ends.) I'm just so torn on what's the right decision. Any advice is welcome.",bipolar

Where darkness fills each corner of my soul.

Each compliment becomes another weight

We had an amazing time. Then she broke her arm ice skating and flew home herself bc she can't work. I found... a condom wrapper. Underneath our bed. Ripped and opened. Plain as day. Idk how I've not seen it. But she did a wierd deep clean of the whole house while I was gone and our bedroom. And she doesn't usually clean... our phone call was short. She admitted to cheating. And said she'd been wanting out for awhile. All of the effort and everything I did for us tossed out the window. Just like that.

"Do you get pareidolia from lack of sleep? Lately, I've been having very noticeable pareidolia and equally noticeable horrendous sleep. I heard voices from my cats' water fountain. It doesn't bother me anymore but I just thought it was interesting that it just sounds like normal water when my sleep is good.

Edit: I had a look at this article and it says there's no meaningful difference between bipolar participants and the control group (whereas you can differentiate schizophrenia from both). But it didn't look at sleep.

Edit: For anyone having shitty sleep at the moment and keep getting pareidolia. I find putting earphones and listening to audiobooks somewhat helps with getting to sleep and drowning out voices.

"Flirty flirt hypomaniac  Hi there. I've been on a hypo rollercoaster recently and got a sort of hyper fixation on two coworkers. The older one is  single and today I found out the other one is too. Now I have been getting a lot of attention from the younger one of them, and today this happens: We (a small group of coworkers ) were chatting about cleaning and he said something about his mother wanting to buy some cleaning supply for him ""now that I live alone"", and then he quickly looked at me and smiled like an insecure, vulnerable smile, and the others picked up on it and smiled, looking at me, and then back at him, like everyone knows he likes me. I've been getting vibes from him for a while now, so this confirmed it.
Now, the problem is that I've been hypo for the past weeks on and off, and I think I have been perceived as flirty. And I have been flirting, obviously. Now that my hypo is mostly gone I feel like crap about it. 
I am married, and he and the other guy has been fishing information about me, and my marital status, and not so subtly. I am so scared I'm gonna break this guy's heart. He's like 13 years younger than me and he's single now after a long relationship. He seems like a really really nice guy.

"I need my brain back!  Hey everyone, I‚Äôm bipolar and have been experiencing some pretty intense issues with focus, memory, and cognitive function. Initially, I thought these issues were part of a specific cycle, but I‚Äôve realized they stick around even when I‚Äôm in remission (euthymia). I‚Äôm actually off my meds right now, so I figured that might explain things, but I recently read that this can be a common experience for bipolar folks in euthymia.

For a bit of context, euthymia is usually seen as a stable period without the extreme mood swings typical of bipolar disorder. It‚Äôs meant to be a phase of calm without the highs and lows. But even during these times, studies have shown that a lot of us with bipolar still have cognitive deficits, especially around executive function and verbal memory.

It sounds like even in remission, cognitive impairment is a pretty big deal and might be tied to worse functional outcomes, especially as episodes add up over time.

"Well, I guess it‚Äôs finally time to seek help Later today I‚Äôm voluntarily admitting myself to a psych ward. I feel like it may have been something that needed to happen for a long time but I was too scared to admit it to everyone around me.

I‚Äôve always felt like I was intelligent enough to know when I wasn‚Äôt acting rationally, but I didn‚Äôt even realize that I had been on my longest manic streak of all time. Over the course of the last month and a half, I have proceeded to blow nearly half my savings, most of which went directly to going out to bars every single night and drinking copious amounts of alcohol. And when I say copious I mean that I would drink until I physically couldn‚Äôt anymore as long as I was having a good time. I was ready for anything and everything as long as I could squeeze a little more dopamine out of it. Only got like 4 hours of sleep a night, but was flying so high on cloud 9 that I couldn‚Äôt care less. 

Then I proceeded to do what I‚Äôve always considered to be the most evil thing you can do to someone you love, which was to cheat. This past weekend I cheated on my girlfriend of 4 years that I love more than anything 2 times in 2 nights after heading back out to bars to get hammered until the sun rose. This I don‚Äôt want sympathy for. I view it as inherently evil and honestly unforgivable.

Immediately after came the crash. When I got back in the morning I snapped back to reality and realized that I hadn‚Äôt been myself in a long time. So I sat down in my bathtub empty and emotionless and was finally going to ‚Äúdo it‚Äù. But then I stopped for just a moment and thought about my mom, and what it would do to her if I wasn‚Äôt there anymore.

So I finally came clean to everyone about everything. The over a decade of suicidal thoughts, the close calls, my actions over the past couple of months, and everything from the last few days. Told my family, told my girlfriend (who I wouldn‚Äôt blame for not forgiving me, I honestly do deserve it and don‚Äôt want to make any excuses for what I‚Äôve done). I‚Äôve been on medicine for it since around the time that I was 16, but it‚Äôs been a long time since it was tweaked (27 now), and I should‚Äôve known to go talk to a psych to adjust it, but I didn‚Äôt.

So I asked my family to drive me tomorrow to a bigger hospital than we have in our town in a nearby city where I‚Äôll have myself put in voluntarily to hopefully get some help getting everything under control again. Hopefully it‚Äôll work out.

Much love to all of you who suffer from this too, and if the post isn‚Äôt approved before I go in tomorrow, I hope to be able to talk to you all when I get out in hopefully a better place than I am now.",bipolar
"Bipolar on the NHS - advice I got diagnosed with bipolar type 1 by a psychiatrist when I was in private inpatient 2 years ago.
I can't afford private psychiatric care now so I'm at the mercy of the NHS for medication but I do have private therapy. I keep getting referred to the primary mental health team and then eventually they close my file and the cycle repeats. I've never been referred to the specialist mental health team even though I have a serious mental illness that qualifies me for an early Covid booster every year! I've had one ECG 6 months ago after being on anti psychotics for years which I had to ask for. 
In the past when I have gone to A&E in a mental health crisis or been down to my local mental health hospital for an in person assessment after calling 111 option 2 I don't get any help and usually just get sent home with a diazepam. 
I'm pretty articulate and can advocate for myself and turn up to appointments on time etc. That's my assumption as to why I don't get follow up care or get taken seriously. 
My current situation is that I got referred to the primary mental health team again 6 weeks ago. I stopped taking my bipolar meds 4 months ago during a 2 week addiction relapse caused by out of control mood swings and wanted to start fresh with new meds now I've been sober again for 4 months and have stopped punishing myself for relapsing by not going back on meds. I had an initial appointment with a pcn 4.5 weeks ago and haven't had a follow up because the pcn has apparently been off sick for over 2 weeks now.  No other pcn has picked up my case and the receptionist at my doctors I think essentially lied and told me they had no way of making an appointment for me with another pcn. So I asked for a gp appointment with the Dr that referred me to the mental health team this time instead which I'll have to wait until next Tuesday for because that gp is on holiday this week.

"Does the cycle ever stop?  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD during a tumultuous time in high school. I avoided treatment because I was terrified of taking pills, believing they were meant to hold me back. Things spiraled, and I ended up addicted to various substances. Throughout high school, I managed to hide my struggles behind a fa√ßade of being the quiet, responsible kid in class. The truth? I was using drugs during football games and even classes, only my closest friends knew.

After high school, I entered college and realized that if I wanted to succeed, I had to stop abusing substances. I worked hard to distance myself from toxic influences, even letting go of people I loved. For a while, I felt great‚ÄîI was eating healthy, sticking to a routine, and thriving. But then my ex came back into my life, triggering a severe depressive episode that sent me spiraling after I had undergone a period of abuse.

I sought help and started on a regimen of medications‚Äîeverything from antidepressants to mood stabilizers. I felt like a lab rat, taking up to eight pills a day. Instead of feeling alive, I felt numb, with only occasional spikes in emotion. Ultimately, the combination of meds led to a reckless driving incident that resulted in an arrest, leaving a mark on my record that I can‚Äôt expunge.

A year later, I tried to make the medications work, but they just didn't. My psychiatrist and nurse insisted I couldn‚Äôt stop, so I cut them off and even stopped taking my medications cold turkey. Now, I‚Äôve graduated college (barely) and found a job I love, but I still struggle with feelings of hopelessness and the relentless cycle of bipolar disorder.

"Is it smart to live close to home for college when you're bipolar? I have a question.

My biological dad wants me to stay close to home in case something bad happens with me. He's concerned about my bipolar disorder.

"Would you forgive her? The strangest thing happened to me! Before an important and stressful film project, my then girlfriend, who I loved very much at the time, started interrupting me repeatedly. She offered her help over and over even though I insisted (and later begged and begged) that I needed quiet to do last-minute, but essential work. She later admitted to 12 interruptions over 3 hours late at night: when I needed to do about an hour and a half of uninterrupted quiet work, it was more than enough to knock me off my equilibrium, but it was actually more interruptions than that. 



I slept less than an hour that night because of the interruptions and the drama (of begging, eventually shouting. she just wouldn't be quiet, for whatever reason!) it caused. I still don't understand it! I'm BP1. By the morning I was symptomatic. I later broke up with her -- partially because of symptoms and partially because of the ordeal she caused that night and what I went through during the day of filming on so little sleep. It was a day of severe sleep deprivation and high responsibility, not being able to perform certain things, physically and mentally painful to push through. Even later, with my symptoms getting worse, my doctor had me compose my now ex and her mom an email saying I needed a week to recover in our apartment, strongly recommended we stay apart, and be treated. I had no place else to go. Still, she came over, in spite of having multiple places where should could temporarily crash including a mansion in an adjacent state, to the apartment within less than 24 hours of the email. ""To get some blouses"" she later tells me.  

  
Later, I get worse, the drama continues, and she tried to get the police to remove me from the apartment. The paramedics checked me out and I seemed fine to them. Later, she locked me out of the apartment without notice and her mother tried to film me on her phone while I stand outside of our building. Eventually, I get even worse and I'm hospitalized and while I'm there she gets a Temporary Order of Protection against me because she was worried I would try to come back to the apartment and not leave, and it would be a pain to evict me because I had Occupant rights (she confessed those motives to a mutual friend. not what TOPs are for!). She lied in court that I chased her and her mother down the street. This never happened.

  
Recently, my ex has resurfaced saying she misses me and she's terribly lonely without me in her life and can we work towards a friendship. Part of me has been reconsidering the blame I put on her because I think I may have been slightly symptomatic for at least two weeks before that night she kept me up. My thinking is, ""How can I blame someone when I'm symptomatic. This is the illness's fault..."" Another part of me looks at her behaviors and wonders how they could have been worse? How could they possibly be worse?:

  
She caused a crisis not listening to my pleas for quiet and even if I was symptomatic, she still added fuel to the fire that night. Then directly went against my doctor's instructions. Then locked me out which was one of the biggest things that caused my downward spiral. Then she lies to get a TOP. It's a lot to digest. What do you think of all this? Could you forgive this person?

"Weather increased symptoms So I've been alot better the past two years, stressors have lifted alot and I live with two great people and two fur babies üò∫... 

Thing is the weather here sucks most of the time, my impulses for shopping have sky rocketed thus making me stressed about my economy.

I can't I have to take my meds, eventually clean up in my office/ wardrobe room and just not dive deeper into whatever this situation is. I've felt so many of the un medicated symptoms lately but they have increased without stressors and I feel it has something to do with the local weather cycles here.

Is it just me or is the weather more often than not affecting bipolar people ? I also notice it affects me both ways while on meds. But it might just be me that feels moody due to weather, especially the bad kind. I'm looking forward to the snow but cold windy rain is just not my kinda rain...

I have a nice life with little stress, the weather where I live is mostly rain and rapid changes in pressure.

"Is it smart to live closer to my dad for college? I'm bipolar type II and I am still passively (?) suicidal (much better than I was a couple months ago!). I have two options for schools: one is a bigger, better university with more scholarships and one is a smaller university, but is less expensive (as a baseline) and is closer to my dad, who would only be 45 minutes away and is my main support for my bipolar disorder.

He says in case anything bad happens to me he'd like to be close by, and in case I need anything he'd be right there. Mostly for things like in case I need medication, if I need rides to a therapist, etc., but with the bigger university I'd have the access to these on-campus and with a shuttle, anyways.


But I'm a little scared of myself I guess. I think I'll be okay and I know I'm supposed to be independent but is it different if you're bipolar? Can I ever be independent while bipolar? I don't know what to do. I want to go to the bigger university but I don't want to die in a depressive episode.

"I had the worst psych appointment today I went to the emergency room this morning and after seeing 2 nurses, a crisis worker, and a doctor, I was referred to a psychiatrist. I spent 5 hours waiting in that hospital room hoping to be able to see a psychiatrist and I was glad to hear that I was finally going to see one, but it was awful and I wasted 5 hours of my day.

I was there because I was having some very serious and terrible thoughts but all she proceeded to do was read the doctor's notes and not give me a chance to actually tell her how horrible I've been doing. She told me all I really needed was to see my therapist and do more therapy even though I've been seeing the same therapist fairly regularly for the past 9 years and that I am already doing group therapy. The worst of it was she didn't believe I have bipolar disorder. I was diagnosed 6 years ago and it was confirmed by 2 other doctors. My meds have stabilized me for years. After such a long wait to see someone all that came of it was being ignored and being given useless advice but at least she changed my meds a tiny bit.

I know that this disorder doesn't define me, but it has changed my life so much and forced me to find ways to survive and keep going. Having that experience disregarded simply because she read doctor's notes about why I was at the hospital and only having talked to me for 10 minutes made me feel unbelievably awful. I know my disorder and what it has done and she gave me one look and decided not to consider that.

She was there to help me in a time of crisis and she never asked me what my crisis was. Instead she ignored me and tried to diminish my history and present problems. It hurts but also makes me so infuriated.

"How I went viral during an episode  2 years ago at the height of the pandemic, in a manic episode that lasted 3 days, I created a fan page dedicated to Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Canadian Conservatives. I posted so many political memes non-stop that I garnered over 2.5k followers on Facebook in 2 days.

I was making fun of Trudeau and used a lot of catchy yet accusatory language because in my manic state I thought it was well-deserved and justified. I don't think like that anymore and no longer post on my page because I'm still embarrassed.

Unfortunately it seems the Conservatives beg to differ because a few months after I created that page where I dissed on Trudeau with every creative style conceivable to a bipolar person, the Conservatives started using a similar catchy yet anti-liberal accusatory style of communication in their social media posts and interactions. It's now gotten so bad, that people in parliament can barely keep a rational conversation as soon as the Conservatives start talking. It's also pretty bad that a lot of Pierre Poilievre's posts now resemble more of an Avenger's trailer than respectable content I can put confidence in.

"I don‚Äôt want to live like this‚Ä¶ tw: might be upsetting 


Soo Ive cried about this too many times, and its gotten so bad at times that im worried that one day I might actually do ‚Äúit‚Äù

Yesterday I told my psychiatrist just how bad this is getting, how im having ‚ÄúTHOSE thoughts‚Äù and they basically just said ‚Äúif its only a week long every month its better than being in the hospital‚Äù‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt have a plan or anything but I can absolutely see myself just reaching a breaking point and going for it.


But what i‚Äôm always crying about is how living life with bipolar just seems like a joke almost. Apparently mania and depression damages your brain, medication damages your brain. Hearing about people having memory loss and brain fog, people (including myself) losing touch with their personality. I will only ever laugh truly like once a month. The way my libido was shot down and hasn‚Äôt ever fully returned. Trying so many meds that all give me a number of side effects, and knowing that I will just have to deal with some of them for the rest of my life because its better than some others (it still makes me feel like shit a few nights a week, so horribly drowsy. And everynight I cant even breathe through my nose because its stuffed badly) basically suffering still, but I have to be happy about it because at least im not in the hospital!


My life was already a challenge before bipolar, ive been struggling with crippling social anxiety for my whole life, overthinking ANYTHING I say in public/to peers. So thats caused me to hide my true personality because im scared to death of being judged. (I was harassed and made fun of by classmates as a kid for this even though I would do nothing but simply mind my business) And now this is the cherry on top.

The sadness is mixed with an anger as well,
feeling angry and disgusted with my body because of how it cant even do the bare minimum (emotions, having a period every month, have a libido, etc) and I already have a low self esteem without that.


It‚Äôs not that I haven‚Äôt accepted being bipolar, I have, and I don‚Äôt mind the idea of taking medication (if it actually helped with my depression and didn‚Äôt give those side affects) Im just upset and devastated knowing that I will never be fully comfortable physically ever again or at peace. And by the looks of it I will never be able to truly enjoy living. its like being cursed.


And going back to medication side affects and trying new ones its only traumatized me more. I remember throwing up so much, one time to the point I couldn‚Äôt stop.

"Itching Under the Psych-Skin - I need to consult with you First time using Reddit so be gentle on me... also, sorry for the long post.

Short introduction - I am 23 years old, diagnosed with Bipolar for about 5 years now. Have had my depression, mixed episodes and hypomania. The last major episode was quite long ago, in the summer of 2021, and since then I have dealt with anxiety, the kind I usually get in a mixed episode, but something more ""subtle"" since I was already medicated. I am currently well medicated and have been balanced for the past few years.

But - in the past month I have had some changes in my life. My country is at war, I came back from abroad after two months, I finished my degree and I am hoping for a scholarship and then to start my M.A., so things are not  really stable.

On top of it - I have been feeling quite strange the past two weeks. The first description that popped into my mind was ""itching under the psych-skin."" You know the feeling, when it's itching under your skin? like, you feel this uneasy feeling, but it's not on the surface and you can't put your finger on it. So, it's something like that. I feel like I have grey feelings. I am not sad or depressed, but  I do find myself having a small void in my heart, like emptiness. Again, it's nothing dramatic, but it is strange.

In addition, I am moved really easily. One example would be me crying on the bus listening to a song I had already listened to a hundred times. Another example would be me feeling shattered after watching a TV show.

Another quite disturbing thing is me having anxiety one day. I was at my friend's house with my friends and got this major tummy ache. At first, I just winged it off with a tranquilliser, but the day afterwards I couldn't get up of the couch because of the ache until I finally puked and then took tranquilliser. Note - I know that this was anxiety and not some kind of a virus. I know myself well enough to differentiate between the two aches.

The last point is that my friend told me the other day that I was very loud and spoke fast. She has never seen me in mania/hypomania so for her to notice it without having any idea of what I look like in those scenarios is also disturbing me.

To sum up - these four points worry me and are not anything I really had before. I feel like these are signs that I am supposed to be in some kind of an episode - be it depression, hypomania or a mixed one, and that the fact that I am medicated prevents its full awakening. I will of course consult with my psychiatrist, but I am also writing here because I want to hear some of your experiences and thoughts. I have never really had a conversation with another bipolar person, so I wanna know - have you also had something alike? A glimpse of an episode nonetheless being medicated? Do you know this ""itching under the skin"" feeling as well? If you have and do, how was it solved? Did you change something in your meds, or did you just leave these glimpses alone and they passed away by themselves? I will say that I am happy with my current med situation. My meds have been stabilizing me for years, I sleep well at night and I'm functioning in my daily life. I am not sure if I really wanna change something, so if you can assure/disapprove my intuition of staying steady it'd be great.

Sorry again for the long post, and thank you in advance for your thoughts. <3",bipolar
"It's getting dark again.... So it's been seven months since my last round of medication
 (not on purpose I've just got life issues like lack of money, drive, and support system to get back on them) 
I've gone into maina 4 or 5 times since this but it's mostly been depressive. I am currently trying to get on meds however the doctor I'm trying to see Is taking their sweet time with everything. I'm angry, I'm angry all the time. I do grounding technics, I take a few mins and go to the garage (it's closed and sound proof) to scream or just get all my emotions out so I can go back to being depressed. I want to hurt things, I want to hurt people. I just can't tho. I was forced to grow up fast in a toxic house hold and this has made me a submissive person to the point that if it weren't for the angry out spurts they would walk all over me and my kindness. 
Lately It's been getting dark I'm seeing things 
That arnt there and hearing things louder than my own thoughts that arnt there. I'm scared. I know at this point I'm self aware enough that I need meds but can't put the engery into getting on them and staying on them. My support system is small but strong. (Litterly my husband and my 2 best friends) but that's it. When I have outbursts I get yelled at from everyone else that IM MAKING THEM UPSET and I shouldn't have outburst or be angry that i just need to keep my nose to the ground and just work and keep everything as normal as can be. I cant keep a job for the life of me. The longest job i had was a shit show and they worked me 7 days a week on busy months. Soo you know...toxic i finnally left that one and have another one lined up in novemeber. On the inside I'm dieing. I hate myself I hate it here. I hate the fact that I can't even regulate my own emotions enough sometimes that I can't even form sentences or talk to people. 
I am 2 seconds from ending a 20 year friendship with one of my friends because she said I don't reach out to her as often as I should. I've messaged this person for weeks on end after the last conversation about my isolation. I can't fucking do it all yet people make me responsible for it all. I'm tired. If it weren't for my husband I wouldn't have been here a year ago. I don't know what I can do untill I get on meds. I don't know what I should do. How I should act. It's all a fucking show at this point and I'm tired of being on stage. They won't let me relax i can't even lay in bed without someone crying about how the dishes arnt done or how dinner isnt cooks or how the house is a mess (grandparents are semi horders) somehow its all my fault. Why is it always my fault? I don't get it. ",bipolar

"Is it bad that my ex boyfriend is still one of my best friends? We broke up in March. He took it hard. In fact, our breakup was so bad for him that it sent him into a manic episode where he got diagnosed with BP1. We took a break from talking obviously and reconnected before Summer and everything was great between us as friendly exes.

Then I ghosted him and he called me a drug addict and psychotic and in a manic episode and batshit crazy‚Ä¶

But THEN I reached out to him apologizing for my part in our fallout a few months later and we called and he apologized too. 

Now we text almost everyday. I‚Äôve recently started experiencing hallucinations which he has been helping me navigate. Obviously I have a therapist and psychiatrist and meds, but relating to someone is a totally different type of comfort.

He‚Äôs very compassionate, always has been, but I feel like now we have this new, platonic connection because of our shared diagnosis. Not to say it‚Äôs allll we talk about, but it‚Äôs very helpful to have someone with similar experiences.

"There Is A Brighter Side  Last year, I cratered my life as I knew it thanks to bipolar. Fiance gone, friends gone, asked to move out of my home, unemployed. Things were looking pretty bleak.

But, things got better.

I got back on my meds, got a job that I'm doing well at. I milked every resource and research option I could. I reconnected with the person who had fallen into the crater of mania with me, and we made things work. Better than work.

And here I sit, a year later after one of the top 2 darkest moments of my life, next to my husband, in our new apartment. Expecting our first little girl within the next few weeks. Both healthy and well employed. We have an ongoing dialogue about our mental health, and how we're managing. I have a wonderful therapist who has graduated me to only having to talk to her monthly. I got my friends back after a lot of healing and dialogue.

It was so much work. The work never stops. It is a constant daily grind to make sure that level of psychosis never happens again.

But for the first time in a long, long time, I'm truly happy. We're planning for our futures in a way that last year felt impossible to achieve.

"Struggling after trauma Long story short, I was date rape drugged a couple of nights ago in a bar by a man. The experience itself was horrific, the aftermath was horrific, the treatment I received in hospital was horrific and now I am struggling badly. I feel like it's triggered a depressive episode as well as a bit of ptsd, as I have been having severe issues with my sleep, very vivid nightmares and waking up forgetting where I am at night (common symptoms I get before a manic episode). 

I have also been crying all the time, suffering from feelings of loneliness and severe paranoia and I just don't know what to do. I am about 2 months into starting treatment on lamictal and I just feel so heartbroken that this has happened because I was on such a good track. 

I also feel like I potentially ruined what could have been the start of a really good relationship with a really cool person because of this event, unfortunately they had to see me in this state and I was so out of my mind that I confessed about having bipolar and since then things have gone really quiet and I am just so embarrassed. 

There is so much in my head, I keep thinking how if something worse had happened to me and I hadn't escaped from this person, everyone would have just assumed I had done it intentionally due to my bipolar or looked at my past and blamed me.

The other one is more serious : when I was depressed or not able to react to events, I started giving up on sharing my opinion and trying to give pieces of advice/ideas because I knew I couldn't at all apply it to myself so it was not realistic, people would have said (in my imagination) who is speaking?

Since being on meds for over 2 weeks now, it helped so much with me not dwelling on situations, specifically negative situations. Recently, I noticed the negative thoughts have started flooding back from over a year ago and I got really upset about them yesterday and couldn't stop crying for the longest time. Last night, my ex and I were talking and I was talking about how I get lost at the park alone but I always find my way with GPS.

She said I was infantilizing her and I said that neither of us could make it on our own. She said I'll find another person to live off of. I was so broken and was considering going to a homeless shelter. I called my family and I just ended up wasting their time and they have their own problems to deal with. I shouldn't have even called them, because me and my ex made up and everything was fine. I think maybe I'm going through a depressive episode.

"Hypo/mania symptoms? Last august I kind of went off the deep end. My fianc√© and I were partying for a week and one night after drinking until 3 in the morning we ended up having a threesome with a roommate. I managed to turn the threesome into a poly relationship, ending up in California by Christmas with my ‚Äúnew partner‚Äù. Looking back this was extremely out of character because ive been nearly obsessive jealous and insecure our entire 5 year relationship. My fianc√© (im so incredibly grateful for him) stuck through it with me, I went through an extreme mixed episode in Jan-March; broke up with both partners and moved back into my parents house two years after moving out. 

March to June/July I was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. July I start sleeping less again, august was my birthday. Weird shit started popping up for me, spiritual journeys, thinking people online were bots, seeing shadow people in the corner of my eye in a different part of the house.

I had an extreme break from reality one night when I was 14/15 after an involuntary hospitalization and being pulled out of school. Convinced my family and friends were nurses and doctors and I didn‚Äôt actually get released but that I was hallucinating being at home. It only happened for a few hours that night and I dismissed it as extreme stress. 

I was on MDD treatment as a teenager with just SSRIs and held a job for two years + friends. I stopped taking my medicine and started smoking weed at 17 and moved out. I stopped counseling, I haven‚Äôt held a job for longer than eight weeks since then. 

My PCP said the episode from the year before and extreme depression sounded like BD and gave me medicine to start weaning myself onto slowly. I have a counseling appointment next month.

"My psychologist says that I have either bipolar or cyclothymia  I‚Äôm 16 and I‚Äôm scared. I never thought I had bipolar or anything. I want to join the military or be a firefighter, what if a diagnosis changes everything???

I have my first ever psychiatrist appointment mid December which was recommended by my psychiatrist because they want me on meds for my mood changes. This is all so new to me. I had my first manic episode(or maybe hypomania, I‚Äôm not 100% certain) and it lasted 2 months. I thought I was a god but also felt like I was going to explode from energy. Now I just entered, what my psychologist deemed, a depressive episode. I feel so unsure of everything and completely lost. I don‚Äôt feel like myself but I don‚Äôt know if I even know what myself should feel like? What if I somehow tricked my psychologist into thinking I have bipolar without me knowing?

"if i forgot i was mentally ill i wouldn‚Äôt know who i am this feels so out of pocket to say, but if i forgot i was mentally ill i wouldn‚Äôt know who i am. bipolar doesn‚Äôt fully define me but it has a great deal to do with who i‚Äôve been this far for 22 years. i was diagnosed when i was 20 and ever since that day shit just made sense. the impulsivity, the randomness of the things i do, the heightened emotions. i‚Äôm also an artist and i know that many great artists have it. in no way am i comparing myself to them, though i will say we do have the capacity to be more. not only more, but are very often a lot as we are. and not in a negative sense, but in the sense that we are very strong people, creative people. to live a day within a brain like ours would be hard for a neurotypical person so give yourself a break. and to create with a brain like ours is powerful. 

if you are not a creator i am quiet certain you‚Äôre damn good at what you do. 

all that is to say that those of us who are bipolar, were very strong people. in many ways. we‚Äôre also special. incredibly intelligent. we think outside of the box, we are weird and that is beautiful. we think fast. we think on a vast spectrum. we do things that are out of the blue. 

i know that some of the decisions we make don‚Äôt always impact our lives positively, but they create a story. and i‚Äôve always felt that i am but a character in a novel, with that mindset we can get ahold of the power that lets us recreate our mistakes into a beautiful story. it doesn‚Äôt end where your manic episode led you to. it ends where you end it. you have the power to separate yourself from this disease.

"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm able to love anyone now that I‚Äôm on the right meds In the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù era when I was super unstable, constantly having long, severe episode after long, severe episode, I used to get really intense crushes on people. It was an obsession for me to find all the clues that they loved me but just weren‚Äôt ready to ask me out. I reached a point where I couldn‚Äôt handle being rejected without hurting myself. At one point, a guy told me he loved me back but wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship right then‚Ä¶ and then went on to date someone else.

I thought a guy I‚Äôm friends with was interested in me. Completely convinced he was going to ask me out. I straight up asked him where we at because I was confused by his mixed signals. He apologized for being flirty and leading me on, that he only sees me as a friend.

But there is something new that is really disrupting my life. At night when I try to sleep there are demons in my head that show me death. Me dying, family dying, random people dying in horrible ways such as gory car accidents and burnings. I've never witnessed these things and do not have PTSD.

The demons tell me (I can hear them in my head) that I need to die because I'm evil and deserve to burn in hell with them. When I wake up from nightmares I see them in the corners of even dancing around my bed, and the worst is when I hear demonic growling.

Put my chips up on the table but I didn't think it through

Betting like I'm holding aces when it's really 7 2 (hypomania)

Im putting every single chip I have on the river coming through (critical hypomania when you blow your savings on dumb stuff)

Sometimes you bluff a bad hand, cause you can't let it show (masking depression)

Other times an all in wager when you should have played it slow (hypomania)

Waiting for my next hand, the cards you never know (uncertainty of how I'm going to feel tomorrow or a week from now)

Just trying to keep from folding in this high stakes hi lo (iykyk)

The hand that's dealt to me today i never know til the cards fall

One day I'm holding nothing and the next id bet it all

I wish I could predict it and know what my hand will be

Cause when the chips are running low Id like to plan accordingly (this would be so much fucking easier if it ran on a clock)

If I could color up, cash out, and walk away with what I have

I would do it in a heartbeat but there's no way that I can

So still the cards keep sailing cross the table right at me (this is a lifelong illness and I need to learn to manage)

How do I keep myself from expressing my emotions so much when I feel like a split is coming? I know it‚Äôs not good to not talk about what hurts you but when I do I go overboard way more when sober too? How do you control it? Please any advice. ,bipolar

I was dx with bipolar type ii at 20 after my first episode post a loss in the family. I am 25 now. For the first couple years post diagnosis/medication, I skewed more heavily to depression, and that was generally the case my whole adult life

However, in the last year, my hypomania has seemed to progress. This year I had two separate episodes of visual hallucinations (which I have never experienced before except while on drugs) during hypomanic episodes. Some other symptoms that seem to be worse now include poor sleep, impulsive behaviour and spending, and racing thoughts. The length of my hypomanic episodes is also increasing, from a week or two at most to multiple weeks in a row.

I‚Äôve been consistently taking meds this entire time, and have been raising my dose accordingly as episodes occur. I‚Äôm also in therapy regularly.

"Experience with workplace accommodations Posted about this is r/askHR but I also want to hear from people who can actually relate. 

I've been having a really hard year and my mood has not been stable for several months. And yes I've talked to my provider about it, I've also had a lot of personal stuff going on. I got written up and put on a corrective action plan over the summer. At the time, I wasn't allowing myself to recognize or admit just how bad I was struggling and ask for help. I got it together and did everything they asked. I also then asked for accommodations. I turned everything in to HR and had a conversation with my supervisor about what that could look like with my job. This was really hard for me because I never want to use this disorder as an excuse.

At the beginning of the year I took on some extra PRN work through my agency. Because of everything else I've had going on I got really behind on those assignments. I was so anxious about being behind that I became pretty avoidant when it came to any communication about them and took a long time to respond if I did. I did talk to my supervisor about it somewhat but didn't go into any details about the personal stuff I had/have going on. It's gotten to the point where my (lack of) performance is hurting my agency's position with the agency that contracts us for this work. 

I can accept that I messed up and I had already told them that I no longer wanted these extra assignments after I finished what I had. Today, I was put on a corrective action plan again. And threatened with potential termination. This CAP is pretty strict and it's tasks are primarily for my actual job, which I don't feel like I'm that behind on. The PRN work was a separate position with a separate contract. Mentally, I don't think I can keep up with this right. I'm already stressed about the added tasks each day. Finding another job isn't really an option.

"I switched antidepressants and I became more depressed during the past few days It started over the weekend, on Friday actually.

I think it's because my new med hasn't kicked in yet. I started it almost two weeks.

With depression it mostly manifested as anhedonia and extreme boredom.

I remember being super bored (not being busy over the weekend added to it since I'm a part-time student that isn't working)

I remember I was craving stimulation.

Nothing really made me happy.

I haven't been this like in a while.

Since school week started I'm doing a bit better since I'm more busy with my online class but for most of the day I'm just super bored as try to stimulate myself using my laptop or phone but it isn't enough.

With depression I still lost interest in most of hobbies. I still find it hard to focus and enjoy things like TV, movies, and video games. Things that used to be major time killers for me.

I wish there was something I can do to feel better. Maybe my med will kick next week or two?

"Low frustration threshold Recently, my frustration threshold has been on the floor. 

I started a new job recently, and all the noises that come with being in a shared office have me *stressed.*

And my brother is getting more annoying by day. ""Hi, sister,"" every time he spots me. Then, he repeats himself louder if I don't respond and just try ignoring him. Just today, he was throwing coins at me from across the living room, just trying to get on my nerves. And then he says ""look at this"" at something racist on his phone, so I ignore it, and he PUTS HIS PHONE ON MY FACE, so, naturally, I grabbed his phone and threw it across the floor. 

I'm going to start isolating in my room to avoid everything, just go to work and then go to my room and that's it, but that's not healthy either, and is probably going to lead to a depressive episode.

I might be trending hypomanic right now with the frustration and I keep buying things when I should be watching my spending during this time of transitioning between jobs. Idk, though. My sleep is still fine, so far. Maybe some PTSD symptoms are overlapping? I've felt hypervigilant and jumpy recently, but also kind of spaced out at the same time. 

I'm medication compliant and I have a psychiatry appointment on the 4th. I need to see about restarting therapy once I get my new insurance cards in.

For the last two weeks I have been conducting an experiment to determine a dataset from which I can calculate mood shifts based on external variables. It‚Äôs a simple summation formula with weights that results in a mood state score. You plug in your variables such as sleep, stimuli, stress, pharma, etc. So in order to calculate these weights, I have been using myself as the test subject and systematically running each variable from one extreme to the other. 

As expected, the results have caused some fluctuations in my mood and current state of mind, but I have to complete this mission. If I am to truly understand my diagnoses and avoid being caught off guard by, say, a flu and the resulting need for steroids (which I thought was a trigger but, after recent testing appears not to be), I need tangible, actionable data to be able to course correct.

"Religion and Bipolar Hey, I‚Äôd love to hear people‚Äôs experiences on this topic, if any of you have any. 

In some of my worst hypomanic/ manic (doctor is unsure whether type 1 or 2 yet) episodes, they would always revolve around god, the devil, demons,  the paranormal and spirituality. It‚Äôs interesting because ever since a child I always loved watching ghost hunting programmes and have always had an interest in that type of stuff, but it‚Äôs died off a little as I‚Äôve gotten older. 
Anyway, does anyone have any theories on way mania often includes things like religion? I haven‚Äôt been to church, and had no ties to Christianity, but the manic episodes that were scariest for me were the ones were I felt like for and the devil were talking to me. I was so scared that it would keep me up at night in genuine fear, I even stuck a picture of Jesus on my wall at one point. 
For the past few years I‚Äôve always known that researching to much into religion / spirituality is a downward slope for me, so I tend not to do it.

"Do you have dreams? TL;DR: Do you usually have/remember your dreams down to small details? Are they mostly negative, positive or it's mixed? Also, do you have trouble getting to sleep or maintaining it?  

Contextualized question:  

As far as my memory can go I remember how I always had trouble sleeping. My mother says since I was a very young child I suffer with insomnia. I have both trouble with getting to sleep and then after I finally sleep it doesn't last more than a few hours. When I'm in hypomania I don't sleep at all for up to 3 days in a row without medication.       

About the dreams itself, I was always confused with people talking about them, basically because either I don't dream or don't remember them after I wake up in about 90% of the days.  

It's not that I don't dream ever, it's just that it is so unusual that when it happens I could count in the fingers of one hand in the span of an entire month. The ones I remember are usually very negative/sad involving my fears or full blown senseless nightmares.  

After my diagnosis and medications adjustment I'm prescribed 2 medications to help me sleep, one to induce the sleep but doesn't last long and another one that is weaker and doesn't help me to get to sleep but makes it last a little longer.    

I'm on a stable medication course now with no need for changes in over a year, and suddenly on the last couple months I've been having a lot of memorable dreams and they're not that negative anymore, some are even good ones (although some of those make me sad when I wake up because they're too good).",bipolar

"How common is it for bipolar to go into remission? I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 last year after a hypomanic episode, since starting my medication I haven't experienced any new episodes. I recently got a new psychiatrist and he said it is too early to tell if I'm truly bipolar and that only time can tell. He also said that the goal is for me to stop taking my medication when I'm ""well"" again. He also diagnosed me with BPD, but didn't really want to explain why. I do relate to some symptoms of the BPD criteria, but I feel really confused by all of this. So I'm basically questioning if I ever was bipolar in the first place or if my psychiatrist is wrong.

"How to succeed with this disorder?? (Uni / work) Hey y'all. I was diagnosed in August this year, and since then it's been very difficult to figure out what to do next. 

I started university again, trying to finish my degree that I've abandoned many times, and it was okay at first, but as the workload increased I couldn't keep up. I asked my psychiatrist to put me back on ADHD medication (I was on it before and it helped with school / life immensely) but she said it would be malpractice to do that so soon after my diagnosis. 

Struggling in school (plus the brain fog from mood stabilizers) has just completely thrown me into a depressive episode. I don't know who I am if I can't work or study. I start to have pretty bad thoughts when I think of a life living on the couch collecting disability. Had a panic attack trying to get myself out the door to go to class this morning.

"How to stop obsessing over social media when manic?  Every time I have a manic episode (which usually lasts a couple of months), I become extremely obsessed with social media. I check Instagram, twitter, Facebook, reddit some 100 times a day or more and it leads to incessant posting, obsession w certain people engaging, and just an unnecessary amount of attention to something that normally doesn't bother me. Even when I try not to, I end up just being on the app's all the time like I'm missing something new every 5 seconds. I click way too many photos of myself and find myself not being present in the moment because of this.  

This only happens when I'm manic, and usually because I compare myself so much and start to lose a sense of self, it sends me into a depressive spiral that later turns into a full blown episode with a 100 major issues.

She refuses to take me to doctors to get the treatment I need (medication or hospitalization when things get really bad) because she says ""I don't need it"", but its very clear I do, and I can't seek it myself as I'm a minor. She herself has never saught out help for her BPD or OCD despite it being offered constantly to her because she ""manages"" well enough, even though everyone knows she doesn't.

I was manic for a few weeks, and pretty self destructive. She didn't care, didn't check in on me, and even just made things worse for me. She'd purposefully push me to do worse things or put me in situations that were bad for me just to see what I would do/so she could get mad at me.
Now that I'm coming down from it she's doing the same. I can't leave my bed. I can't shower, or get changed, or brush my teeth, or eat. And she just won't leave me alone.

No one has the time to hear me speak about all of it right now, but I wish I could say, that that was the worst of it, but no, the worst of it it is this come down. I want to die. I want to kill myself, but I can't and I won't. I even had a near death experience during the midst of all this, so I realized, ultimately, I don't want to be dead, but I'm just having a really hard time living. All my worst fears feel like they're coming true. I've been hospitalized before, but this is worse, I think, because this time, I actually had hopes for myself and now they're being tried by fire. I truly don't know how I'm going to survive this but I am trying. It's all I have left. This is quite an induction into this fucked up family, if you don't mind me saying, but I feel at least a little better knowing there are people out there fighting the good fight.

"How do you know you're in remission? Bipolar 2 here. I've never been in remission, but there's more to this question than just the baseline caption.

The last 2 months, I've started to get better than I have in the past. I've been taking walks, hanging with friends less than usual and have spent more ""me time.""

I wouldn't say I'm ecstatic, but I'm doing pretty good. I haven't really cried or gotten nearly as upset as I have in the past over small things. I've started looking into spiritual things with myself. I've sat myself down and started a journal.

I've started hearing more people out on why they think the things they do rather than act on pure emotion. 

I've lost 10 pounds in a month, my A1C is down (wonderful, jouyus.) 

I've been listening to music and have been able to feel it in my soul and understand the meanings of things.

Everything means something to me, but not in the way it used to. My friends roommates described me as ""wise beyond my years."" 

I started to realize, after being 20, I've grown an incomprehensible amount. Everything has its reasonings. But, my question here, if I am in remission, is it normal to miss that feeling that I had been so brought up in and used to?

I fought to live, but didn't live to fight. Have I been stuck so long in my bullshit and constant need to survive, that now I have that peace, I'm missing the thrill? I've never been in remission so I cannot tell if this is a cycle or if I'm second guessing myself so I feel better?

"my partner is debating leaving me i‚Äôm so heartbroken at the moment. yesterday me and my partner had a long conversation about how he has been feeling. He ultimately told me that he feels unprepared and not equipped to deal with my mental health. That my depressive episode has impacted him too much and he just doesn‚Äôt think he can go on much longer. 


I‚Äôm heartbroken, I‚Äôve been in a depressive episode for over a month now because I started a sexual assault survivor group therapy. It‚Äôs been hard on me- I‚Äôve made some ugly realizations during this group. I‚Äôve had a breakdown at least 4 times this week. My breakdowns just include me crying for an hour and then going to bed and sleeping most of my day away. 


My partner said it has broken his heart to see me this way and not be able to help me. He says it breaks his heart because he knows I‚Äôm doing everything I possibly can to get better but that it‚Äôs hard on him to see that sometimes my efforts don‚Äôt result in anything. 


I don‚Äôt blame him. I‚Äôm heartbroken too. I‚Äôm hurt too that sometimes my efforts come to no avail.  I don‚Äôt know what to say or do. 


I explained to him that my bipolar is not something he can fix, and it‚Äôs not his fault. That I will never EVER give up on trying to get better. But that I can ultimately understand if he wants to leave. Because, I know better than anyone else on this earth that this disorder is tiring. He says he‚Äôs willing to give us a try. 


But I thought about it all of today and realized that maybe I should just let him go. Maybe it‚Äôs not worth the attempt. I‚Äôm heartbroken. This was the first relationship I have been genuinely happy in, I have had so much love for him. I‚Äôm heartbroken that it seems it‚Äôs coming to an end very soon. 


I‚Äôm so tired. It feels like this illness rips more from me everyday. I don‚Äôt know what to do, or where to turn. I feel like I just lost the love of my life and I‚Äôm holding on to scraps. 


I know this moment will pass. I know it will get better. But I feel so broken right now.

"Extreme Agitation Hello,


For the last 1.5-2 weeks I‚Äôve been extremely irritable. I‚Äôve also had a few short and random bouts of severe depression that resolve with a day or so. Anyway, my therapist hypothesized that my aggression was due to tapering off an SSRI and a mood stabilizer too quickly. I guess I agree. 

It seems like every noise, every word spoken, or any action that someone else does irritates to me to the extreme. And I do mean extreme. Just moments ago a family member kept talking to me and I started screaming. Everything irritates me to the point of showing severe aggression to people for seemingly small things. I‚Äôm at a total loss.


I‚Äôve tried all the coping skills I‚Äôve learned of and nothing helps at all. I see my therapist tomorrow and my psychiatrist soon too. I will of course be telling them. I just need help finding ways to cope or calm down in the interim. This is extremely disheartening as I‚Äôve been doing so well managing my symptoms over the last year with no inpatient treatments at all. I have to figure something out ASAP. My anger is severe and I can‚Äôt control it. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm watching myself from outside of my body say and do these awful things.

Like for example, I had to attend a meeting without my business partner and she asked me what she missed (pretty much immediately after the meeting) and I couldn‚Äôt remember majority of what had been discussed. Even if I write something down, I forget I wrote it down. I have reminders in my phone to take my meds, but if I don‚Äôt take it immediately, I‚Äôll forget to take it because it‚Äôs like I read the reminder and it goes straight out my brain when I look away. I can go days without showering or making a proper meal because in my head I must have just done it. Food goes bad all the time because to me I just opened it but weeks will go by. 

I think I might be stuck in a weird dissociative state. Like I‚Äôm not present enough in life to retain what is happening. I wasn‚Äôt always like this.. I don‚Äôt know when it got so bad. It‚Äôs hard to maintain relationships with people because I just don‚Äôt think about reaching out, cause again, in my head I just talked to them. I have a hard time having conversations because I don‚Äôt know what to talk about because I don‚Äôt really have a lot of experiences since I‚Äôve lost most of my friendships. When I do see a friend, I‚Äôm constantly thinking about the time so I can get back home to just zone out and barely exist. 

I don‚Äôt really feel depressed though either. I just feel very neutral. Don‚Äôt really care about anything. I force myself to work and am very blessed to be self employed..

Backstory details: I was parentified, so asking people for help or support is my biggest fear. I also withdrew from friends for years because of how severe my condition was.

Current details: Because of my backstory I have only managed to stay in distant contact with 2 friends via text. I have only kind of recently this year started to share about my diagnosis. I started out just reconnecting with both of them, apologizing profusely, and only asking details about them and their lives. After a couple months, I shared my condition. Both of these friends reacted in fear initially, supporting my delusions of ""I'm unlovable, I'm worthless, everyone literally hates me..."" blah blah I'm sure y'all know üòÖ

I want to remain in contact with these friends because I LOVE them, but I'm also recognizing that I need support in a depressive episode.

I thought i was normal with my friendships, but i realised im a really bad friend. Not like directly, but im so selfish , i use my friendships to get what i want but im not very reciprocal. This is only with my secure friends. I usually tend to ‚Äútest‚Äù them the most with my mental health. I try not to bc i know its bad.

But if i feel insecure ill become so helpful and give a lot. I want them to like me so bad ill constantly be monitoring their emotions and mothering and fawning.

I was in a few wards and made plenty of traditional art there I may post later depending on things.

"people who grew up with bipolar disorder, how have things changed?

but despite all of this, despite sleeping little (every 3 days), doing impulsive things, talking for 6 hours straight, using drugs that i used once in my life and hated when i was 20.. despite everything seeming like a huge mess destined for a giant fall, there‚Äôs one thing that i didn‚Äôt have when i didn‚Äôt have so much experience, understanding, and acceptance of the illness: awareness.  
there‚Äôs a voice in my head that knows it will go wrong, that this will have a price, that it‚Äôs not sustainable, and that it simply isn‚Äôt worth compromising my sanity and stability. that awareness that we‚Äôve gained over time, which knows that we are getting close to the limit, so it‚Äôs good to take small measures, no matter how small, before it becomes unbearable.

"Recent Bipolar (Pre)Diagnosis Hello all, 

For some time now I have been suspecting I have bipolar disorder (mainly because of manic, or hypo manic episodes). This week, I opened up to my University‚Äôs therapist and she said my symptoms are indeed of Bipolar Disorder. However, she can‚Äôt officially diagnose me (hence I said pre-diagnosis), only my University‚Äôs psychiatrist department can, which is a long process and I‚Äôd only be able to be seen in December. But she said it‚Äôs pretty certain that I have it. 

Anyways, I guess I‚Äôm coming on here for some guidance. And because I feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with me, mostly because I feel like when people are diagnosed with bipolar, they are pretty sad about it, but I can‚Äôt help thinking to myself ‚Äúobviously I would have bipolar, nearly all great people in history had it, of course I would as well.‚Äù Almost like this god-like, narcissist thinking. But then I also keep thinking that I am gaslighting myself, and my therapist, into thinking that I have bipolar when I don‚Äôt.

Also, how long does it take you to go from a depressive episode to a manic? Because I‚Äôd say that Monday/Tuesday I was at rock bottom, like truly rock bottom. I hated my life, wanted to die, wanted to withdraw from this semester, etc. But then, after like 4 days I can already feel getting the god-complex energy that is associated with manic/hypo manic episodes? Like I can feel deep in my body getting more confident and more energetic. But I also feel like 4 days is such a short amount of time to transition from rock bottom depression to a hypo manic episode? Or is this normal in Bipolar Disorder? But then also, I keep thinking it‚Äôs all in my head? And that I am consciously making myself feel this way? I don‚Äôt know if all of this makes sense, but I would truly appreciate some insight and if this is familiar to you or when you were diagnosed.

"Is it normal to look for attention Context : 21M just got out of a hard depressive episode (just starting to be manic). My sister just got 2 twins with another baby starting kindergarten so by extension all my mom‚Äôs and family attention was on her. Plus she got through post partum depression.
I helped my sister a lot took care of the babies and my older niece etc‚Ä¶

But when the day she was in labor I started drinking more and more, and taking benzos more and more. To the point where my mom cried and warned me multiple times, until she kicked me out of the house.

"Bipolar mild episodes coming through meds but I have no idea until it's over The thing is, I emotionally feel about the same all the time. Neutral or slightly negative/pessimistic. Probably anxious.

I've caught myself many times writing pages on pages of ideas and thoughts and analysis of those thoughts, cleaning the whole house and doing all the laundry and dishes after midnight. I'll make progress on projects and studying.

Then when I make it back to baseline I realize it was strange that I was doing those things - I felt totally normal emotionally and somatically.

Then I'll have a few weeks with bad dreams, sleeping much longer than usual, not getting much done, playing a lot of video games on the couch, not wanting to see friends, hating my job. But I don't feel *sad* or depressed inside.

These episodes are very mild compared to the utter destruction that was my unmedicated bipolar. But I think it's fascinating that symptoms are still happening behaviorally even though my inner world feels about the same.

I was so stressed out I had to leave for my mental health. I have been trying to get back into the workforce and be a somewhat productive member of society. I have been job hunting for most of this year for part time positions that I think wouldn‚Äôt make me cry.

"I was Ghosted by my therapist About two years ago I was ghosted by my therapist. I had been seeing her since 2017 and I thought we had had a good relationship. I thought we were close. I guess not. 
She was always a little flaky if I‚Äôm being honest but I attributed it to the fact that she had ADHD. I also have ADHD as well as the bipolar  disorder. 
When the pandemic started we had to switch to calls instead of seeing each other in person. After we switched she would constantly cancel appointments and reschedule them. I was annoyed by it but didn‚Äôt say anything. I‚Äôm way too much of a people pleaser. I should have said something but I didn‚Äôt. Oh well. 
Anyway, during the summer of 2022 she was cancelling appointments a lot more and always apologizing. I let it go because she had a lot going on in her life, but it did make me feel bad. One day, she texted that she had to cancel our appointment again and that she was so sorry. I replied with my usual message of no worries, it happens. She replied back that I must think she‚Äôs awful. I said I didn‚Äôt and that was the last I ever heard from her. She never texted back or anything. 
One thing I should mention about having ADHD is that you have problems with rejection. They hit REALLY hard and it feels devastating. So you can imagine how I felt after I didn‚Äôt hear back from her. As the days passed the feeling of rejection got worse and worse. I still feel it to this day and I think that I‚Äôm scarred from that experience. I need a new therapist and I‚Äôm scared about being rejected again, or not being able to find someone that I work well with. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt even know how to go about finding a new therapist. I know with my insurance that I have to make an appointment with my PCP and go and see them and talk about going back to therapy, but I‚Äôm scared. Oh well. Maybe I‚Äôll do it one day. ",bipolar

It's hard to tell because i don't always straight up see two images but sometimes I just get a general sensation of being unable to see in any sort of detail, but if I close one eye that always helps a lot. 
 
There's nothing wrong with my eyes, I've had them checked by an optician, orthoptist, and ophthalmologist for this issue. So I think it must be a brain thing, then add in that it worsens when I'm depressed makes that seem even more likely 
 
In case it's relevant, this episode looks quite different to how mine tend to look. I am more irritable and angry, not really eating (maybe not a bad thing as I am obese), not really getting any sleep (like going to bed at 11pm and waking up at 1am and struggling to get back to sleep) and feel like I am wading through blancmange, also I'm like very aware of how visibly tired I am like i can feel it all round my eyes. I'm very slowed down but also quite restless at times. Like walking down the street seems like it requires all the energy in the world and I'm still walking slower than normal but if I am sat down I'm constantly fidgeting and bouncing my leg way more than normal (and I already do this quite a bit at baseline).

"Does anyone try to get sick notes from a doctor other than a psychiatrist? I'm new to the corporate world and figuring out how to handle my BP1 in my 9-5.

Thankfully I've been stable for a bit over a year now, and I'm doing everything in my power to stay well for as long as possible. But I'm wondering how I might handle things if/when I do have a new episode. 

If I or the people close to me ever notice me developing manic symptoms, I plan to call out sick so that I don't do anything on the job that could harm my reputation or get me fired. My job requires a note from a doctor for me to be granted sick leave, but I'm worried that once the note comes from my psychiatrist, people at work will realise I have a mental health issue (even if the note itself doesn't disclose what's happening).
I live in a country that's very backwards when it comes to mental health and our anti-discrimination laws are very new. So, I don't want to risk anyone at my work getting even the slightest idea that I might have a mental illness.

Here's my question: For those of you who use sick leave/PTO during episodes and need a doctor to sign off on it, do you avoid getting your sick note from your psychiatrist? Do you try to get it from a GP/family doctor instead?",bipolar
"I hate that even good things can trigger mania.  (30 year old female diagnosed 2 years ago but have been stable this year)

I am really into community theatre; I‚Äôve been doing shows since I was a kid. However, as I got older I started to do them less and less. Recently I saw that a local theatre group was putting on one of my favorite musicals so I auditioned and I got the lead role! This is my first show in years and it‚Äôs been so exciting.

Last night was opening night and I was beyond nervous and excited. My heart was pounding in my chest. The whole night was a whirlwind and it went amazingly. Afterwards I was riding the adrenaline rush of performing for 350 people. 

But when I got home I struggled to sleep (my first warning sign) and by morning I was feeling euphoric and extremely productive. And despite not getting great sleep, I feel amazing.

Called my doc right away and told them what‚Äôs up and we are handling it. But it is so frustrating to me that even something good/exciting can trigger a manic episode.. 

Sometimes it‚Äôs extremely sobering to realize this is a balance act I am going to have to manage for the rest of my life :(
That for the rest of my life, I‚Äôm going to have to be careful and mindful, even when good things happen..

"How do you reconcile the effects of bipolar rage and how you are perceived TLDR: How do you reconcile the long term effects bipolar rage takes on the public perceptions of who you are; With self perception and how other people perceive you.

I had a 1:1 with my boss and I asked him if I've been 'too much' recently. 

I've been 'in my ways' now for a little bit and I'm only now piecing that together.  The rage is so bad.  It's not all the time, but anything that would upset me gives me the same full body reaction that seeing someone kick my dog would.  The immediate fire in my veins and the pressure against my bulwark of control breaks.  I feel so justified in the moment and even for a time after.  I'll swear in ways that scare me, wish curses upon the things 'against me',  i'll thrash and punch the air, grit my teeth (did i really growl?), blow out my voice screaming in the car.  I come with facts, reasons, explanations, it IS everyone else that did this to me...at least that's how I feel at the time.  

I yelled at my landlord for cutting down a brush pile, he is so nice and caring, he didn't deserve that.  I love the birds and animals that visited it; I talk to them at my birdfeeder every morning, they center me.  My feelings are valid, my reactions are not.  This isn't the first time it's happened recently.  I can feel him souring on me.  Asking my partner if I'm mad at him. 

My boss told me that people walk on eggshells around me, and that it's not just those in my department now.  We recently moved to an 'open office' (what a joke.  talk about the worst thing for productivity, and a nightmare for managing bipolar).  We're a very small company all in one room now; and with no where to hide, everyone gets to experience 'me' for the first time.  I'm friendly when not enraged,  I'm very friendly, people like me and would go out of their way to talk to me.  I stand out visually, i'm goofy, i like to bring happiness and spontaneity to the work place.  It's actually been a problem before, where i have to hide to get work done just because people want to talk to me all the time. 

This has changed since the move; My rage in the lab echos out into the open room.  i see it in how people talk to me.  they don't joke around out of the blue anymore.  they don't greet me with fun gestures.  I'm scary now.  What was fun about me is now a warning sign. 

I'm sure my boss knows I'm bipolar.  He's confided things to me on late night drives out to testing labs.  He was happy to see me leave the office or start going on walks when the rage kicks in.  I told him this is something that happens outside of work too, and I'm aware and working on being better.  I'll never actually say it, and he'll never actually call it by name.  I'm thankful for that.  

It's just so hard knowing that the person i am and want to be has to contend with the person i'm overtaken by; that is out to destroy Me on such a fundamental level. I feel like being a recluse against my social wants is the only way to keep people safe; to keep my public persona safe.  It's like being a werewolf, only i don't know when the change happens. 

I'm on my rescue meds now.  i'm working from home until i'm more certain i'm okay.  How does everyone deal with the long term effects on who you are?  How do you apologize.  I know there's no going back, and time is the only way things can heal, but any outburst entrenches things deeper.  It just sucks to know that who i 'am' is controlled so much by forces outside of me. ",bipolar

"Lost a friendship I have a friend who I lost due to my bipolar/PTSD. She said that I never considered the trauma she had to go through helping me out, and that it was making her physically ill. I also said some things I regret about how she wasn't there for me, which I think really pushed her over the edge. A couple months ago she sent me this long text about how I had been too belligerent and confrontative when manic, and that the person she knew me as was ""well and truly gone."" But she also has not given me the chance to show that I am still here and doing a lot better than I was when this rift grew between us.

I genuinely thought this person would be my lifelong friend, and it's hard to put into words how it feels to lose her. But it hurts because she doesn't seem to register that my actions were severely impacted by mental illness and seems to blame things on my personal failings or poor choices. A mutual friend told me she suspected that this person thought I had a drug problem (a sore spot for her due to family trauma, but also untrue). She also started distancing herself from me when I began to have doubts our shared faith and felt that as a result ""our relationship could never be what it was.""

I don't know...I wish I could have the chance to regain her trust. I'm respecting her boundaries, but I'm considering sending her a birthday present and it's got me in my head.

"Experiencing psychotic symptoms for the first time is really scary. Previously diagnosed BP-2. Recently started experiencing psychotic symptoms which makes me strongly suspect BP-1. Waiting for my next appointment for confirmation.

   Recently I've been experiencing tactile hallucinations (formication: feeling of bugs crawling on skin). I've never hallucinated in the past to my knowledge and it's scary.
   
When it started it was only in bed and I drew the very reasonable conclusion that there must be bugs in my bed. (I have cats, it very well could have been fleas or mites of some sort.)
   
Deep into the sickeningly familiar all nighter that signals the start of my manic episode, here I am at 3AM desperately looking for bugs that I would never find. I wrote it off as them simply jumping away when I shone a light and tried and failed to sleep through the discomfort. Several nights in a row where I actually get sleep, still feeling them, but never finding them.
   
In a sleep devrived haze I attempted to self medicate my ADHD with caffeine which I have unknowingly done for years until I got my diagnosis recently. The 300mg plus the sleep deprivation triggered the hallucination again and the reality finally sunk in that I was hallucinating. What are the chances that they were in my clothes and just decided to start after I drank caffeine. I think near zero.
   
Thankfully I now have the insight that it isn't real, but it's an omen of what I can only imagine is more to come. I can't fully trust my senses anymore. It scares the shit out of me. It feels like my life is headed for a nosedive.

"When meds go wrong Hi everyone, alright so a little story about my week. I should start with how I spoke to fellow patients at the hospital‚Ä¶hi my name is (patient #) and this is my week. I started with working the beginning of the week, I was very low on a depression, the third week precisely, I was self harming and and just all around felt bad. The previous week I saw my psychiatrist who briefly listened to my issue and prescribed more meds. Forward to the next week at work, at this point I‚Äôm on all my meds including the new one. 

Before the end of the day as I‚Äôm holding a nineteen thousand dollar piece of equipment (I work as a contractor for the U.S. govt and military is all I can say) I started to shake and fell to the floor, losing consciousness and the ability to get up. After getting help and the on staff nurse getting me up on a stretcher I came to and next thing I know I‚Äôm sent to the hospital. They noticed the harm on my body and I was baker acted. 

I spent five days in the mental hospital, sharing a room with a fellow inmate (lol) i got worse before getting better. I slept that night and most of the next day, missing breakfast but they woke me for my meds, which I tried refusing as I trusted no one and was paranoid. Later that day the hospital‚Äôs psychiatrist came to see me, I was laying down, crying, scared and not sure what to do anymore. He was talking but I didn‚Äôt understand him at first. Then he tells me about my meds. He mentioned that seizures are highly possible when I take two meds together that cause them. I ask which ones, one I was taking and the new one I was on, he mentioned they shouldn‚Äôt be taken together. 

I felt betrayed at my current dr who prescribed me the meds but it made me think I should have checked too, I‚Äôm the one taking them, I saw so mad at myself. He got me off my old med and started the new one, two days later I felt more together, and began participating with others in group activities and the various food schedule. I was getting better pretty quick, I noticed I stuttered a lot more than usual, I was also tested for autism but I knew I had been already. Once I felt better I still had a little over two days there, so I coped by talking to others who were with it, and helped those who weren‚Äôt getting it. Especially by the staff who looked down on us for our conditions, you‚Äôll know which ones do this. 

I helped a young girl by getting her off walls that she was hitting her head on and got someone to talk to her (I‚Äôm very socially anxious, I could only do so much) as well as walk slower with a lady using a walker so not only to help her but to be there to listen to what she had to say. I even got a lonely shy girl company to some bubbly personality‚Äôs that I knew she felt safe with. While the staff paid attention to the medical side, I loved being able to help with the social side of the hospital. I didn‚Äôt feel suicidal or want to harm myself anymore, I just wanted to help again. 

I‚Äôm afraid of becoming my worse self but I understood when I was there that everyone has their own battles, and life‚Äôs never perfect but to keep yourself in check and get the help you need as soon as possible, if your dr can‚Äôt see you soon during a crisis, please go to the hospital or find a dr who can see you. It could have been much worse for me, I could have been driving that day, but I was lucky, and met some truly amazing people like the rest of us. Thank you for reading. ",bipolar

"Coworkers keep making negative comments and jokes about bipolar I have had a long mental health history since I was 14, and 3 1/2 years ago I had my first full blown manic episode and was officially diagnosed with BP1 and started on mood stabilizers.

"I think my mixed episode is getting worse... I've come to the horrible realisation around two days ago that I may have been in a mixed episode for more than a week or so. I keep switching between the worst despair of my life, barely taking care of myself, hating myself and crying and oversleeping to euphoria, thinking I'm the best person alive, barely sleeping, multitasking, rambling, overposting on social media, cleaning, pacing, irritable, racing thoughts and agitated and paranoid. 

Today, I woke up at 2 30 am with 2-3hrs of sleep and wrote a poem, drew art, cleaned my living room and rearranged my room and rambling on and on to my mum. I also ended up snapping at my dad.

"Just want to rant  Just wanna talk. 

In a manic state, I usually get myself in predicaments that I can‚Äôt really get out for a while. A couple years ago I got myself into so much debt because I took out loans just so I can spend it all on nonsense. I‚Äôm still reeling from all that and getting my credit back on track. 

This time, while not as bad, I decided I would be a soccer coach. Bad idea. I know enough about soccer to yell out on the sidelines but coaching an entire team how to play and what to do? 

I should‚Äôve known with my anxiety that it wouldn‚Äôt have worked. But I did it. Luckily, the season is almost up. But I had a parent call me out publicly about how bad I‚Äôm doing.   It really sucked. Really hurt my feelings. 

I didn‚Äôt expect to be the best of the best or anything. But it still hurt. My depression has come full force and that‚Äôs one of the things driving me down further. 

I‚Äôm definitely not doing that again. 

Update to anyone reading this: 

I learned tonight during the last practice that the rest of the parents and all the kids want me to coach again and they request me. I was thinking I let these kids down while the whole time being the supportive/encouraging coach the kids needed. 

May have been the best impulsive decision I‚Äôve made yet. ",bipolar

The thing is that I don't especially feel sad or anything, I am just extremely tired of all this crap happening to me. Paranoia and hallucinations are something that I really struggle with on a daily basis since I'm a teen and the ""shit"" I did while manic doesn't help either. I have hurted a lot of people that didn't deserved it at all, sometimes I just don't really care that much but the guilt comes out of nowhere all the time. I'd just like some rest, idk how to explain.. I'd like to feel some peace in me one day, not thinking about the past, the psych ward etc.. I hate myself and other people seems to feel it.

"A Poem I Wrote This is a poem dedicated to all those who struggle with or love someone with bipolar disorder. I acknowledge the incredible courage, strength, loyalty and love that is required to stay.  

Waves 

Cyclical, predictable 
Yet
Each unique
The intense, tumultuous rush
The slow, steady retreat 

Crashing into everything 
Crash
Crash
Crash
Crash

Unrelenting
Unsteady
Unpredictable 

Retreat 

The quiet 
The darkness 
The grief 
The calm 
But 
It will be high tide again before long

And then low tide again
High
Low
High
Low
Can we predict it? 
The moon has control 

Sometimes steady
Sometimes churning
Sometimes blissful
Sometimes calm



Sometimes gone 



But I choose.

To remain.

For it all.

I stay 
I change
I stay
I long 
I stay
I feel
I stay
For it all

Even when the sand hardens and cracks 
As I look around
I parch and I wither
And I‚Äôm dying to drown

I stay 
I stay
I stay
I stay 

Because off in the distance 
When I‚Äôm about to give in
I see it
A wave 
Returning


In staying there is wisdom
It returns 
Always
To quench my soul 
And remind me
Why

The bipolar part of this, is there any advice you guys can give me to grieve properly with bipolar. These things usually invoke a huge emotional toll and after mixed existential episodes. And i have such a hard time managing emotions

And i already have contacted my therapist, journaled, and have family and friends. Some who will be with me. But i just don‚Äôt know if it will be enough  

And I am so lost and scared, and hoping more than ever there is a god. And scared she will give me the same eyes she did when i picked her from the litter box.

This whole week I've had thoughts of suicide. My life has been pretty stagnant since I was 19 after my first hospitalization. The decision I made that day will forever have an imprint on my life and still effects me to this day. A few years ago I made a pact with myself that if my life didn't turn around by 30 that I would end my life. It was around the time I turned 21 and these past 4 years have gone by very quickly.

"I think a manic episode is trying to happen  To summarize everything, I just I feel like I stoped potentially triggering a manic episode before anything happened, because I feel fine now and I had someone to help me and keep me in reality


I don't know how to explain it so bear with me. I woke up and felt like I was going to have a bad day even tho I felt fine. I got to work and everything started to go wrong. Everyone was a tad bit meaner and everything just somehow went wrong too.
I work overnights so there being no sun didn't really make me feel better.

And then I started getting the most horrible cramps and it felt like if I didn't get out of their right now I was going to freak out on someone or cry uncontrollably and would probably lose my job, so I collected my self and asked to leave home early.

Once I got home and I got undressed and went to sleep I started freaking out. I was seeing things even tho I knew nothing was their I was freaked out. My partner held me and talked to me even tho they where half asleep they helped me until I calmed down and fell asleep. In those moments I remember thinking that if I didn't calm down I would trigger something cuz I felt my grip on reality start slipping away and I was so close to losing my
shit.

Their could be a couple reasons, i've been dealing with a lot and came to realize that I probably have BPD on top of my Bipolar 1 and PTSD. And it's been a lot of weird feelings but a lot of understanding why I am the way I am. And I also got out of a relationship like 4 months ago and just entered a new one(we clicked really fast).

"The feeling of falling within myself  Feeling like I‚Äôm falling psychically 

Hi, y‚Äôall. I have bipolar 1 with psychosis, for which I recently was hospitalized. I‚Äôve been out about 10 days and was starting to feel a lot better but today I experienced something I haven‚Äôt before. I have had thoughts of suicide which I usually make a joke of and brush aside, which usually puts an end to the train of thought. But today, after a rough day where I was catfished and they attempted to get extort me because I stupidly was snap chatting them videos (I was cognizant enough not to put my face in anything), and also I found out the woman I love is seeing and very happy with someone else. 

I was dazed by all of that yesterday, and today as I was still processing everything after I got home a feeling overtook me that felt like I was rootless and falling within myself with no end to it in sight (my usually joking manner was off the table). This lasted about thirty minutes before I was able to bring myself to the shower which snapped me out of it partially, at least enough where I wasn‚Äôt feeling afraid in my gut like I was. 

I‚Äôve never taken anything about my suicidal thoughts seriously, there has always been a distance in my mind between the thoughts and how I feel about life and my prospects. This experience was qualitatively different and I feel afraid that I am being undercut by the currents of my life, it was like I wasn‚Äôt present- there was only the pain and discomfort pulling me away from myself. I guess I‚Äôm wondering if this resonates with anyone here, I‚Äôve never felt so lonely in my life. Music and nicotine can only do so much work, I‚Äôve never feared my own psyche so much even with my psychoses. Thanks.

"Random Question Hey bipolar fam, I got a question for you!

I recently created a crisis plan for both manic and depressive episodes and I found that while I was working on it, and in the period after it was complete I felt FUCKING INCREDIBLE.

Not in a mania sort of way, but it felt like I had control, or was taking control back and it made me feel like there WAS something I could do to change things.

Problem is, is was a sort of fleeting moment.  I‚Äôm still really proud of it, and I‚Äôve used it to check myself periodically and it‚Äôs been super helpful in terms of educating people around me.

My question for you all:

Do you have any documents / educational materials you‚Äôve created with regard to your care that you think might be useful to mimic?

"Any 50+ bipolars out there? CW: SI 50F, diagnosed BP-II at 41 after being incorrectly diagnosed as MDD for the previous 16 years. For the last 5 years or so, I have become increasingly just ""done"" with life. My physical health is beginning to decline; joint pain, early-stage kidney disease, digestive problems, a stomach that looks like I'm pregnant with twins. It has become impossible to determine which of my mood/physical symptoms are a failure/result of my meds versus perimenopause.

With the average lifespan of bipolar people being 10-20 years less than the general population, I fluctuate between ""make the most of what remains"" and ""I can't do this another 10 years."" Lately the latter has been winning. The SI is a near-daily passenger. It's all depression, all of the time- no mania at all since 2019-ish.

My current health insurance is hot garbage, so seeking adequate treatment has become tougher, with appeals/referrals sometimes taking months. My psych isn't in-plan, so every appointment is $175. The possibility that my treatment-resistant depression is the result of years of incorrect meds makes me furious.

I wonder if it could be more so the thrill/ adrenaline of the job that draws bipolar people to the field. Or if there‚Äôs a deeper desire to care for people medically? 

I understand that this is likely a causation/ correlation situation. More people may just be getting diagnosed, and it‚Äôs becoming more acceptable to talk about mental health.

"Lifestyle vs medication Hey all,

  
I feel like i'm using this thread a lot at the moment as trying to gain more insight so I can move forward, really appreciate everyone on it.

  
I'm just wondering what are peoples thoughts about the importance of lifestyle. I am currently medicated but it's far from perfect and I wouldn't say I'm stable, my better episodes are just lasting longer. I'm a rapid cycler for context. 

 I'm aiming to return to my PhD and move out of my parents at the beginning of next year. This feels like a leap and a risk while not fully stable but is something that is motivating me and helping me to see a way out of previous suicidal depression, which was fed on feeling absolutely stuck and trapped. I'm currently living at my parents which I have real issues around. Because I want to relocate it would be quite a journey to keep trying different medications at the moment and risks further destabilisation and is therefore something I want to focus on when I'm resettled in the place I want to be long-term. Do you think you should be completely stable medication-wise before making a life change? 

  
I'm trying to get used to the fact that I will have to deal with this for life and the rapid cycling might not go. I feel like life changes might enable the circumstances for these episodes to improve naturally? Is this naive or have people felt that getting their life to a more positive space has had a big impact on their episodes? Maybe this is completely naive, but I didn't used to always experience my moods like this, so why would they have to stay stuck like this for ever. 

  
I've also only been on my meds for under 3 months so feel rapid cycling could take a while to realign.

I am losing hope. Despite doing everything right, down to the meds, sleep and excersise routines; I can feel my will to live is slipping. It's deeper than just depression, it is an objective lack of mental ressources to handle the normal everyday changes, and in the past 5 years my abilities to manage normal stress has diminished at an accelerated rate. I'm at the point where my wife has noticed my personality changing over the years. Her being around me, talking to be, interacting with me, is HARD for me to handle now. I need frequent and sudden time-outs to retreat to recoup my focus, and my mood swings are insane - I'll make her favorite coffe in the morning, then when she talks a little too much I'll shut down and leave without warning because I'm getting irritable for no reason , my hands may even shake, and I desire only peace and quiet.

This is affecting my entire life. I'm not contacting my friends or family on and off from one week to the next, because I simply lack the mental ressources to do so. It seems to come in waves too, one week can barely cope, next week full recluse - repeat.

The worst part is, I can't hold a job down (obviously). And my wife is pregnant at 20 weeks. 

Pregnant. New baby. 20 weeks. Months of shitty sleep, heightened demands on me and her both, and I am EXHAUSTED already.

I want to end things. It's not possible where I live, but I dream bi-weekly about going to France and paying for being put out. I have stock funds that can cover it.

"Finally accepting my BP1 diagnosis after 14 years I am 34F and was diagnosed with a mood disorder at 20 after an episode of drug-induced psychosis/mania. I was re-hospitalized at 27 after experiencing mania. Even after my official BP diagnosis, my parents and I had a hard time accepting my diagnosis - chalking it up to insomnia - due to the social stigma that comes with the diagnosis.

I had periods without medication and was completely weaned off by 30, as was urged by my parents, and for the past four years, I did have a period of relative stability. In retrospect, I recognize the periods of mania/hypomania/depression I experienced in the last two years. But perhaps because I was working from home, I had managed to get through this period without medication. Through therapy and meditation, I also learned many coping mechanisms.

One reason why my parents, specifically my mother, wanted me to stay off medication was how it could potentially affect pregnancy. But I now finally realize how I must prioritize my mental health over pleasing or worrying my parents for a potential future that has not even happened.

This spring, I completely spiraled out and ended up quitting my job of four years. For the past 2 months I've been in a state of major depression, unable to do anything productive other than simple house chores, binge eating for emotional comfort, and see no hope for the future.

I finally decided that this is enough and decided to seek help and accept the fact that I need to take medication this week! Call it placebo, but I am already feeling so much more lifted in my mood and can start to see hope at the end of the tunnel. I can see how I was under the illusion and denial that I was fine and that the doctors were wrong. I've been living with the shame that comes from the stigma of the diagnosis, even from my parents. I so wanted to believe that I was ""normal"". I believed that I was fine without the medication because whatever suffering I faced, the side effects would be worse.

Currently, I have a lot of big life questions, about finding a job & a partner. While going back to medication may not seem like a big deal to others, I am really proud of myself for taking this step towards recovery and hopefully towards stability. I wanted to share my story in case it helps anyone else reading this as reading about others' journeys has helped me. ",bipolar

"My parents got mad at me for intentionally overdosing Hopefully this doesn't break rule 12 because I'm okay now. A couple months ago I got into a friendship ending fight and I got so upset that I overdosed. I don't know if it was a suicide attempt or not but I really regretted it, because I overdosed just a week before that and I went to work while I was blacking out and vomiting, so I got really scared and called my biological dad.


My biological dad was... more disappointed, and scared, than irritated. Because he told me to call him before this happens again just a couple hours before I did this (I told him about my previous attempt). He started yelling at me to tell my step-dad and my biological mom. So I went to tell them, but I didn't want them to know I overdosed, so I just told them my stomach hurt and I think I ""accidentally"" took too much medication.


My step-dad said he didn't want to take me to the hospital over a ""stomach ache"" even though I told him I was really scared. So I called my bio-dad again and let him know what was going on and he demanded I told my parents the truth. So I went back out there and handed my step-dad the phone, and my bio-dad told my step-dad it was an intentional overdose.


My bio-dad by this point was getting really upset and threatened to call the police if he didn't take me to the hospital. This really pissed off my step-dad and he threatened to call the police on my bio-dad for... whatever. And they got into this fight and then they hung up. And the police called my phone, basically telling me they're not doctors and that if I want to go to the hospital then I should.


This pissed off my bio-dad even more and eventually he dragged me off to the hospital to where I was taken to inpatient care.


Before he showed up, my mom woke up and asked what was going on. My step-dad explained and she got super irritated, telling me I was ""waking her up"", that I was ""being mean"", I should've ""known better than to overdose"", and then she went back to bed. My step-dad got really pissed at me, didn't answer me when I started talking to him, just shook his head and sighed and went back to bed.


I don't know what to do. It's been a couple months now and they're no longer acting mad at me, they're just acting like nothing happened except for the fact my two dads now hate each others guts. And it's my own fucking fault.


My abusive mom and my step-dad who let it all happen. Of course they don't care about me that much. They might act like they love and care about me, who the fuck does that to someone who overdosed and is telling you ""I'm bipolar and I'm going to kill myself?""

"Visions of the Future? I‚Äôm still trying to decipher for myself as is my psychiatrist if what I‚Äôm experiencing is BP2 but in my last suspected hypomanic period, I was having these *visions* most often between sleep and wake that were vivid and also predictive. 

Examples: 

- I had a waking vision that I was rolling around in dirt, covering my face in it, eating it Yellowjackets style and I thought all of this was very dark despite having a spiritual connection with the substance of soil. I was reading a book about empathy voraciously during this hypomanic phase and was, at this point, on an early chapter about different meditations. The visuals of rolling in dirt kept with me throughout my attempts to meditate that morning. After 10 minutes of attempting meditation, I read a few pages of the ebook to arrive at a section about ‚Äúearthing‚Äù/grounding in soil recommending reader go outside and sink into the dirt. 

- I was trying everything to not be so jumpy so I bought an accupressure mat. My first time trying it, 15 minutes in with my eyes closed, I see these specific red green and yellow waves of light in a circular shape just hanging above me. The next day, desparate for sleep, I asked to go to an aunt‚Äôs house to try napping on her couch. I walk into her house to see a painting I‚Äôd never before seen of Jesus surrounded by the exact colors I saw in the exact shape and texture I saw them. It felt similar enough to be startling. 

‚Äî- 

There were many more examples like this I‚Äôve since forgotten because I didn‚Äôt write them all down. I worried so much that admitting these things to a psychiatrist would get me re-considered for psych ward time OR that my doctor might think I was doing some fantastical religious fixation/hallucination thing and so I didn‚Äôt mention them. 

They didn‚Äôt seem harmful. They seemed magical actually.

It was like I could feel everything without the mania being right around the next corner. I could be sad, or happy or excited even angry and the mania never came.

I don't know if anyone else know what I mean. For me normally experiencing strong swings in emotions used to trigger my mania.

 I quit my job because I can no longer stand on my feet lifting and pulling as a nurses aide for twelve hours. I am suffering from hypertension, with both pulsatile tinnitus and euatachian tube dysfunction and iih. I have felt like I am stroking out with the tension headaches for the last two months. I am on lamotrigine, and my therapist will not change my rx to topamax, which has been shown to help iih. No one in my family likes me, and my Father is my last living relative besides my daughter. My younger daughter died on a previous trip to Colorado, and my families only response was to tell me how much they disliked me. She was twenty one and hit and killed by a car walking home. Every pulse and pound and pop in my head lets me know I might stroke out soon, but my life had been so hard I just don't care? I have to get enough motivation to make this trip to Colorado.  I am unsure is lamotrigine is making my iih worse.
 Really should I be concerned about controling possible mania when my bp on bp medicine can run 163/118? I think I just have to survive right now.
 My hypertension and pulsatile tinnitus started during my first and only known manic/ phycotic episode after my Mother died two years ago. I read right after that that late diagnosis was linked to worse physical outcome and more depression.

She responded with ‚Äú I absolutely have  to protect my  mental share of mind right now. However for you to put a blanket on the entire experience, as a direct catalyst for your feelings of being unsafe, is not fair and not taking accountability for who you are as a person, and other people in your life.

"Does anyone else feel like the memories of their life is not their own? When I think about memories I have, even from only a couple months ago, they feel so distant. It's like I'm remembering something that a friend said that they experienced, even though I'm aware that it's definitely my own past. 

Sometimes I don't remember things that I definitely should remember at ALL.. For example, I found an old after visit summary from about a year ago that my psychiatrist wrote from when I was trialing a mood stabilizer. I genuinely could not recall some of the side effects or concerns I was having when trialing the meds. I couldn't even remember how my mood was at the time I was trialing the meds... the Dr.'s note says I was having a depressive episode, but I'm unable to think back to this period at all. Its not really a foggy feeling, but a genuine detachment from the past. It's like with each new episode I have, I'm molting out my old skin and now I'm an entirely different person. It is as if the person described in the after visit summary isn't me at all... It's honestly kind of scary.

"Shifting the focus of treatment to a more spiritual goal: zen, Taoism, non dual? I am doing all the normal things to try to treat my bipolar. Medicine and therapy. Building better structure and habits. Mindfulness.

However, my bipolar has also led me down the rabbit hole of Taoism, Zen Buddhism, and non duality.

I have the thought that my bipolar is a mental illness, which primarily takes place in my thoughts and emotions. The disciplines above emphasize the importance of letting go of your thoughts and emotions to become more present. 

I will not abandon my medicine and therapy, however, I am considering shifting my goals of healing a little bit. 

Until now, my goal has been to become a well functioning member of society who is able independently support myself in a way that is healthy and fulfilling to me. This has been my goal for the past 2 years, since my major depressive episode ruined my life and left me completely dependent on my family. 

I‚Äôve made a lot of progress towards this goal, but I‚Äôm not nearly independent or even functional yet. And it often feels like I might never be.

It feels like healing from my bipolar has been a constant uphill battle, and I‚Äôm tired of fighting it. Recently, I‚Äôve felt myself slipping into another depression, and I suspect it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm losing my will to fight. 

So now I‚Äôm considering letting go of my goal, even though my goal seems very normal, healthy, and wholesome. And replacing it with a devotion to a spiritual practice. The practice I am most drawn to is a non dual meditation where you focus your attention on actually experiencing your sensations. 

Has anyone tried anything like this? What has been your experience if so. Am I crazy for considering shifting my goal from being a functioning independent member of society who is able to support myself in a way that is healthy and fulfilling? Is this a bad idea. Like I said, I will not quit therapy and medicine, just shift my goals and focus a little. ",bipolar

"Turned to THC for mild anxiety relief at 36. Psychosis followed. Life feels over Hello friends. 

  
I got out of the hospital about a month ago after weed sent me into psychosis for the first time in my life.  I went from being a normal, successful dad - respected at work and with friends and family to nearly killing myself by walking into traffic and permanently damaging my eyes from staring at the sun. 

I had no idea bipolar was even a possibility for me. It started out just casually trying to wind down after a stressful day at work. It had just become legal not too long ago and I wanted to see what all of the fuss was about. I found that weed helped me be more patient with my kids and put me more in the present moment. 

  
So I started doing it daily after I'd get off. It happened slowly - I was spending a lot of time meditating and practicing spirituality when suddenly I felt as though I was undergoing a spiritual awakening. I started hearing voices that I thought were angels in my head that were telling me how special I was and I was going to help the world.

I then became obsessed with Plato's cave and became convinced we were supposed to be able to look at the sun and we've all been living in a metaphorical and literal cave. The next thing I knew, I was driving west until my car ran out of gas, and started walking into oncoming traffic thinking I was leading the second coming of Christ. 

Now weeks later I'm trying to pick up the pieces. The eye doctor told me I have permanent damage to my retinas, I can barely get through the day because of massive bouts of depression and panic attacks. Risperidone makes me feel like death. I am useless at work and at home with my kids and with my wife. I have to wait weeks to see a doctor that knows how to treat bipolar. 

I'm just having a horrible time. I feel as if I'm spending my entire day just trying to get to the part where I can go to sleep and not think about any of this. I just can't believe I behaved the way that I did and how I possibly could have thought staring at the sun was a good idea. I can't believe I almost killed myself when I was living a relatively normal life just a few months ago.

"Yes, it is I've been seeing some posts here asking ""is it possible to be/become"".

To all of you (I imagine younger ones) asking if it is possible to achieve something when you have bipolar. YES IT IS.

But it is going to be harder than if it wasn't the case, but here's the thing, a lot of things could make it even harder.

Here's some advice:
1-NOTHING is impossible due to bipolar. This journey is MUCH less of a if and more of a ""how hard will it be?""

2-Don't compare yourself with random people. This is usually a good advice for everyone, but when we have bipolar, is good to take extra care with some bad behaviors that are bad for our mental health. Comparing will always have a negative outcome because people only show their good side, and even so usually lying.
There's no ""correct time to do stuff"", do your own way at your own pace.

3-Research about your specific situation. 
Are you bipolar and have adhd(for example)? Then learn about bipolar, adhd, their interactions, HOW it can impact your (relationship, work, study, etc)

4-DONT skip therapy, DONT skip your meds

5-Don't be afraid to experiment.Try different courses majors. I dropped out of college 3 times, in 2017 I dropped out of psychology after one single class. For awhile I was putting myself down thinking I failed multiple times, but then I realized that I haven't failed, I was experimenting, and this made me a much more knowledgeable person.

6-And finally the biggest advice in only two words: baby steps! 
No matter how complex is the objective, you always start with one step, so don't skip steps or try to take multiple at once. Remember baby steps, one step at a time.

After all that, remember, we are here to help and be helped, so ask if you need any help! And remember you can do anything you set your mind to.",bipolar

At first, I felt as though I was drugged and felt sluggish on my meds.

Advice?",bipolar
"Advice on loved ones leaving because of bipolar disorder? I was recently hospitalized for a severe depressive episode with psychotic features. The week beforehand I was having pretty intense suicidal ideation and it was consuming my every thought. I reached out to my now ex boyfriend one night, asking him to come over to keep me company because I felt unsafe being alone. He laid in bed with me for about an hour, and then stood up and said ‚Äúyour bipolar is too much for me, I can‚Äôt continue this relationship.‚Äù He broke up with me, left my apartment and I haven‚Äôt seen him since. I went to the hospital a few days later and was there for eight days. When I got out, I texted my two best friends that I had gotten home. The response by one of them was probably the most mean spirited text I‚Äôve ever received. He explained to me that I had been talking too much about my issues and that he did not want to talk to me anymore for at least the near future. I texted my other friend who I have known since we were seven years old, asking her how she felt about what he said. To my surprise she said she completely agreed with him. They both refuse to talk to me now, and I‚Äôm stuck in this loop of confusion, sadness and anger. Has anyone else had loved ones just simply leave your life because you went into crisis? And if so, how do you go about coping? I‚Äôve lost three people who I would‚Äôve taken a bullet for. I fortunately have a supportive family and two other friends who have been getting me through this, but it has been an extremely difficult process.

"Need some guidance Hello all, I have never posted here but I am at a very low point currently. My bipolar has never been as bad as right now. I was pretty manic a few weeks back when I got an offer to leave my stable, boring job & step into a pre apprenticeship for something I have always wanted to do. As the last couple weeks went by I noticed my mood dropping, and up to yesterday I was in a complete fog, confused & rushed all the time, anxious, and unbelievably depressed every night. I wake myself up 3 hours early because of how difficult it is to get out of bed 

My boss has now told me to take a day off to work through my mental health with my doctor because even he noticed I was completely off the last couple days.

Guys, I absolutely love this career and I am terrified that I will not be better enough to keep it. I keep getting reassured that it's not permanent and he'll keep space for me, but my brain is screaming the opposite at me.

I feel very giddy and like my heads in a tennis match, swinging between toxic positivity and then an urge to react toxically myself. 

I don't know if I'm looking for a different perspective or just techniques to ground me. 

It's frustrating because it feels good compared to the low mood I've had for ages now. So it's almost like that extra layer of temptation to lean into it. But I can almost guarantee if I just follow this energy and don't ground myself, this will start a hypomanic episode.

"Healthcare in your country Healthcare isn't free and i was curious to know how you manage in your country having a chronic illness.


I'm from France and basically, we have a universal healthcare covering part of the fees (the part covered depends on the type of care, teeth for example are badly covered) and to be completed by your own private insurance. 
We also have a measure called ALD, affection de longue dur√©e, meaning long-term illness. It covers all your fees 100% needed to take care of this illness. I have an ALD for my bipolar disorders and i never have to pay for anything (meds, doctors ...).
There are also free group psychotherapy at the hospital.
Unfortunately, the universal healthcare don't cover all therapist, only a few and you most of the time have to fund everything by yourself - with the help of your private insurance.

With our beloved president Emmanuel Macron and his right wing government, the parts covered by the universal healthcare are under attacked and planned to get lower and lower.
They're also questioning the ALD and thinking about lowering the list of diseases that can open this right (or why not suppress it entirely).
Something i'm not affected by but that's still making me mad is that they also want to put the AME under attack. AME, aide m√©dical d'√©tat = state medical aid, is a measure that people with ""no papers"", illegaly on the territory, can use to still access basic healthcare. They're thinking about deleting it and, basically, let people die.

How is it like in your country ? I feel like more and more countries, at least in the west, are tending more and more (far) right. This does affect the access to healthcare in a very negative ways. As people with a chronic illness, how do you live through that ?

I swear i've been through a fucking trip

I've been having obvious symptoms of bipolar disorder for around 5-6 years now.

I have recently started seeing an ACTUAL bipolar specialist, and today she told me ""Its honestly quite straightforward, bipolar type 1, im not sure where all the confusion even came from""

**FCKING FINALLY**

I have now been through 17 shitty hospital stays, 5+ full blown manic episodes, almost offing myself at one point, and suffering for no reason for so long, and want to know the reason?

Because doctors in all their knowledge and smart-assery, ""couldnt"" figure out whats wrong with me, and blamed everything on a BPD diagnosis I got, and never even had, because surely an LGBT woman cant possibly have a mood disorder, forcing me to live a living hell, unmedicated for years, because in my lovely country if you have BPD meds are a big no no, it took a psychotic manic episode to finally light some fucking lightbulbs in their heads and I've been okay since (this was like 2022) but ""mmmm well we dont know if ur bipolar ;(""

Yeah, honestly?

After years of that, losing my ""best years"" to mental illness, developing anorexia to cope, being traumatised by a psych once, and being told over and over that ""therapy will help"" (it didnt), being told to fuck off during a manic episode in a psych ward because ""i just have severe BPD"".......

Maybe I can finally breathe, it feels good that for once in my god-forsaken life I have a doctor, a hella qualified one, FINALLY say i havent been making this shit up all along

Oh and she's funny, all this ambiguity over my mental health caused my list of issues to be a mess, and she's like ""oh well seems BP2 is in there, well let me change that and add a ""lot"" of notes... Good luck arguing against this one""

Now Im here, I just talked to one of the most qualified people in my country about this for weeks;

Now no one... Finally, no one, can possibly be stupid enough to argue that Im not bipolar, I've been repeating myself over and over for so long and... I mean imagine having the balls to argue against a team working for a hospital specialising in bipolar disorder lol

**FUCK ME IT FEELS GOOD MAN....**

I just wish it didnt take so long....

Now just gotta get that shitty BPD stigma bullshit removed and I'll finally feel free, tho that obviously will be its own story, but what this doctor said sounds about right, ""if symptoms of BPD are only present when you have an episode... there is probably a lot to talk about"" and yeah, thats basically the case so

"Someone to listen  Trigger warning - mention of SH and suicide 

I just need to rant to likeminded people who understand bipolar.

I (32f) have been with my partner (35m) for 16 years. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety around 2014, have been a SHer since 2004, and diagnosed with Bipolar and PTSD (childhood SA) in 2020. 

Last year around September, I thought I was fine and went off all meds, which landed me a 4 week stay in a psychiatric hospital over Christmas. I feel like I'm doing better now. I see a psychologist every 3-4 weeks, psychiatrist every 2 months, and doing an outpatient program at the psychiatric hospital for the next 3 months.

My partner is a cop and a problem solver, and doesn't understand mental illness well. Since my hospital stay, he's been picking up when I'm going down hill again pretty good (ie I don't clean the house, don't shower, don't go to sleep til around 6am).

Today he hit me with the 'I need to talk' and long story short, these are what stuck with me.
‚óè he's been trying to bring this up the past couple of weeks
‚óè mentioned he's been waiting to see if I 'get better'
‚óè said he keeps thinking about what wouldve happened if I'd killed myself and he found my body
‚óè said its hard that he stresses if he left my meds out and what i could do with them and he goes to jobs at work like me
‚óè questions whether we are just together because it's all we know, as that's how he feels
‚óè said that me not remembering having sex is a big problem, after I told him the antipsychotics I take to sleep is the cause of that.

This man is 1 in a million, he has done more for me (emotionally, financially) than I'm worth.

"Daily life  Hello type 2 here 

Im 41F. 4 years ago I developed a deep depression which was diagnosed as such. About a year later due to some life stories my psychiatrist identified as hypomania she changed her diagnosis to Bipolar. Also, I had no improvements on antidepressants but found some stability with a mood stabiliser prescribed by my neurologist for migraine.

I think I was hyperthimic my whole adult life, a great feeling which I deeply miss. Ive never experienced mania, only hypomania. I‚Äôve been on medication for three years and only recently I feel less depressed. However, life is uneventful, no excitement. Sometimes I feel hyped up, don‚Äôt want to sleep and get lots of ideas I obsessively think about, mainly projects, business or creativity.

I miss my old life but I fear that without medication things could eventually get worse

My parents are divorced and since their marriage it was nothing but a destructive relationship, they didn't have time for their children and I never had any close friends or family to the point I basically can't socialise to most people and im always anxious ; which made me always seek support from online friends, etc.. it became so bad that when I was 10, I saw my dad choking my mom after an argument I tried to kill myself from the depression afterwards from that scene and nobody cared, ""just a child playing"". 

Fast forward after their divorce, they still arguing about where my brother should go to college and other stuff including screaming shouting so it didn't really matter that they got divorced, it was basically the same for me.


I had times where I would sleep and never get out of bed for weeks, and times where I'd just do crazy stuff I'd barely sleep ,I'd talk quickly, my mind will be filled with thoughts and ideas and one day I booked an online meeting with a psychiatrist I even payed behind my parents back. When he ""diagnosed"" me with bipolar I thought he was crazy that he's a fake etc. And now looking back at it he might be right.

For the past month or so, I've been very irritable my mom would cry every night trying to guilt trip me; saying I'm not like her child 2 years ago that I'm different that I'm bad and that I'm the worst son she could ever ask for.

 last week, I posted nudes of myself because my self esteem was through the roof and I thought everyone would like my body and would fantasise about having sexual relations with me. Looking back at it, the psychiatrist might've been right. I tried many times to bring myself to ask my parents to see a professional but I just can't it's like my tongue is tied and I've been just trying so hard to survive in this empty life and just came to the conclusion that

I'm just a sick helpless pathetic child. I hope my death arrives soon instead of me causing it.

Sorry because this is long I just wanted to vent üòî. ",bipolar
"can people have a successful career with bpd or bipolar 1/2. Idk how to frame this without sounding rude. I often find myself asking this question. I am very ambitious as a person and want to be a doctor preferably a psychiatrist or a surgeon. But i feel like i would be dead by the time i reach there it's so fucking hard dealing with this, like no one fucking gets what you r going through either they label u crazy or just an attention seeker. It's a long ass journey. 

I got into med school but i feel like if i hadn't have to deal with this disorder or the people around me were more considerate or supporting i would have made it in a shorter period of time. Getting into med school was hard in itself i am shit scared what med school will do to me. Especially given my unstable mental health.

"I was about to get kicked about my dormitory due to my episode Hello, 19F here. I was diagnosed with bipolar in June. 

So l am having a depressive episode right now and noticed it 2 days ago when I realised I was smoking/drinking too much, constantly tired and generally extremely unmotivated to the point where I cannot function well. I was prescribed with wellbutrin and quetiapine. 

The thing is due to my lack of energy, I have been extremely unhygienic. My desk is a mess and I haven't taken a shower in 10 days. So they told the dorm administrator about these and she called me. She told me to take care of my hygiene or leave the dorm. I told her about my bipolar and then she said she understood me. 

The thing I am mad about is that they could have talked to me before reporting me to the administrator. The lack of basic hygiene is a major symptom of depression. I could have noticed my episode earlier if they talked to me.",bipolar
"Could my anxiety-induced depression be related to bipolar disorder? My psychiatrist has been flip flopping between a vague ""mood disorder"" and Bipolar II diagnoses for me, which has been really confusing especially when dealing with my ""mood fluctuations."" I have experienced things that resemble hypomania and definitely have depressive episodes, but I generally am emotionally all over the place and have a hard time with understanding what exactly it is that I'm feeling (which is probably why I'm struggling to get a clear diagnoses). 

However, the most consistent/predictable pattern that I've seen in myself for years now is that when I have a severe amount of anxiety, I will 100% get depressed right after. After my anxiety washes away, I'm left feeling like a husk. The more severe my anxiety is, the worse my depression is after. I always chalked it up to be some chemical imbalance I had in my brain, but now I'm wondering if this could be related to my ""mood disorder.""

Has anyone experienced something similar to this?",bipolar

"just got diagnosed today (BP2), I need advice on how to prepare to live now I talked with my psychiatrist today, after having my first hypomanic episode last week. for reference i‚Äôm 20f and before this i was diagnosed with bpd, autism, adhd, anxiety and depression. my family has many many people with bipolar so i guess i knew it was a possibility but i never experienced hypomania until now. it was mild, but still scary. i have been on a mood stabilizer most of my life for bpd, so i think that helped somehow. but my psychiatrist said i am at the age where it comes to full effect. I have been trying to research how this disorder works, what to expect. but i guess im still lost. i‚Äôm scared about what will happen down the line, do episodes get more severe? does it work like that?? my father who i do not speak to nor have ever met, had bipolar and ruined our family to the worst degree. it started off mild for him, and ended up ruining his life. 

i guess the pro is that i caught it early, my medication is being increased and i will try to not let it get worse. I‚Äôm not going to let it ruin my plans or future but with bipolar you can‚Äôt choose to have mania and you can‚Äôt be fixed. a lot is out of your control. during my first episode, i saw bugs, shadows, i felt paranoid, terrified of going outside, felt my skin crawl, spent more money than i had on hobbies i was convinced would bring me success, didn‚Äôt sleep till 7 am. during the episode i didn‚Äôt really gage what was happening, but i knew i felt different.

 I was excited and unstoppable and then fell into the worst depression i‚Äôve ever had. when someone has an episode like this, do the episodes stay the same, is there any sense of reliability in this and what i can expect, or when it happens next is it luck of the draw?

 I am scared, please tell me what happened after your first episode. how did it change for you, did it progress or stay the same? did you get more comfortable as more of them occurred? ",bipolar

"I'm ashamed Ugh. A little drunk. I'm feeling... Lost.
 I can't help being bipolar. I don't want to be anything but me. But I still can't figure out how much of it was my fault. The last relationship I had was abusive as hell. She cut me, she did so many things to me. And I don't know how much I consented to and I didn't because I was so disconnected for so much of it.
 Would it be different if my brain was different? I don't know why my current girlfriend loves me. I'm just a lost manic depressive. I'm still craving love as much as I am ecstasy. It's so painful. 
I'm awed by how loving she is. It can just be so painful to be lucid. I don't want to go off my meds and I won't, ever. But I'm so scared of the stability. Being out of control feels freeing. I don't feel like I have the leeway to be myself. I don't know who I am on or off medication. So much has changed. I'm different. Physically and mentally. It's so messy. I feel bad about myself for being bipolar, for hearing voices, for doing dangerous shit when I was manic. But being stable feels awful too. It's better, but awful in its own way. I'm sad. I don't know if the disorder was my own fault. I don't know how much of my trauma was my own fault. I don't know why she loves me. I hope I'm good enough for her. I feel broken. I don't feel worthy of this woman who has been so healing for me. Am I just broken? Is something wrong with me? Why is being bipolar so confusing? I need more help. I can't think straight, ever. I feel ugly inside. I feel so broken in a way that can't be fixed because whether I like it or not my brain chemistry is chemically and genetically broken. Am I doomed to suffer forever? Is it my fault? Am I ugly inside?",bipolar

"How do I get over my fear of driving? I haven‚Äôt driven properly since my manic episode in early 2022 (very dangerous I know, I was undiagnosed bipolar at the time).

I‚Äôve probably driven under 10 times since that, and I feel terrible for my partner who has to drive myself and our daughter around.

The thing is I can‚Äôt stop associating being behind the wheel with being manic.

I‚Äôve been stable since being medicated and coming out of depression mid/late 2022, but the fear of driving has still stuck with me.

I am also autistic so for me personally, driving is sensory hell and too much for my brain, and I have had general fear around driving and being in a car since I was young (having been in car accidents)

How do I overcome this fear? Is it okay for me to just not drive?

Thanks in advance!",bipolar

"Is this my bipolar or something g else?  For about the last maybe 1-2 weeks I have been feeling so insecure and crying a lot and I cannot get out of my own head. It‚Äôs causing me to not eat well (but then sometimes binge) and not sleep well. 

I‚Äôve been looking for extra reassurance in my relationship and I‚Äôve never done that before. I‚Äôve been almost lashing out when I feel insecure or ‚Äúaccusing‚Äù him of things that I know in my heart are not true. It almost feels like self sabotage behavior. But tonight I caught myself having all these thoughts of low self worth and insecurities then not but a moment later thinking all these kind things about myself and reminding myself that my partner does love me. It was light night and day, a switch flipped and I went from internally being so hatful to myself to rationalizing with reality. 


As I‚Äôve told my partner, I know this is a ‚ÄúME‚Äù issue I need to address and fix. So I‚Äôm not sure if this is bipolar related or something else? My psy did up my mood stabilizer last month and Oct is always a hard time of year for me with past trauma. Not sure if these play into it too? ",bipolar
"I miss my boyfriend I feel like such a clingy bitch right now.

My boyfriend has other important things to do this week, at least Monday-Wednesday. So I haven't been able to see him.


And its making me so angry and sad at the same time. I'm currently pacing my room saying that it's healthy for him to have a life outside of me. I'm so glad he's bettering himself with school and hanging out with friends. I want him to have a life outside of me.


But alas my brain is broken and my abandonment issues are coming full force. He deserves someone unbroken, someone who doesn't have melt downs over small stuff.
I can't wait to have insurance so I can have a therapist again.

For now, I use reddit to rant, and this group has been so incredibly helpful. I just wish I could unswitch the brokenness that is my mind. 

Like I went from an LDR with a partner who never wanted to call me never mind see me, to a person who wants to see me everyday (even when he can't) and wants to talk to me and support me.

Yet I'm upset that I can't see him for three days?? I'm going to scare him away. He says I'm not. That he will be patient and he loves me. But I've heard this from many people who claimed to love me and they all left.


I just wish I could just shut off this switch of over feeling. Logically I know he loves me, and unfortunately his schedule is just busy this week.

But I miss him, I don't like sleeping without him. I'm constantly scared I'm going to scare him away. And how do I even communicate all this, without making him feel guilty. 

My brain hurts. It's 1AM and I'm just pacing. I'm worried and scared.

I just want a functional brain. Not one that rips and dissects every minor thought I've had.

Some of them were successful academics and the heads of the department where I studied. They also complained about me, but I apologized to them and explained that I was diagnosed with BPD.

"So I‚Äôve admitted myself tonight. I‚Äôm in Norway and I had the worst depression/anxiety/ocd attack today. I was terrified of snapping and killing my parents and my cat (harm OCD) and I had to admitt myself. I have bipolar disorder and intrusive thoughts-ocd, and possibly be having a mixed episode. 

It is a very modern, big building and I had a good talk around midnight (right after my arrival) with a doctor, a nurse and a social worker that were so kind. They gave me some sleeping and anxiety meds and let me have my phone and even my airpods, which felt sightly nice. 

My room is quite nice and rn I feel pretty safe. Tomorrow we will discuss further treatment, ECT has been mentioned. 

I can‚Äôt speak for psychiatric hospitals everywhere, but if you‚Äôre in Norway you have nothing to be scared of.

So a little victory that I‚Äôm here, feel safe and are comfortable. 

Thought  i should share some photos of how my room looks in Norway, psychiatry is part of our free healthcare so all this costs nothing for a patient.",bipolar

"The worst part about bipolar that nobody talks about The worst part is not the mood swings or the violent intrusive thoughts that make Saw look like a romantic comedy. It is not the hypersexuality or the inability to sleep or the reckless behaviour. It is not even the suicidal and self-destructive urges that tell you that it's all hopeless so just give up.

The worst part is never truly knowing who you are. I look back at myself (text messages, Facebook messages, memories if I have any) when I was in an episode (depressive or manic) and I literally don't recognise that person. I find myself saying ""Am I really like that? Who is that person?""

Combine that with the dissociation (not being in my own body for the majority of the time) and I don't feel like I know myself or ever will. Does anyone else get this or is it just me?",bipolar

"Today after having no fixed address for over a year, I moved into my new home ü•πüíú I separated from my ex in October of last year after having gone completely off the rails with my bipolar for 18 months. Needless to say, the fall out was brutal. I left my home that night, wasn‚Äôt working and had nothing to my name. In the last year, I‚Äôve lived in a cousins box bedroom, my parents, my uncles and of course, the hospital for a period. I fell into debt and lost two jobs to redundancy‚Ä¶pushing me further into debt.
In November of last year, I tried to take my life. I was in a coma for 3.5 days. If you‚Äôd have told me then how much can change in a year, I wouldn‚Äôt have listened.
Today, I have a job that I love, my family and I are closer than ever, I‚Äôve learnt how to love myself, be alone and not lonely, and heal. There are still things to work on, and still bad days.

"Things I wish I'd known about bipolar I wrote this up to process my experiences this year with the thought of maybe sharing it online. I already bugged everyone on facebook about what I was going through when I was going through it though, so maybe not. I thought I'd post it here anyway. Maybe it's helpful to some people.

**Mania feels like enlightenment**

Mania brought out huge emotions that I never knew were in me. I felt deep feelings of love some days, anger others and an all-over general disregard for consequences. It doesn‚Äôt matter what I did, I felt validated.

The thoughts I had were all-important. I had a right to whatever good thing life threw at me and I was convinced I could get along with everyone and if I couldn‚Äôt, well it was their fault.

Having such a big shift in your thought feels spiritually important when you‚Äôre in it. I‚Äôm not the only person who's suddenly found their spiritual side out of nowhere.

You see madness coming as you approach it and then suddenly, *wham*, you‚Äôre Neo and you have to save the world. This is different, you‚Äôre not mad, you have purpose. Life isn‚Äôt a confusing march to death after all!

**Depression taught me there isn‚Äôt a *real* me**

I thought I was someone who enjoyed exercise, but one day my body felt heavy and I couldn‚Äôt go to the gym any more. I thought I was someone who was intelligent, but one day my brain was like treacle and I couldn‚Äôt do my job. I thought I was someone with a sense of humour, but one day I couldn‚Äôt even come up with words. I thought I was someone with friends and family who I loved, but then I trusted no-one.

You get back to this blank state of nihilistic solipsism and have to rebuild one block at a time.

**Normality is the bit that feels unstable**

I‚Äôm fairly convinced most people go through life feeling a little bit fragile and unsure of themselves. They know an unkind word could send them into a pit or a kind word in the right place could make them feel on top of the world.

A mood disorder is the negation of all of that. You feel one way. Manic, it doesn‚Äôt matter what someone says to you, you are on a mission. Of course they‚Äôre telling you you‚Äôre crazy, you‚Äôre doing something no-one has done before. People thought every great person was crazy. But soon you‚Äôll prove them all wrong.

People humour me when I‚Äôm depressed. Or if they‚Äôre not humouring me it‚Äôs only because they don‚Äôt know my deep, terrible secrets. And they‚Äôre all terrible too. I'll remember every little thing they ever said or did to me. They feel obligated to me as a friend, of course, but I know they‚Äôd rather be with anyone else.

**Mood swings make me dumb**

I like to think I‚Äôm reasonably intelligent, but trying to do my job whilst going through a depressive episode was hopeless. I had a system where I‚Äôd have evernote open and write timestamped notes as I was working. I‚Äôd lose focus every minute and have to look at the list of things I‚Äôd been doing. Even then my brain was like treacle.

And amnesia is a huge side-effect too. At the deepest depression, your entire mental vision is filled with your regrets. You can‚Äôt remember the joy you felt on your childhood holidays or even what you were doing that morning.

Strangely, you can remember everything negative. Not just about you either, about everybody.

I hope I never take my life, but knowing I get to a place where I'm retarded; can‚Äôt remember anything positive; where my body feels heavy and I feel generally like a worthless, unattached piece of shit with no sense of identity scares me. It‚Äôs not a game. I know what I value about my life now, but when I‚Äôm in that pit, those memories aren‚Äôt available to me any more.

**You have to learn trust**

Losing touch with reality and having a brain that didn‚Äôt work meant I had to trust other people to think for me. Whether it was nurses, doctors, family or friends. I have been severely retarded for months this year and I am infinitely grateful to everyone who put up with that.

You can‚Äôt judge how mad you are yourself. Your brain‚Äôs entire internal logic changes. All the time you‚Äôll feel like whatever you‚Äôre doing is the most natural thing in the world. I have done bizarre stuff, but it all seemed normal, at the time.

There‚Äôs a point when you have to toss your life‚Äôs keys to someone else if you want to be safe.

**Apologies are complex**

Do you apologise for what you said manic?

Do you apologise for being bad at your job depressed?

Do you apologise for making inappropriate advances, losing your cool, getting in fights?

Do you apologise for not answering calls, not tidying up after yourself, being surly?

Do you apologise knowing that if people can‚Äôt put up with you being unreliable sometimes, you‚Äôre going to have to apologise again and again?

It‚Äôs fair to say I regret a huge portion of my life. There are people I‚Äôm probably never going to talk to again. And all through the episodes, it‚Äôs still me, but what do I do with that? I know what I did, I know why I upset people. And I know I‚Äôll probably do similarly stupid things again.

**Mental illness is fundamentally lonely**

At a certain point in mania, I got frustrated that no-one thought I was telepathic like I knew I was and depression told me that no-one out there cared or understood. In deepest depression I can‚Äôt even vocalise what I‚Äôm feeling, so what use is a hotline?

It was actually helpful to be sectioned whilst manic. Being around other people who were uncertain about the nature of reality was somewhat comforting.",bipolar

"My dad just died from bipolar (TW suicide/addiction/drug mention) if post is not okay I'll remove it.

Yesterday afternoon I got a call from the police. My dad has been found dead in his bed after the neighbors called them because of the smell. He was only 59.

I haven't seen my dad in three years, we went low contact. He had bipolar, I inherited it. My parents separated because he struggled too much with his illness and became violent. He was not a good father, I won't go into details but he just ... wasn't made to be a dad. 

He struggled with addiction. What started from alcohol grew quickly into cocaine then into Xanax. He would call me for help, I'd go to the hospital with him, I'd stay with him, I'd make sure he was doing okay in rehab. Then he would be good for a while before going down again. He never got to really stabilize his bipolar, he didn't really want to. He would always say ''I don't have bipolar anymore''. I have accepted that nothing would have made him okay, he just needed to live his life like he wished for.

They found a ton of meds beside his body, they don't even know yet if it's a suicide. I know it's one. He tried too many times, and I just wasn't there anymore this time. I had blocked him three weeks ago, because I was in a down phase and I feared to be really vile to him. The only time I block him, he dies. 

All my dad has been doing this past twenty years is talk about the past. How a good man he was. How he missed that. I wish I'd remember any of that but I don't. I don't know how and when his bipolar took him. I just remember him hitting my mom, drinking, falling all the time from overdose. But somehow I am not angry anymore. Not today.

I want to send this message to anyone with bipolar, me included : taking ur meds is okay, seeking help is okay, being weak is okay.",bipolar

"(hypo)mania and depression aren't just intense versions of happiness and sadness, they're entirely different states of mind I started Lamictal a couple months ago and things have been getting a lot better for me; I'm a lot more stable. 


A couple days ago I learned that my grandma is getting pretty sick and that there isn't a whole lot that anyone can do. Obviously we can't visit because of COVID. So it's a sad time. (She's had a long and good life. I've been lucky to have her in my life. It's natural and everyone eventually dies, but it's still sad, you know?)


Anyway, at the risk of sounding like I have a heart of stone, the sadness I feel about the situation with my grandma is a lot easier to deal with than depressive episodes. It's an emotional reaction to an event. I'm sad, but I'm still myself. 


Depressive episodes are *nothing* like this sadness. During those episodes it feels like black tar is oozing through my veins instead of blood. I've never felt happiness before and I never will. Everything is dark and there isn't an escape. 


Then when the pendulum swings the other way it feels like my body is on vibrate, but *just* fast enough to be at a high-pitched hum. It's like I'm watching the part of my favorite movie that comes *right before* the climax but the climax never comes. I *want* to do everything but if I sit down to do anything I'll explode.


Normal happiness? Nothing like that.


It seems like happiness and sadness are *reactions*. They're the effect, not the cause. Depression and mania are the opposite for me. They occur by themselves and affect other parts of my life. I'm not feeling happy because I'm listening to a good song, I'm playing the first 10 seconds of 15 different songs because I'm looking for a way to externalize the intense energy I'm feeling. 


Happiness and sadness change the way I feel, but depression and mania change the way I see.",bipolar

"My semester GPA is 4.00! My hands are shaking and I am in complete disbelief. I had been diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar disorder I prior to starting college. I struggled with the med changes and was really unmotivated. 

After I had a breakdown because of not being able to focus on the exam, my meds finally started to work together. 

My mood stabilizers made it really hard for me to adjust the stimulant dosage and I developed a pill taking phobia but I am finally stable.

I don't have many people around me to celebrate my GPA because of my destructive manic episodes and I know it isn'y much since it is only semester GPA but I feel proud of myself.

"I killed a man while experiencing a mental health crisis A few years ago, I killed a man while experiencing severe psychosis. I went to a hospital and was involuntarily committed. But, I didn't have any health insurance at the time, and the hospital released me without stabilizing me. I was basically kicked out within 4 days and my condition worsened over the next couple of weeks. I drove to a different state while experiencing severe psychosis and encountered an innocent man at his place of work and killed him. This fact weighs on me very heavily. I was found Not Guilty by the Reason of Insanity and was committed to a state hospital. They provided intense treatment for years and I was released into the community about a year ago. I should add, the incident was my only mental health crisis and I have lived a happy n healthy life otherwise. I'm adjusting to being back out in the community, but sometimes it is hard. My mental health is in good shape and I'm doing everything to maintain it. But, dating is particularly hard and tricky at times. I don't want to be viewed as someone to be afraid of, but it is part of my reality and I must contend with it. It is all just very unfortunate and I think about my victim often and think about the care I didn't get. I feel like myself, but the world views me differently and it sucks. I do have incredible support system and all my family and friends have stuck by me. I have also made some incredible friends while in the system. I wish we would talk more about mental health and not stigmatized it so much. Please take care of yourself and I'm here if you need to talk or vent.",bipolar

"Being told I'm high functioning is not comforting My therapist likes to tell me about famous bipolar people and other patients of hers that are so much worse off than me. It makes it feel like she and no else understands how fucking hard it is to drive to work in a depressive episode without purposefully crashing my car or to not quit my job in a manic episode and go live in a treehouse with a harem of strange men selling drugs for a living. I'm grateful that even at my worst with psychosis, I'm still of sound enough mind to not do that stuff as much as I convince myself that's the only way to be happy and be myself, but it's STILL not comforting to hear that those thought patterns ""aren't that bad"".  

Just a small rant I had to get out. Shout out to my fellow high functionals.

EDIT TO ADD thanks for sharing all your own experiences. My therapist absolutely does not say things like this maliciously, it's just a thing I think a lot of people thinks sounds comforting. Imagine saying ""Think of how lucky you are! It could be so much worse!"" to someone who just lost a toe to diabetes. Of course they're glad they didn't lose a whole leg, but it also sucks a lot to lose a toe. Inner peace is my lost toe. Anyway, this therapist doesn't know much about bipolar, so I am going back to the drawing board in the near future to find someone I relate to a little more as far as the darker goings on in my head.

"Psychosis is the scariest part of this disorder  I know not everyone with bipolar will experience psychosis, but I think those who have will agree it is terrifying. I slipped into mania gradually, then it turned into psychosis during my first ever mania episode. I believed crazy things that had no basis in reality, I even developed delusions about my loved ones which I am sad about. I would hear whispering and screaming and I couldn‚Äôt trust what was real and what wasn‚Äôt anymore. I would see scary faces and dark shadows, I would hallucinate animals too. I even experienced olfactory hallucinations, at one point I thought I could smell a gas leak and my mother said she couldn‚Äôt smell anything and it was fine, but I was so worried I called a gas company up and they came and knew I was crazy lol. 

It is so scary to completely lose touch with reality and have to second guess yourself all the time. I hope I never get to that place again.

I am perfectly stable and need nothing from her other than to be a roommate but she still views me as a danger and a liability-simply because of my diagnosis. 

She accused me of taking a shower in her bathroom and writing ‚Äúfuck‚Äù on the mirror. My mom thinks she did it herself to make me seem more dangerous and give credit to her prejudiced fears about me. 

I‚Äôm so heartbroken for being judged like this. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll trust people again. I certainly don‚Äôt trust her. I‚Äôm scared of her accusing me of more random shit. 

She told me we were the same, both broken trust and scared of each other. The difference is her feelings are based on prejudice ideas about bipolar people and mine are based on her actual actions. 

She tried to make me move out, I had to explain that that was bullshit and if she has a problem she‚Äôs going to have to break the lease herself. 

I‚Äôm so sad. I was finally getting my feet under me and now I feel unsafe and scared in my home and uncertain about the future. What a cruel, cruel person. And she thought she was in the right! What a fucked up world we live in.
