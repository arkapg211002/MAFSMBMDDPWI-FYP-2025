"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",depression
"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",depression
"PLEASE STOP telling people that all they need to do is 'talk' or 'reach out' just stop lol 

do you know how many dicks are out there? do you know how many people that ones suffering do reach out to & speak up about their struggles are not capable, educated or have the empathy required to actually help? 9/10, they going to down play you, or put you down, or shut you off, or make fun of you or tell you that other people have way worse than you etc 

just stop telling, advertising, sharing, yelling & just offering a shitty answer that has no follow up, & makes them somehow feel like they are actually 'helping' or offering 'advice' like seriously, stoppppp ittttttt

unless they are educated, tolerant, empathic & have the training & resources behind them, stop telling me to just vomit their feelings to anyone, & somehow, it will 'help' 

it won't, 9/10, it will do more damage, so stop it, until you have serious follow-up prepared for the statements you are making to those struggling! 

sorry for the rant, but needed that out!",depression
"“It made you stronger” I was told this the other day at a meeting with like a mental health professional person and it really pissed me off!

No it didn’t make stronger at all. It made me extremely anxious and a person who walks on eggshells all the time. It made me a people pleaser who doesn’t set boundaries. It made me doubt myself. It killed something inside me.

I didn’t deserve it. I didn’t want or ask to be stronger!

So no it did not make me stronger. It made me weak and fragile and afraid!

Im so tired Ive been having mental breakdowns lately. Ive been burned out from work for the last year and now my relationship is turning sour. Im also in debt and pretty sure no one will notice that im gone. I cant believe that i just told myself that i wanna die already. What is wrong with me? Truth is i dont really want to die and would like to live a happy life but i dont where and how to start,depression
"Why the fuck should i suffer all this I am 14 and I have two very loving parents and a brother, This thought has been with me for a while now of time passing too quickly and before I knew it boom my parents were already 40 and 50 and my brother was 18, IT PASSED TOO QUICK. I thought about this and asked other adults if they felt the same, and they said yes, they feel time passed too quickly now they don't have any purpose but to provide for their kids (Who are going to suffer the same thing)Everything triggers nostalgia in me and knowing that those days won't come back and ill get older in a flash I DONT WANT TO FUCKING LIVE ANYMORE",depression
"Got blackout drunk at school So apparently in order to get someone to notice is to drink half a liter of vodka in school, lose counsciousness, vomit, and go to the hospital in an ambulance.

"I feel like I shouldn’t exist Ever since I was a kid I was always yell “I don’t wanna be here” I’ve been severely depressed since a child I’m right a leg amputee I suffer with social anxiety and chronic PTSD from being abused as a kid I never had a childhood forced to sell drugs at the age of 10-16 by my own brother, neglected by my mother and my father was never in my life I have no friends only girl I loved told me I should stop loving her because she was cheating on me for 3 years

As pathetic as it sounds I feel like being alive is a chore and never thought I should be alive I have constant Suicidal thoughts that never end for years my family has turned a new leaf and all reunited, I got a high paying job as a software engineer and I even am going back to college but I still feel nothing about these they don’t even make me wanna stay alive

I don’t know how to stop these thoughts this feeling and I feel like it’s getting worse as I get older I’m 22 alone and push everyone that close to me away and isolate myself with my thoughts which makes it worse

I try to distract myself with games, simple pleasures and other activities but even when I do I notice I always fake a smile where ever I am work, school or family reunions but nothing helps 


I don’t know what’s wrong with me or why I am the way I am I recently cut my wrist 5 times for the very first time in my life I promised I would never no matter how bad it gets but I did and scary to say it felt great and thats what I’m afraid of I believe one day I will take my life or atleast build up the courage too 

I tried theraphy, im heavily medicated but I still just hate existing I hate living and its getting worse and worse as I experience more about life even the good makes me think about dying

I just want peace and when I google people experience on dying and coming back they always say it’s peaceful and hell when they come back I know I’m probably fucking crazy I don’t want to admit it though but living just feels like I’m in hell already ",depression

"Accepting suicidal thoughts I’ve been learning recently to accept and feel my emotions. Today was the first day I came to terms with why people commit suicide. This was the first time instead of denying that I would ever do it, I understood why I would want to do it. Will I ever go through with it? Probably not, but accepting is as a valid feeling was opening and grounding in a way. It’s teaching me to come to terms with things. I find myself constantly not feeling content with most of the things in my life, but accepting that this is the way it is is key. Just my two cents. ",depression
"Tired. I want my room to be clean, decluttered, and most of all I want to be happy in my bedroom. My room are neither of these things. My biggest fear is being found dead surrounded by my mess and clutter. I’d be mortified from the afterlife (or whatever) 
I guess the mess and clutter keep me alive.

My doctor has told me not to clean my room until I’m im a better place.

My mother on the other hand nags on my to clean my room, even offers to help. I know she means well, she belives a clean room witll help my mental health. But every time she pushes me to clean my room she doesn’t understand the implications of her words.

But if my room is clean, what is there left to keep me alive?


Anyone experienced something similar?",depression
"Any reason anymore. I should be happy, I have a “good” life. 

For the last 5 years I’ve been planning to kill myself, I’ve never reached out to anyone ever ñot even the anonymous help lines. I don’t want to feel like I’m a burden to anyone. The only reason I have ñot killed my self is because I would make others upset, but each month day second I’m becoming more numb to the feeling of pain and I’m getting closer to the plan. I know every step every detail how I’ll do it, it’s just when.

Ive given myself two weeks, on the 23rd of November at 9pm I’m going to end this suffering. This gives me enough time to distance myself from my friends, break up with my girlfriend and give away my stuff. 

The only reason I’m doing this post is so I’m heard somewhere by someone, I don’t care if people respond to this atleast my thoughts are out there at some point in time.

"At this point. I'm not sure anymore if I'm depressed or just filled with so much internal rage. I read somewhere before that there's two type; Either ""you are a sad person with a normal life or a normal person with a sad life"". And I consider myself the latter. And now, I'm just internally angry at everything.. I never wanted to be born at the first place but heck I was raised into a family where no one is normal (so toxic and dysfunctional). And whenever I hear someone told me ""I'm hear for you, you can talk to me whenever bla bla bla"". All I feel is triggered, cause those people that said that, were never there when I was asking for help, when those times I was caught in accident and got injured, when I was scammed real hard lost half of my money, when someone sexually harassed me and when I was struggling with college bullying, no one was truly there, and the only 2 people that I successfully reached out to, heck yeah, they just betrayed me and spread gossip about what happened to me in college. And now I'm just so F angry at everything. Fck those people who kept romanticizing mental health support and being a hypocrite saying ""they're here to support you"" blablabla. Atleast, pls don't say those words, if you don't really mean it.",depression
"I am sooo over this! I'm ridiculous, My life is amazing! But I've always had a hormone imbalance... Never suicidal, but very homicidal... Recently I have got this grip of depression, and I know it!

"Feeling numb (tw vague sh mention) I've been wanting to hurt myself because of how numb I've been. I've been clean for about a month almost but I can't even feel proud because of how numb I've been. 

My birthday was this Halloween and my family tried making it nice for me since we were moving. I was grateful but didn't even feel really happy that day. 

Same went for my anniversary with my boyfriend. I love him so much and he really is the only thing keeping me living. We don't live in the same state anymore so I've been feeling even more numb without him around. 

I can't smoke or cut. Those are the only things that make me feel anything. This numbness is tiring and sometimes exhausting. My faith in humanity is low as always. Humans make me sick. Most relatable sentences, am i right? 

I try not living on depressing subreddits but I don't have friends lol. I can't ramble to anyone besides my boyfriend and I don't wanna worry him. So I'm on here, rambling. I like talking to myself, but I found strangers on the internet are more fun and give acknowledgement. You agree, right? 

Anyway, that was quite the ramble lol. I tend to do that (autism lol)",depression
"How do I become happy? I live with pretty toxic parents, my dad constantly tells me that my brain is like that of a 5 year old, he makes very violent comments about my brain, my mom also talks down on me  and they keep saying that I get angry when they are giving advice. 

I used to ignore their nasty comments about me but now I'm finding it hard to ignore them. I don't love myself as I used to and I'm very depressed.

"Dont know what to do anymore /venting Im sorry if this is long.

I dont know what to do. Im married (27m) with a 1 year old child with my wife and have a small dog. My wife doesnt work due to the baby and i work full time.

Due to some unforseen circumstances, in 2022 we ended up moving in with her parents. Since then, i feel like its been the worst decision of my life. I do not get along with her father, he judges me constantly and talks about me constantly behind my back, etc. I know im not perfect but he is constantly on my case about literally everything and at this point its just annoying. Ive became extremely detached from everything since being here. It actually feels very similar to my childhood situation when i lived with my emotionless mother, i use to lock myself away which is what is happening now.

 I have tried to be better: I have gone to therapy, seen a psychologist, taken medication for anxiety and depression, gone to the gym, and eaten better. No matter what I do, someone points out that I am doing things wrong. ""You're not a real man because you don't have your own place and cannot provide for your family"" or ""You don't go to the gym enough; you make excuses."" These comments trigger ""PTSD-like"" symptoms in me because my father used to say similar things, as did my mother's husband. I don't know why the adult men around me feel the need to target me like this, but my therapist suggested that it might be because they are intimidated by me. I don't know.

The gym thing, for example, I used to go four to five days a week. My wife complained that it was hard for her to watch the baby for longer hours and asked if I could cut back, so I did. I would come home and take care of the baby until I got rest for work. I ended up only going to the gym one to three times a week. Guess what happened next? He came and said I was making excuses and that I wasn't man enough to make time to go to the gym more. I was done. Since that altercation, I decided not to care anymore and just do what I feel is right, but nothing I do is right to anyone. Even my marriage is extremely strained. I want to move out, but I don't want to leave my daughter behind. I know with work and everything it will be hard for me to tend to her on my own, so the best bet is to have her stay with her mom, but I just can't find it in me to leave. It's also hard due to financial reasons; places around me charge an arm and a leg.

My therapist asked me what I have done so far in life, and the only things I can think of are that I graduated high school, left for the Army right after and served six years, work full-time now, and have a child. She tells me to feel proud of my accomplishments, but others put them down.

I'm just at a loss and don't know what to do with my life. I know I'm not perfect, but why do people feel the need to point out all my flaws and problems? Some days I just want to end it all, and others I feel like I can't miss out on my little one's life as she would need me. 💔 I am sorry again for this long post.",depression
"I feel like I'm declining further  Since the election in the US, the last few days have been terrible for my mental health. Had to leave work early because I felt I couldn't function well, I've stopped taking my ADHD meds and sertraline so I can start drinking away my feelings the last few nights. When that depression hits me extra hard, I have a history of having bad energy and being obviously upset at work, like right now.  I'm trying really hard to feel okay, I'm trying to ground myself. I feel embarrassed having people see me so quiet and sad so often, yet I can't even pretend I'm okay or act like I want people to talk to me. I know my last few days of drinking is just due stress, and I don't usually stress drink. And for the first the first time in a while I'm feeling a bit suicidal. Nothing's okay, I can't control my emotions. I feel constant despair, my breathing becomes difficult, my chest feels heavier. I'm tired.",depression

"Not sure why I should go on. Tired of being alone or used.  Its 1 AM and i just need to get this off my chest. 

I literally just don't know what to do anymore. I grew up with a loving family and was the eldest between me and my brother blah blah blah. I was raised in my life that I should dedicate my life to paying my family back for raising me. But the way I was taught growing up forced me to be a loner and loser.   
Rules.  
1. I could only wear clothes and accessories approved by my family. 

2. My male friends were strictly vetted to the point where my family would even call these peoples parents and tell them not to let their kids associate. 

3. If i was found with a females number on my phone i was be strictly disciplined. (included the parents talking to not let us associate.)

Punishments for these included not being able to enjoy hobbies, beatings, emotional abuse, and more than once I was locked in my basement. 

My cousin that i grew up with maybe two years older then me. He continually lied on my name. Telling my parents i did something i didn't do or said something i didn't say. Leading to more of these punishments. At one point my punishment was to go to school, come home. And be locked in my room with literally nothing. Not even a paper and pen. no books. No entertainment. All because he said i disrespected him in a way i didn't do. 

At one point i broke down leading my family to forced me to attend this religious focus group that taught me basically the same rules listed above. And i did it because maybe if i made my parents happy i could get some sort of freedom. 

All of this led me to be the loner and loser i am today. unable to make friends. Unable to find a relationship with girls. I don't even fit into my local community. People will say out loud not to talk to me and that i'm weird or challenged or some other horrible disrespectful stuff pertaining to my race or character or upbringing. 

  
Now here comes my brother. Someone who didn't have to follow any of these rules. Who wasn't brought up with a shit bag cousin lying on his name. He gets whatever designer clothes he wants. Allowed to wear gold and silver (I was beaten for asking the same). Allowed to be friends with whoever he wants. Allowed to go to other females houses (something i was locked away for even asking for). Mother fucker even had sex on MY bed while both our parents were downstairs. Uk who drove him to these females houses while girls in bikinis were waiting outside for him. Me. Uk what would happen if i refused? This emotionally manipulative bullshit that i owe my family for raising me. Raising me how? To be a fucking loser? To not let me enjoy the life he was given the freedom to have. 

My ex that i have fought tooth and nail to be with left me not to long ago and ill explain why. My parents didnt like her and at times disrespected her. They told both of us if we got married to never speak to them again. My little brother was allowed to go to whore after whores house with me as his personal driver but i finally find someone special to me that's my treatment? Yea i could've been better to at times. But i was never taught how to love or interact properly. Even she said it to me before it ended. 

I dont plan to hurt myself in anyway. But i want to carve my heart out. i explained all this to my family before but all they say is stop saying this its in the past, while i watch my younger sibling do everything i wanted to do. If or when i do decide enough is enough. i want them to read this over my corpse. I dont have enough money to be able to leave. If i did and i didnt have to pay my parents for raising me along with school bills and whatnot i would have left a long time ago. But im also scared to leave. Even if im treated poorly its better then being alone. With my skills i wouldn't even make new friends. id be alone in my apartment anyway. 

  
Sorry about all the grammar and spelling mistakes im tired. I just needed to write this so i can have some peace of mind to sleep. Start again tomorrow driving my sibling back and forth to wear he wants to go and playing video games by myself. Drinking myself into another coma. Oh if anyone plays bo6 my in-game name is the same as my reddit user and I'm really bad. ",depression
"I think I’m better Since 2020, I didn’t realize it but I was depressed. I thought it was just my personality changing from being isolated. When I got back to school in 2022, it didn’t feel the same. I was a freshman in high school and I was already worried about that fact. When it started, I was extremely worried about talking to people. I started to mumble when I talked to people, I talked quieter, and because of those 2 things on top of me being already worried, I think it sent me into a depression. I developed body dysmorphia, I stopped talking to my classmates. I didn’t realize what was happening to me at the time but now it’s so clear. 

I clearly knew something was wrong, but I thought I was just being dramatic. Probably for the last 3 months or so, I was feeling more confident about my self. I started to go out of my comfort zone more often. I began going to the gym more. I’ve been getting better for a while and I didn’t even realize. 

I’ve been looking up how it feels to come out of being depressed, and it’s pretty much exactly what I’m feeling. The sun shines brighter, you feel better about yourself, you start talking to people more, you think about things differently and in a better way, you feel like you can pretty much do anything. A few days ago I woke up, and something was very different. I used to get mad about every little thing in the world. I would hate people for no reason. I’d hate myself. A few days ago, it’s like I just woke up and knew something was different. It’s like there was a switch inside of me that was stuck in the sad position. I felt as if no one was looking at me as close as before. For the past 4 years I’ve felt as though every single one of my moves was being watched. Every time someone laughed around me I would think they were laughing about me. I felt very self conscious about the clothes I was wearing and even things as small as where I was putting my hands. The past few days I’ve been thinking it might be mania or something. I don’t have a history of being bipolar or anything, but I’ve heard of it. Now I look back and see that I was just getting better. It’s like those 3 months we’re building up to this exact moment, and the switch finally flipped. I feel as though I will never go back to who I was during those 4 years. I would have never been able to sit here and write all of these words in the state I was in. I have never felt so clear minded in my life. It’s like I’m a kid again, with no worries in the world


I think and know now that depression takes time to heal from. If you are suffering from anything that sounds like mine, please get help! It is no way to live how I was for so long. I was so scared to reach out and talk about my feelings. But you shouldn’t be. Everyone thinks the same, no one is looking at you, you’re simply a person, trying to do the best they can. I feel like I am alive again, and you will too when you get through it. It definitely takes time, when you’re in a depressive state you don’t believe any of the words that are said to you, but just trust me cause I have literally felt the same way. Don’t ever think that you are never gonna be better, because you genuinely will, I never thought I would ever be the same again. And if you are coming out of your own depression, it’s normal to kind of obsess about how you randomly got better one day. I just thought I might help a few of you. Just trust the words I say, and you can get better. ❤️‍🩹

I discovered recently that by duct taping my mouth shut, putting on a sleeping mask, wearing headphones, and then slipping a garbage bag over my head numbs my pain. The feeling of asphyxiation and complete darkness puts me in a strange state of calmness. I usually take off the bag and duct tape when I start having violent spasms. I've timed and recorded myself before. The spasms usually start after 6-10 minutes.

When I put on the bag, I feel numb. But not painful mental numbness that I've become far too familiar with. When I don't have the bag on, all my thoughts are negative. I feel like I don't deserve to live, I feel intense feelings of self hatred, I feel really lonely, and I feel urges to hurt myself or kill myself. I also have constant panic attacks. When I put on the bag, my mind clears and I'm in a strange between-awake-and-asleep feeling. It just feels good. I realize now that I'm becoming addicted to this sensation. I do it every time I'm alone.

I recognize that I need help, but In a strange way I don't desire to get better. Everyone feels sad. Not being sad would just be fake. What's the meaning of living without pain? And I don't really view myself with enough value to go through the trouble of trying to stop. It helps, and I'm already planning on killing myself. I don't see much of a point.",depression
"I feel so alone and nothing changed I am so sad right now because of that I barely changed and I'm only getting older. I don't have any friends and I don't have any idea how to earn money (I'm 19 and have no job yet). I am so used to being the only one who's receiving. I never give anything to anyone. I know I'm still young and there's no reason to panic, but what if I'm still like this (which I won't let it happen). I've been saying the same thing for years.

Will it get better? I'm tired of seeing others with friends while I am not being seen. I hate myself but I guess any harm to myself won't help. Hurting myself won't atttact others and anything good. But I am so tired of being me. I wish to be gone. I haven't seen anything that is good for me yet except my parents. I am so depressed that they're the only people I know and closed with in my town. 

I think I know what to do to get better. Improve my life and stop my bad habits yadayadaya. But I'm having doubts that what if I'm still lonely? What if I do get friends but no other people tend to get closer with me? ",depression

"Feeling like its all going bad again This will probably be decently long i just need an outlet to put all my feelings at cause when I don't talk about things it makes everything so much worse. I've had depression most my life (I'm 19) and so it's always there in the back of my mind it's not like I had it and got happy and it's come back all of a sudden. It just feels like it's gotten really bad again like it was when I was in middle school.

I tend have these breakdowns that are really intense and sometimes they last longer than others and right now it's been going on for about a week and I'm tired I feel worn out mentally and physically.  At night I don't do my little routine anymore before bed because it feels exhausting even though it's nothing crazy.. what's triggered all this is idk lots of things. I've been lonely my whole life too I'd say I didn't have a normal social life I've had what I'd call a phone addiction since like 11. Mostly addicted to talking to friends I've met or just using it as a form of comfort which has majorly fucked me up now I can't tell you how many times I've been checking my phone these past few days like it'll magically heal me. Especially at night when I'm completely alone in my room it's like I can't put it down and just sit with my thoughts it's genuinely bad.. I've been feeling extra alone lately which has caused this major depressive episode I won't get into details because it is about my relationship and I don't want to discuss topics that include someone close to me like that on a post like this just it's been hard cause I feel my whole life I've been the person comforting me and I don't often feel comforted by other people. I just want to have that feeling that someone else cares besides myself.

Its really hard for me to feel so completely alone it's happened multiple times in my life and it's gotten to a point where I feel so over it like why can't I just feel good why do things keep happening? it's like an endless loop i keep going through the same things at different points in my life. I want to feel like i can be vulnerable without being scared I'm too much but I think maybe that's just how it's supposed to be? I'm too much and it's something people don't want which i don't blame them at all I'm probably draining to be around especially for my partner I guess I'm writing all of this cause no matter what I do i can't stop thinking bad things or crying and I know the only thing that will make me feel better is talking to the person I need to and getting out of this episode but right now it feels like the end of the world for me which I know is silly. I wish it was easy being human but it's not and it's hard to find how I'm supposed to feel content in life with the problems I have. There's so much more I could say and ramble about but I'm not good with words at all and I feel stupid so yeah.",depression
"I was told I was selfish I tried to end my life recently due to struggling with depression and anxiety. I was called selfish by a couple of people in my family for wanting to die. 
But what they don’t understand is suicide is not just I want to die. There’s so many reasons. 

. I need an escape from all my negative thoughts
. There is no future that I want to live in 
. I feel trapped and need a way out
. No one cares if I’m alive and I don’t deserve to be here 
. I need a break from reliving trauma

"For anyone interested in reading/vent 29/F

Long story short upbringing childhood is, I’ve had major depression since as long as I can remember. I didn’t enjoy things like a normal kid, my parents spoiled me, I’ve gone on many vacations, I’ve been given many opportunities to be great. I love to sing, play tennis. Went to catholic school, was bullied there for about 8 years. I always had 1 friend for a very long time (10-15 years) I never liked groups. I would say I’m attractive, but not skinny rich girl attractive. It dawned on me today that I’ve never felt free to be at max happy. I never feel free enough to dance.

My parents and I don’t have a great relationship. My mother has even said I didn’t turn out the way she meant, and guilts me. My dad has mental issues and is a clepto amongst other weird shit.

I would say I don’t hate my personality, can definitely put on a face to be social. I’ve never been happy, but I’ve justified that by understanding every emotion is fleeting. I’ve read a ton of self help books, love to exercise, be outside. Yet, I’m always never a full person, and I can feel that ceiling. 

As far as therapy goes; I’ve had multiple in my life, forced and not forced. Tried meds. But I don’t want to gain weight, and I’ve always convinced myself it’s better to not take meds. 

I have isolated the things i do that depression might make do. Push people away, hide, lash out. I know I’m loved, and I have wonderful people I love. I hate to work and want to quit every job. I’m older now, and not having a career or full education is a large part of my sadness. That typical stuff. But it’s come to the point where I’m so tired of trying to be better and stable. I’m lashing out at strangers, which is completely out of character for me. For reference, Idgaf about small talk. I understand why it’s important to a degree. But again, I am incredibly tired of pretending that I care about a hello from a strangers

Another add is: I got into a car accident in January and got a hole in my leg basically. It got infected, and I can’t even can run like i enjoy doing. And gained weight. 

Anyway the point of this is to say, I have a new symptom of this after a lifetime of ups and downs and apathy. Which is basically just being mute and staring at a wall. Or just straight up dissociating and not being able to come out of it as easy now. I started this new job, and I don’t talk to anyone. If I do, I feel like a robot. Not fitting in with the culture here. I ignore my family. And talk when I feel it seems right to do so, for being a human-sake and knowing we need to. And there are times or weeks where I really love to say hi. I’ve come to a point where I’m worried Ive gone down a hole of just existing and have gotten worse, when I don’t feel as bad as I have in the past. ",depression
"Unmotivated and Hopeless Welp, started Sertraline at 50mg about 1-2weeks ago and I just have no motivation to do anything.

Still feel that life is pointless and hopeless, hoping everything would end. I have exams in 4 days but I can't be bothered at all. 

Also, I am so afraid of finding a job after my exams end. I feel like a useless person and nobody is ever gonna hire me. 

The worst part is I'm so lonely but I'm also scared to date again after my last break up. I still miss my ex and want everything to go back to how it was.

Life feels so pointless and hopeless. Losing my job & losing my bf is just insane and has been affecting my mental health so much. I just wish I didn't have to do it anymore.

I have tried pretending that I'm happy and I'm okay whenever I'm with my friends but its just tiring me out.

I have isolated myself from my friends and family. I feel like a useless person and a burden that no one cares about enough. Maybe it would be better that I just leave this place and never come back. At least I don't have to disappoint anyone or feel the pain anymore.",depression

"I'm Honestly Scared & Confused I'm 21 years old,I live with my grandma because she just lost grandpa and doesn't want to be alone she also has dementia so I have to be very patient and careful with her regarding what I say otherwise she cries.
I moved out of mom's to take care of grandma
Currently I work security and have my free 2 years from the state of Michigan for community collage.

The reason why I said all of that is to give a little backdrop, I don't know what I want out of life and I'm thinking how bout how I have no actual reason to live, if I die my dog will be safe with family, if I die my grandma can be taken care of,
My sister hates me or at least heavily dislikes me
I don't talk to my mom anymore because of her bi polar disorder scaring me with how frequent she changes moods Currently using her as a proxy for insurance by paying her the fee so I don't get screwed over by insurance companies.
For the 1st year of my life I managed to keep a job (security) for long enough I made enough for taxes so that's something else for me to be scared of because I don't know how to do taxes.
I have a bad porn addiction that I wasted thousands of dollars on but I've stopped that and stopped wasting my money on that stuff. I'm trying to lose weight and get a better diet
I have no diet and I don't have the motivation to actually work out so I've gotten sorta husky. I can't get a girlfriend because after every 1st date it just dies out.
My social skills are terrible because I've been told all my life to speak up or shut up, I have no friends and recently I asked a female co worker out on a friendly outing (movie)  after discovering neither of us had friends, we exchanged numbers but this morning she said she didn't want to have a relationship or be friends.
So I'm feeling rejected and just bad all around.
I can't find the motivation for anything, I have a broken headlight on my car, I ordered the parts and that was over a month ago and I still haven't fixed it out of sheer laziness.
In short I'm lost and confused what I want in life and how to do it and I'm scared.

"I'm so lost from the title, and the page we're on, you can prolly assume what ima talk abt. also btw sry for any typos.

okay so for context, im a 14 year old girl and ive been depressed since 5th or 6th grade. ik yall may not beleive it,but ig thats just how this works. i also come from a pretty well off family. actually, like- reall well off. see most people are like, ""omg i wish i was rich"" but being rich and being in a high class is differeent. being in the upper class is constant pressure. i have to do 5 sports, i am taking 4 AP classes(im only a freshman) and i have to get into a good college or else ill lowke be disowned. sometimes idk what to do. its so much pressure to do good, but i dont wanna do it anymore.

okay, so ive been honor roll track since kindergarden, taking art classes and everything. i even went to that kumon shit they have kids do to get better at math or smth. and in like 4th grade, that was fine. we were in covid so it was a nice break. i had basically no friedns to miss, so that wasnt an issue. i know covid is when a lot of depression started, but not mine. 

so when we came bac from covid, my one friend i had left me for another group. i was basically a loner. i was the ""weird kid"" and no one liked me. but then we moved from nyc to florida in 6th and that was better. i got a new tsart and now i have a lot of firends. why a i not happy? because now im in 9 extra curiculars, 2 sports at the current moment, and im juggling all these honor and AP classes. 

im so burnt out of life rn. its too much and i just dont wanna try anymore. but i also dont wanna die. its not a su!c!de thing, just a dpression, sorta thing. i lowkey just feel numb.

When things were looking up and a few years ago I did get a girlfriend and friends, I still felt empty, and that girl would go on to make me feel like I'm worthless.

I'm probably autistic in a world meant for non autistic people. I have thoughts and behaviors behind closed doors that would make me sound like Joe Goldberg and totally identify me as a creep.

on the other hand, i feel... melancholic? i know there are things i would like to do, food i would like to try, books i would like to read... it's not like i have nothing left. i feel sad that i won't get to do all the things i would've liked to do before i go. but being honest, i used to feel this way even before having a plan and a date set. the pass of time is something i've never had a good relationship with. i feel tucked by it constantly. and even if it makes me sad, at the very least that pressure is gone, since it's not like i don't know if i'll have enough time to anything - no, now i know i won't. it's a fact. and nothing that i'd like to try (or i know i would had liked to try, because as i said nothing feels exciting now) weights enough to change my decision, even if it makes me kind of sad. it's as if i was watching myself from the outside and saying ""he had so much life to live"" while knowing my destiny full well. 

and then, there are my loved ones. i feel terrible every time i talk to them. i feel like i'm lying and i feel so guilty about everything. if there's something i know to appreciate at this point in my life is that i'm not alone. i have a partner whom i love, friends that try to support me (i don't like these apparently fully distinguished terms ""friends"" and ""partner"" - i'm more of a relationship anarchist, but it's just for the sake of people who can read this to understand easily), my relationships with the biological family i have left have improved since i moved out. and i feel so sorry for them. i feel so guilty not telling them what's about to come. i feel so bad for not caring enough about them to keep going. i know they care about me and i don't want them to feel like it's their fault (i will say this on my goodbyes). they've done everything they could and even more. they just can't help me because there's no problem besides myself. and i'm really sorry that i'm making them go through this, because i know for a lot of them it's not a good time right now either. 

i'm also scared of surviving. i don't think i can handle the days after an attempt. all those worried sights that try to hide themselves behind a try-to-be-friendly-and-suppotive smile. everyone knowing what you did while no one saying it out loud. everyone carefully choosing their words and actions around you, scared at the possibility of triggering you. the feeling of failure, pitifulness and guilt that comes with it. and not knowing what to do afterwards. i think that my fear of not being successful is one of the things that make me so determined about this being the time i finally do it. 

idk man. i've had suicide attempts before, but being honest nothing has felt more determined than this. it's almost as if i was watching these last days of my life with no agency to save myself - the decision is taken and i can't do anything about it at this point. ",depression
"I feel like I’ve wasted my youth. I (21F) have been struggling with severe depression for a while.

Those who don’t know me personally would never even think to make this assumption as i am an optimistic performer. I have a very happy demeanor because I am hyperaware of emotional projection, and truly believe people do not deserve any sort of consequence to my personal misery.

I realized my depression and time do not co-exist. I have now spent over 4 years bed rotting and neglecting my physical and mental health by consuming meaningless media, eating food, chasing moments of temporary happiness. These 4 years have felt like weeks, I can’t believe the amount of time i’ve spent neglecting myself.

One of the hardest things to wrap my head around is the fact that although my world has stopped, other peoples continue. I know it’s unhealthy to put yourself in a state of comparison, but it’s true. These years of my life have been crucial and I did it all wrong.

My peers are graduating college, while i got accedamically suspended at community college, now on academic probation as a first year student, when really i should be completing school.

I’m embarrassed, and my parents deeply resent me because of this. They don’t believe in the concept of mental health, my depression is nothing but an excuse to my laziness to them, I wish they knew it runs so much deeper.

I’m so tired of living like this. I don’t understand why it’s so hard for me to love myself. I feel like a burden to everyone I encounter. I am constantly reassured by others that I am a positive light (and for that I am blessed) but my brain deems it as pity, or a wrong assumption due to them truly not knowing who I am.

I don’t know how long this will last, I fear that i will continue down this path and remain stuck in my misery. What sucks is I do believe I have so much to offer and have the potential to be successful, I just don’t know why I can’t be kind to myself.

"Why I’m depressed  1. My mother has been constantly in and out of hospital for 2 years now. She was diagnosed with breast cancer back in 2023 and although she’s clear now, my family have a long history of cancer. Both my grandmas had cancer, my uncle has been diagnosed with cancer recently (I think not too sure on details but my family never tell me anything) my grandmas sister died of cancer before my grandma was even born (she died at 2 years old of cancer). Basically what I’m saying is that because there’s such a long history of cancer my mother had an operation to have her ovaries removed so she wouldn’t be at risk of cervical cancer. Also not to mention me and my sister are potentially very screwed over as we’ve come to the conclusion we could be at higher rush of getting cancer. 
 2. My family is literally falling apart around me and I’ve left most of the people I know clueless. I live in two different places (my friends mostly don’t know), parents are divorced (again friends don’t know), my mum quote literally has a boyfriend and two children (daughters slightly older than my sister who’s 18). My sister won’t make any efforts to get to know these people so I’m on my own again trying to make myself likeable for a family I don’t even care about.
4. Exams, too many exams that I have 0 confidence in as I’m definitely not an academic weapon and executive dysfunction is my worst enemy at the moment.
5. Intrusive thoughts that are so bad. Every 5 minutes my brain is telling me stuff that just isn’t true of telling me If I don’t do a certain action e.g. tap a pen 3 times I’m going to fail these exams.
5. I can’t end it because I’d make people sad (I wish it didn’t though) and also I don’t want to traumatise my parents because they’ve been through enough. My mum lost her dad at 21 and my dad lost his father at 15. My Grandma (mothers;mother) has severe dementia and my mother just seems to be loosing it a lot.",depression

"Tired of life Feeling so alone and unloved. I don't know how to continue living like this. I live abroad, and once a year I visit my home country it turns out to be constant fights, screaming that make to do self harm. So many childhood traumas, family members struggling with their own demons.
 I have a hard time making friends I feel like I'm not even the second tier person to the people, not sure if I'm the third tier. 

Mutual friends I introduce to each other seem to be hitting off better with me excluded, which is ok, but it feels so abandoning some times. People keep bailing on plans to hang out, it feels like they only can see me only when all of the other people are not available.
Never had a normal relationship (36F), seems like men only want me for sex, and no one see me as a person.

I feel like a shadow, abandoned, worthless, unseen and forgotten. People at work and at social functions walk off in the middle of me speaking. I just wish someone cared about me.

Went to the therapy for years, tried medications, nothing seem to work.
Tired of living like this, tired of trying to better myself and my life, but it all seem worthless.

 Gravitating more towards finding the will to end it all, as more therapy and more self work seems like a waste of time as no one likes or cares for me. It feels like it never gets better. ",depression

would anybody like to tell me how being sa'd by your mom is better than dying. would anybody like to explain to me how living your entire life with everyone that was supposed to love you turning their backs on you is better than dying. would anybody like to explain how being chewed up and spit out over and over and over again is better than dying. would anybody like to explain how nobody ever wanting you is better than dying



all my reasons to live are all about everyone else but myself. im not living for me. im not happy being alive

"How do I tell my girlfriend that she's damaging my mental health How do I tell my girlfriend that my mental health is in a shit state, and she's contributing to this?

Context: 
I have pre-existing childhood trauma that really affects my self worth and confidence that I'm not going to go into here, but the full story is in another post I made if anybody wants to see. 
I'm a Medic in the Royal Navy, I fucking love my job, and without wanting to big myself up I'm pretty good at it. 

I (25m) live with my girlfriend (23f) of two years, and lately I've been struggling a lot. 
Of the two of us she is definitely the smarter, she's got her shit together. 
Meanwhile I'm waiting on an ADHD referral
Sometimes I do dumb shit or just don't think of things. The result is that I feel like I'm under scrutiny all the time, because I feel like she don't respect me or trust me. 
There's times I feel micromanaged and it's very disheartening.

I'll admit I do dumb shit sometimes, but the problem is that if I'm under scrutiny, I overthink. When I overthink I make mistakes; and it's a repeating cycle and a self fulfilling prophecy 

I don't know how to resolve this because I can't expect her to just suddenly trust me, but I do want her to not automatically assume that I'm being an idiot. 

It's really depressing because I know I'm no more of an idiot than the next man but then I feel like I'm useless

It's not just that either, one thing that's been causing a big problem is the fact that my hearing isn't great. It's got not much to do with actual hearing as it does with ADHD. When I discussed it with my doctor we discussed the possibility that I might have auditory processing disorder - which is part of ADHD- where you can have good hearing but if you have background noise, you're concentrating on something, or anything else that could distract you you just don't hear other things. 
We went bowling tonight and the music was very loud but she would talk at a normal level, so I didn't have a hope of hearing and kept asking her to repeat herself so she stopped bothering to talk to me at all so we ended up bowling in all but silence and it was utterly crushing

"When should a person go to a psychiatric hospital? So about a week ago I started a new anti depressant. It made me very sick, like to the point where I was shaking, drenched in sweat, diarrhea, and having panic attacks. I was also feeling very depressed and suicidal. I almost called an ambulance but was able to make it to the hospital on my own. My dr switched my medication and today the same thing happened. I had to stop working because I felt the same symptoms and started dry heaving until I took a sip of water and threw up. I checked my bp using the machine in the break room and it was 142/81 and my heart rate was 112, so I left and went to urgent treatment. 

Now I’m contemplating on if I should go to psychiatric in patient or not. I’m to the point where I’m terrified of taking another new antidepressant. I also can’t keep leaving work early because of a reaction to my medication. Personally I would like to take an fmla leave until I can get my medication figured out, however I’m not qualified because I haven’t been at my current job for 12 months. I feel like going in patient would be good because they could try different medications and I’d be somewhere safe if something were to happen again. It’s also an excused absence from work. However, I feel like mentally I’m just not at a point where I feel like I’m a threat to myself or others. Most of the time I feel fine (still depressed but overall fine) mentally, but it’s when I’m having severe reactions to my medication that I feel like I want to die. 

If anyone could help point me in the right direction, I would be very appreciative. Thank you for reading my yap session.

"Goo Goo Dolls verse that hits close And I was in love with the things I tried to make you believe I was
And I wouldn't be the one to kneel before the dreams I wanted
When all the dark and all the lies were all the empty things disguised as me.

In a poetic way this verse sums up the personal interactions of my adult life.  This inability of mine to let people in to get to know the real me.  Only in the last years have I come to see that it was always a mentality issue.  A mental state.  For decades I tried physical remedies.  Get out more.  Relationships. Hobbies.  Education.  Networking.  And while all these things are positive on their own the issue at hand was always inside me.  Some wise quote goes ""a man who can't control himself will always be a slave"".  I made a slave out of myself by overguarding my ego from all the judgements of reality.  I couldn't tell you why I'm this way.  It's just always been since I can remember.  I was a child who lived in his thoughts and I became an adult who retreated to his thoughts whenever he could.   Nature or nurture?  These are just my thoughts into the void. ",depression

"HOW TO SUPPORT MY FRIEND WHO IS STRUGGLING  (TW MENTION OF SA,SH,SUICIDE)
As the title suggests, is anyone struggling with supporting a friend through their mental health journey? I’m currently navigating my own mental health challenges and trying to improve. However, hearing about someone else’s depression or mental struggles can sometimes make mine worse. It often pulls me back into negative patterns, and I find myself wanting to sink deeper into it, partly because I tend to be competitive in these situations.

One of my friends is dealing with severe trauma from being SA-ed and while I want to be there for her, I find it difficult to listen when she talks about things like hallucinations, sleepless nights, and her struggles—even though I haven’t had the same experiences. It’s just as hard as hearing her talk about suicide or self-harm. To set healthy boundaries, I’ve asked her not to talk about these topics with me, but she still insists that I’m the only person she feels she can vent to. I want to help, but I don’t know how, and I’m not sure what to do next.

I know she will respect my boundaries, but I know she will struggle in silence and that's even more worse. Can someone who maybe went through similar experiences tell me what you wish you friend did in this situation?",depression

"Working with Depression Hi, 

This is a genuine question I have for other people without high functioning depression and may even have executive dysfunction. How do you force yourself to work when its one of those days that you're struggling to get out of bed or do anything? 

  
I have been searching for a job for the past year and I am struggling on how to explain to jobs why I left previous jobs. I left my second job because my family felt like my depression was so bad and I was so suicidal that I needed to be in a psychiatric hospital. So, I quit, because they needed someone to work there and I wasn't even full time and I was unsure of how long I would be in the hospital. I quit my first job because I was working at a call center where I was getting 50-80 calls daily and I barely had downtime because of my second shift schedule. I didn't even leave the house on weekends because my social battery would be completely depleted from talking to 100s of people throughout the week. 

I tell jobs I left for medical reasons, but that doesn't seem to be enough for them when I left two jobs for the same reason. I'm only 23. My emotions feel so overwhelming on those bed rotting days and I'm already thinking about disappearing and not wanting to be alive more times than I should without my anti-depressants (psychiatrist practice shut down). I'm stressed because I can't find a job because of these and obviously other reasons and I'm stressed about what to do on those days that your brain just wants to bed-rot. Or you're feeling anxiety about how many people you have to deal with at work. Do I just stop trying to work in customer service. 

  
I really feel like I'm on my last leg and everything feels so suffocating and not worth it. I don't know want to live my life anymore because it feels like I've just been on a decline ever since I turned 18. And I don't see it getting any better no matter how many times my family and friends say things will. I just don't believe it. How can I keep going when I'm so pessimistic about staying alive. How are people even getting themselves out of bed? ",depression
"The Sun doesn't shine like it once did. Life has become so disappointing lately. The bad officially outweighs the good. Life is all about work, a thankless job. Zero free time. I haven't taken any time off since 2022, and it still feels like I'm not doing enough. Bad things will continue to happen to good people. It's become easier to be numb than to feel at all.

"mentally giving up  i (25f) recently lost my job and i just can’t get over it. i suffer with anxiety and depression anyway and this happened out of the blue and unfairly in my opinion and it’s hit me like a ton of bricks. i’d only been doing the job for a month and i was really trying, but this has made me feel worthless and stupid. i don’t know how to improve my self confidence, im extremely sensitive and my self esteem is on the floor. i’m job hunting and nothing is coming through and im just feeling deflated and tired. i can’t do it anymore. i am so tired",depression
"I just give up This is just a post to say I’m done I give up. I’ve tried to be better in work and life and with people and I just don’t think I can. I’m not suicidal exactly but I don’t have the will to live. I lost my grandfather who was my best friend almost 2 years ago and I have lost all internal thoughts and feelings. My family who is the only reason I’m around for as they need support in helping provide for the lives of others. I have sisters who rely on me a grandmother who does a mom who is retired all of them need me to work to provide for them. I believe my job is about to shift me to another location without any of my say or knowledge of what’s happening I have helped provide for everyone in my life in anyway they need but I can provide for myself. I’ve tried relationships therapy anything to just make myself feel somewhat like a person or normal or regular but I just fall into all day marijuana use random sex with women so ill feel something and because of my mind snapping from so much weighing on me and constant anger at life and just myself I always am just alone. So I guess this is a long winded way to say I’m not suicidal I don’t want to hurt myself but I just don’t wanna be here and have no choice. Toronto is not a nice place either.

"Cycles of slight function to no function in college. Hello. I've struggled with depression beginning senior year of high school and it hit full force-- I barely attended classes but still passed easily because we are a small school and people never fail. I made it into a college with almost a full ride and I achieved that once I talked to financial aid. 

I feel like I should be happier about this but truthfully I feel like I'm wasting it. 

In the course of the first 3 weeks I missed multiple classes well over 5 times resulting in a meeting to discuss my mental health, but I made an excuse about not having an alarm to wake up. After this it got better after I *did* get an alarm to wake up but after about a week I would start getting up and turning the alarm off and going back to sleep. I don't do any homework (essentially) but maintain a social life even though for a good portion of the week I never appear on campus because I'm sleeping. 

I've requested a counselor, in itself a massive step because I am generally incapable of asking for help or assistance on any matter, especially mental health.  I like to think that the state of the country is what consistently gets me down, but I'm not exactly at risk for my lifestyle to change because of the election, as I'm a cishet white male.

Pains come and go in the chest, my mind often seeks emptiness over fullness. I had a phase with DPH which I enjoyed specifically because it made my head emptier, almost like I was dreaming. Thankfully I stopped, but it is scary that the only reason I *did* was because I do not have any money, at all. This applies to all my previous drugs, cannabis, nicotine, alcohol, etc. If I had money, I would be using them intensively as I did in my senior year. 

I try not to show this side of me in public but the beginning of college marked a major transformation in my person (I *was* arrogant, talkative, and now I don't generally talk in class, and I don't exactly see myself as a good person anymore), and I think it's helped me ""show"" this side of me in public, but I fear it isn't enough.

People assume I'm lazy or otherwise, but it feels as though I physically can't do work-- I try and the headspace just isn't there. I don't know how else to describe it. It's like trying to move a muscle you don't have. ",depression

All the good opportunities and connections I had are gone now and so I’m stuck with job until either I retire or get fired. I’ve accepted that I’m never gonna be happy with my life and I’ll spend the rest of my life just thinking about what I should’ve done. I think about that everyday at it brings be to tears every other day. I’ve cried consecutive days for the last year. I’m just never going to be happy and so I guess I’ll just go through the motions until I die, which I’m hoping isn’t too far off.

"I'm so tired (Sorry for poor grammar I can't really think well atm)

I wouldn't say I have it as bad as some of the other people that have told their story on this subreddit but by no means am I alright.

I'm just a normal dude, 20 years old, I study, I game, I hang out with friends just like any normal dude would. I act nonchalantly around people and act as if all my problems would solve by themselves, but I worry. I worry all the time, whether it be big or small, the last thing I've achieved was my high school certificate 4 years ago. I've done nothing after it and I am currently at my lowest point ever. Every night I wonder if things truly get better even when I think of just committing suicide to make all of my problems disappear. 

I do know that I need help and I'm currently following therapy in order to come out as a stronger person, but as of right now I don't see the benefits at all. There are so many things I want to achieve but I just know I can't, because that's who I am. A guy who says a lot but never shows the work. Only my family and some friends know about my situation and I'm surrounded by good people but I just feel so fucking empty all the time. I also never experienced love with a girl due to my looks, I wouldn't say I'm that ugly but I'm just average and slightly overweight. I always thought some romance I my life could make it better, but now I just think I'd make my future partner crazy if I were to tell her all this.

Every now and then when I'm thinking about how shitty my life is suicide seems to cross my mind more and more, although I never really go further than that I still silently cry because I was like: ""What the fuck was I thinking? There's people who want me to succeed and to laugh"". But I just can't do it anymore. I'm tired and I feel like nothing is helping, at this point it's just a coinflip whether I wake up happy or depressed. I've also never really vented on the internet before so that's a first. It's gone so far that I made a fresh account just so I can evade my friends that follow me on my main account. I sincerely think that I'll be dead in the next 5 years, I don't care if it's a war, or I get killed, or I commit suicide. I just know I won't make it past 25.

Anyways that's about it regarding my situation, if any of you guys want to ask questions or just talk I don't really mind. Since it probably won't matter anyway.",depression

I could afford it monthly with the right job, but there's a list of things keeping me from it. I don't have my license due to anxiety, I'm states away from my birth city, I'm trying to find a remote/local job but I don't qualify for anything id actually like. Im trying to study for both a payroll job and my license, but my lack of motivation and feeling of being overwhelmed is baring me from moving forward. A payroll job isn't even what I truly want to do, living in my birth city is just a last resort. I want to do music and art but it seems like thats just a dream. I want to stay in my current city, i cant afford it making $20/hr. The apartment I'm looking at would be around 1,200 a month utilities included compared to an average 1,700 before utilities for one in my current city.

My mom is suggesting that we get medication for me before i feel like i lose control again. But, I really dont want to. Im so so so scared of the idea of losing the part to depression that made me feel at peace while suffering alone. I think it was just having that silent mind. And lacking all fear.

What do my friends see in this pathetic excuse of a human, that I am?
Even better question: who am I, anyway?

The best I can think of as myself is a book, which has an ugly cover and doesn't have a title, only the author's name. And the pages are just empty. Blank. It has no fucking purpose, no meaning, no worth, no use. It's just a placeholder.
Also, the pages are stained in cat piss, mouse shit, mold, and vomit.

Who the fuck, in their right mind, would keep around a book like this, between their perfectly normal and enjoyable books on their bookshelf?

It serves no use, no purpose and makes your stomach turn every time you see it, so why keep it around?

I want to take that proverbial book and light in fire, torn it apart, rip out it's blank pages piece by piece. 

Don't they see how revolting my very existence is?

Why do they want to keep me around, even if I am good for nothing?

"I want to curl up in a ball and die even though all I want to do is live I want to curl up in a ball and die even though all I want to do is live, more than anymore in my life. I'm facing a severe depressive episode.

I moved from my original home in Saudi Arabia as a young woman (for college) and moved to Canada. I grew up in a traditional Pakistani household. In no means was I ever meant to be the way I was raised. I developed a deep interest in looking beyond what I was taught, I became to my family, a very disturbed teenager to then just sucking up and being myself when I was alone but having a whole facade of what my family wanted out of me on the outside. The only reason being; it was the only way I was able to leave the country and be my own. I am grateful I had a roof over my head, never had to worry about my food, and my dad works his ass off to provide for us as there was no life to live in my home country; especially for our family. Despite having financial support in my life (my father continues to pay for my housing and tuition to continue to live here), everything else was never great. I faced physical, mental, emotional, verbal and sexual abuse at the hands of my family. They provided me with all the things I wanted, but not the secure love, but they were trying. They still try. But they also try to rid me of everything I am. Shame. That's the unfortunate feeling I walked away with. A ridiculous amount of guilt and shame. I was not allowed to be outside alone, never allowed to see friends or hang out with me until I was around 17, never allowed to be my own. I succumbed, cause I feel like I have a privilege no one else in my life has had. 

All of this, but I struggled with my mental health my whole life. Ever since I was a kid. The abuse made it worse (or caused it, I can't remember, I just remember feeling sad and then getting beat or verbally told off and just wanting to dissappear). Somehow, I still managed, despite very private severe depressive episode and suicide attempts/self harm. I remember one day my mom saw my wrist, found out, she was very angry with me. She would later remind me of it in future sessions of outbursts when she would get upset at me for just about anything. I will always remember her telling me she wished I had cut deeper. I know she didn't mean it, she has been through a lot, and there was always an undertone of almost a mutual understanding, looking back on it. Not necessarily her being kind and understanding, but I see in her eyes a young girl suffering like I do. I was also struggling with severe physical health problems. I would try to tell my family, they wouldn't listen. These health issues have been reoccurring in my life ever since, though I don't let it get as bad as I was before. I remember getting blood work done and my hemoglobin was at a 3.7 (I don't know the units but according to them it was supposed to be at a 9). The doctor was taken aback and had asked me how I was managing on a day to day doing school and everything. I don't know. I don't remember much. It was all a blur of late night breakdowns and struggling to sleep for days on end. 

Fast forward to now. I moved away to Canada, and my first year here started off in a positive outlook. Then I had a depressive episode again, then I picked it up and decided to completely change my life. I started doing MMA (something I was always passionate about) twice a day, training, cooking, pursuing my degree and doing well at it, and also maintaining all my hobbies. I also had a knack for organisation, keeping my house in tip top shape. I was living in dorms at the time. I had a roommate and she definitely noticed my depressive episodes, too. She was kind, but I was uncomfortable living with a stranger. I couldn't handle it. It pushed me to stay in my room more and later down the line, I would move away from campus with the support of my family as I told them how tough it was for me to have to live with someone. I feel like a brat. Then, it came again. I got hit with a depressive episode because I started to learn so much about mental health, as I was also going to counseling and seeing a physician for my depression. I got diagnosed with very severe ADHD and they believe I have some sort of clinical depression, anxiety, as well as something OCD related and they also think I might be on the spectrum. I was not shocked, I always knew there was something wrong with me. I started medication for mental illness and that is definitely a whole story on its own. I would take my medication on and off at the time.

The memories I had pushed away, current events that were occurring in my life (struggling with a semi-abusive relationship, all the normal young adult stuff probably) all of it just hit me. The final straw, my physical health went backwards again. I was still energetic though, but I had stopped going to MMA, I was hiking a lot, too. Canada is a beautiful country. Then I couldn't anymore. I got too physically and mentally weak. I continued to get help for both medically and on and off counseling (I was struggling to make it to appointments). Throughout this, it was well past my first semester in university. I was failing. Badly. I have continued to fail, to this very point. My transcript is all withdrawals with an acceptable grade here and there.

 I couldn't tell my parents, I still can't. My father paid for those courses. All that money, I wasted. I didn't also have a choice as I am legally obligated to be in school to abide by my study permit,  and it was my only way to stay in this country. I couldn't do anything else because my family made it very straight to the point that if I don't do this then I must return home and just live with them until I get married. They wanted me to be a doctor, and though I loved Biology, during this time I learned I didn't want to be a doctor or any of that, and I did love Biology but I loved the evolution side of it more. I learned I loved ancient history, and I switched over to anthropology. I fell in love. It's my passion alongside history in general. I couldn't tell my family about my degree. They would hate me. They would think I'm failure. So I have to lie about everything. Lie that I'm doing great, that I'm going to be a doctor, that I'm in university, that I'm going to be exactly what they want. If I don't, they will stop funding me. I have no other choice, I never had a choice to be financially independent, I lived in a country as not only a woman but a female immigrant so no one wants that in Saudi Arabia. I have a disdain to it anyway. It is filled with racism, sexism, and homophobia (I'm definitely not a straight woman, either). 

This started two years ago. I'm here today, still alive. And this depressive episode only spiraled. My home is all just rotting garbage that I don't have the energy to take out, but I've been actually trying. I've been trying and failing but still kicking but the weight of everything and just having depression has left me in rock bottom. I feel like a piece of shit disappointment spoiled bratty privileged daughter, I even dug my savings and constantly need to ask my family for money as I have no energy to make my own meals. Nor do I have the means to as my fridge makes me gag everytime I open it, my sink is full of rotting dishes, pots, pans, etc. So I order food. I can't do anything, but I have been trying little by little to see hope, yet I still breakdown and want to die in a time where I'm fighting so hard to live.

 I have also reapplied to extend my status here as a student, and considering the current political situation and understandably, an unconvincing transcript, I'm probably going to get deported or something. I don't feel like I even deserve to be here, I am in a privileged place and I have not done anything worthwhile out of it. Someone else who deserves to be here can't, while I can.

I hate myself and everything I am. I try to do things little by little as my counselor suggests, but it doesn't feel like the dawn of a new day. I feel absolutely disgusted by myself. I want to just curl up and die, but I so badly wish I could just live and live to help others. I want to be a voice of reason for many. I want to do so much, but those are just dreams. I'm afraid I'm going to lose my hard battle with depression. I don't even take any measures to hurt myself in any way. I think I'm just going to waste away until I become a shell of my former self. Then I won't be me anymore and rot away and die or do something to end it.",depression

I just don't want to feel so guilty about my brothers death and I just want to be left alone by everyone so I can do this and get it over and done with since it's genuine torture being in this fucking life I have friends and stuff yeah but I'm not ones favourite I'm no ones best friend and I'd rather just leave this world on my own terms and go see my brother 

By the way when people tell you it gets better that's the biggest load of bullshit anyone has ever told you it doesn't get better it doesn't and it never will 

During all this shit with my brother I had a girlfriend I thought she was alright until she started using blackmail and told me to answer my phone during my brothers best friends emotional speech at the funeral.i had decided enough was enough and left her and now she has a new boyfriend and he wants to beat my head in

"How to cope I’m not sure where else to write about this. But depression feels like something is constantly pushing against your will to live, to be productive, to be positive, to be happy. In all senses and all endeavours. It doesn’t matter if you realize this, because it’s pervasive and incessantly constant. 

My question to everyone struggling with depression or those who’ve had help with therapy or otherwise is, how do you overcome this?

I am so crippled by a lack of caring about anything I feel like I’m becoming nihilistic. ",depression
Feeling depressed🔪🔪🫀 I struggle with comparing myself to others especially people I know and aquantances and I feel like I'm not good enough and sometimes I wonder why I couldn't live like them like they have wonderful lives as I see what they post and meanwhile I'm just here at home the whole day with like no friends and insecure. I feel like nobody is ever there for me and nobody truly knows me and what I feel. I just wish I could get rich and afford anything I like. Just wish my life was different. But I thank God for giving me life and atleast I get food to eat shelter and clothing which some ppl may lack but I don't even know if it is right to want more,depression
"Been depressed most of my life but never this bad. Ive been struggling to eat (I love eating regardless of depression) which is off for me. It's because when I eat I literally get sick. Can't stomach more than 300-400 calories at a time otherwise I get nauseous. It sucks, I'll make a whole big meal and plate what I normally can eat, only to throw away 70% of it or putting in fridge to never eat again. Please help I'm losing so much weight. Is there a science behind why I get sick? Is my stomach not used to large amounts of food? 😔",depression
"My depression is hindering my ability to work. It’s starting to make me significantly less functional.  My depression has been affecting my work lately. I tell myself I’m gonna concentrate and get something done but then I still make mistakes. 

My boss pulled me aside and told me “I need to suck it up and everyone has bad days”. She’s not wrong everyone does, but I just feel like my depression is starting to make me not really functional and that’s not normal. 

I’m thinking of getting a less stressful job in the meantime while I get better. My boss isn’t really being nice and understanding. And the extra sad part is I’m training for a promotion I got before my depression took its dark turn. 

What do yall think? I feel horrible and like a bad worker. I feel like I need a new job or else this job and the boss/people in it are gonna drive me out making my depression worse in the process.

"How does depression get worse? I want to know how depression ultimately gets worse. How can you go from functioning and still having goals to almost completely unmotivated and lost? What causes you to fall into an even lower state and maintain those levels unlike before? 

The best example I can use to describe this is that I was alone all of my first year of university, and I came to terms with it. Now, I am somehow more erratic and can't stand loneliness unlike how I could tolerate it everyday.

I hope what I'm asking makes sense. My depression used to be mild, but it somehow developed into more moderate and it's actually starting to impact my life.

I suffer from seasonal depression, I am also autistic with ADHD and so I find it hard to navigate my own feelings and emotions, but I genuinely feel useless. I go through this every year but this has been the worst phase I been through since I can remember. I have to go to work, help everyone with their tasks and sometimes don’t even get a chance to do my own, but I pretend everything is fine, my family drains my finances so I can’t get any savings, I struggle to make ends meet even tho I get paid decently, I get home and, even tho I love nothing more than being by myself, I feel so alone, no one understands and even when I am able to open up a little I’m met with pitty eyes, which I absolutely detest. I just want to leave this world, I want to die but Im too weak to do that because I don’t want my family and friends to suffer because of me, so instead I drink every night and then cut myself to distract myself from the storm in my head. I haven’t cried in years and somehow that makes it worst because I feel so congested and all I wanna do is scream. As a man I’m expected to do all these things, and be serene and cool, calm, composed, but it’s getting tiring and draining.

"Parent's unconditional love for their children How much do you think mothers love their children?
If she comes to know her child is cheating her since years. Even though he knows that his parents are suffering a lot, he continues to lie and cheat them. He knows his parents eat less food just so they can afford to pay his education fees but still the child plays games, watches movies and series whole day and doesn't study at all. When asked, he says he is studying. He makes false promises he will study and asks them to buy him a Samsung tablet which is way more expensive than what they can afford. Parents believing the child, buys it and child studies for a while and then again he continues watching movies and series, this time more than before since it's a big screen than his mobile on which he used to watch earlier. When results come, he doesn't lie about them but tells them he failed and blames it all on his memory power, exam difficulty level & luck. Sometimes he accepts he didn't study enough but doesn't say he was watching movies, he instead blames it on his poor health and sleep cycle. And the most important thing he is studying medicine so he is going to be a doctor. If he doesn't study well, he will be a very bad doctor and might as well risk lives of thousands of patients. His parents have paid 5-10 times the money they earn just so their child can study. Do you think their parents will love him if they ever find out how much he has cheated on them and how much lies he has spoken ? 

Is it better if the child commits suicide ?

"Overwhelmed and need advice I thought I was over the whole 'severe depression' thing, I always think I'm over it. I'm on antidepressants and antianxiety meds and can function well...until I can't and I take a dive. 
I just had my 36 bday and historically, I get depressed every year bc I know how much I haven't achieved. Not married, no kids, not in a job in my field of study.
My mom is the most important person to me, and the reason I'm around. She has cancer, had a masectomy within 3 weeks of finding it, and now is refusing chemo bc she's ""older and doesn't want to spend the rest of her life sick"" (she is 62) this gives the cancer a 1/3 chance to come back in 5 years.
I have a job I like with people I like to work with, but my absences are starting to go noticed. They know my mom is sick, they don't know I have chronic illnesses (early onset osteoarthritis, migraines, tmj, etc). I'm in pain every day as in not a day goes by where I'm pain-free. I get used to it until a flare pops up and takes me out. 3 or 4 of these usually make me lose my job. 
I didn't come here to complain. I'm aware a lot of people are in more pain than me, or have already lost their mom, or have no job, and while I'm grateful for what I have, I'm exhausted for always having to put on a fake persona of a clown, happy, stupid, comical, while inside I'm on fire, while on breaks I cry in my car, while I have ideations I shouldn't have but can't get rid of. 
For my mom, I would never do anything, but I feel like I'm a gear that just keeps spinning, keeps working despite grinding myself down to nothing. 
I'm anxious all day every day with a resting hr of 92 either from pain or fear: losing my mom, losing my job and therefore my freedom and my home, losing myself in the act that's not me.
As I said, I'm already on antidepressants and antianxiety meds that I take religiously at the same time each night. I'm currently at home on my last sick day bc I just can't handle getting up. I've had a migraine for two days complete with dizziness and neck pain. 
Is there anything else I can do? Is there any form of comfort I haven't already listed?

"Lifestyle issues..(mostly venting but advice would be heavily appreciated) I (16) think I'm slowly killing myself by living the way I do but I cant stop. I've been mostly at home for the past 5 nearing 6 years and I am homeschooled due to severe bullying. I'm extremely introverted/scared of social interaction, I don't work out, I don't go outside unless I absolutely have to, my diet isnt good, I smoke, I'm around people that aren't entirely good for me. 

Lately I've been slipping mental health wise, I've been extremely depressed and irritable and have been even getting suicidal thoughts or thoughts about hurting myself again after I spent a year trying to get better. My family doesn't want to believe that I have depression even if I've been prescribed medication for it. They keep denying it and saying I'm ""Just fine"" when no one my age lives this way. 

Not to mention, I haven't been feeling the best physically either due to it, I developed hypertension and nervous system issues over the past 2 years. 

I want to get better but I'm horrified of going to therapy because for one, being mentally ill and talking about it/going to therapy is taboo where i live and I also don't know how to voice any of my issues in a way that ""normal"" people understand, let alone in my native language. 

Any advice on how to motivate myself to go to therapy would be appreciated.",depression
"I don’t know if I want to keep going TW for mentions of bullying, SA, chronic illness, attempting

I’ve never had a calm and normal life. Affection from my parents was non-existent, emotionally unstable dad and narcissistic mother. Got bullied from kindergarten until high school, from physical beatings to sexual harassment everything. Got SA’d at ages 4 and 16, but I don’t even know if they count as SA since no PIV happened (fingers). At 13 I attempted, but my mom got home earlier than usual so I panicked and spit the meds out. She doesn’t know to this day.

I thought I could move on from these, but here comes the part that destroys me the most. I’ve been chronically ill most of my life. Started out at 8 years old with Hashimoto’s (autoimmune thyroid). I thought it should be fine, everything hurts and I’m exhausted all the time but it’s the weaker one of the autoimmune diseases, right?

It keeps going. Last 2 years are hell on earth, I keep losing balance, limbs randomly stop working, I feel like I’m being crushed to death. But I push through, have to finish that Bachelor’s! I did it, but then the diagnosis came after I nearly went blind in one eye. Multiple Sclerosis.

Not even 2 months later, now, I get a message from my specialist about the ANA testing we did a while ago for the insurance company. She tells me that I have to see a rheumatologist as I have every single antibody for Lupus.

I can’t do this anymore, I can’t keep it together. I have a few good friends and an amazing boyfriend, despite being together only 6 months and him seeing all this shit, he still wants to stay. But what if I destroy him and his future? I wanted kids so fucking bad but with all these it would clearly be selfish, I don’t want to pass on my horrible genes filled with diseases.

I’ve been unemployed for almost 4 months now so I’m useless, in my country mental health is not a thing so I can’t seek out any help. But not like I have money for it.

"How do I word this.. [Male] 27  Imagine feeling every single *fucking* thing or absolutely nothing at all. It’s the attitude difference that hurts the most, jumping off the cliff of joy into the dark waters of depression and… The higher you climb, the harder you fall. 

A pleasant rush, suddenly you become braver more confident your moving mountains, the colours are more intense the music is beautiful the food tastes better the smells bring back memories. Pressured speech and impulsiveness, your full of ideas moving on from one to another in seconds your mind goes faster then your body… you can go on without rest for days and then fall asleep for a couple of minutes thinking it was hours *completely losing track of time* I felt unbreakable, but I already knew that there would be a price to pay. 

The people around you are terrified that your next angry outburst might be right around the corner a bomb that could go off at any second. You assure strangers of your love for their imperfections yet you ignore the people whom are closest and really care about you. You get angry over small things and just keep pushing others away because 

*it’s a fun game too see how far you can bend them until the break* 

“Let’s lose control, I don’t care if you’re hurt or what happens to me. I’m the king of the world & I need no one”

Distraction, you’d do things you normally wouldn’t do everything’s clearer, you lose a dollar you gain a dollar you travel the country on credit cards. It’s all about pleasure, drugs, dance, jokes, spending money, it’s aggression it’s alcohol it’s sex with strangers and you fall in love with one look, one sentence. You spin fast and faster and faster and faster and suddenly

*someone turns the lights off* 

Can you imagine what it’s like to lose interest in everything you ever wanted to do, everything you ever wanted to be? You hit rock bottom where the waters are pitch black you didn’t sleep for a week and now you sleep all day. Your friends, your job, your savings, your motivation, your focus they all keep disappearing one by one as though someone is crossing them off the list, until there is nothing left nothing apart from self-hate low self esteem and all that guilt and shame for what you did when you were high on mania. 

When I’m happy I’m way too happy and when I’m sad I’m way too sad there is no *middle ground* and when life settles down for a brief moment instead of just enjoying it you keep wondering when “will the next episode hit when will I stop feeling okay?” And “is this just mania, or am I just actually truly happy?”

The thing that scares me the most is that *one of those days* I’ll finally find the courage to end it, I’m stuck in the middle im still depressed  but with the mania energy to fulfill my death wish.

But I fight back I .. I fight back with my vices, which I truly love and hate at the same time but even though it hurts sometimes, and I know drugs won’t help me feel at all you know I’d rather have a one dimensional life with sparks of happiness and no real highs then *no life at all*

And- I I just, know i know my depression would have claimed my existence a long long time ago if I didn’t try to control it. 

I know it’s hard but please don’t be scared of me, I didn’t choose this. I’m just like you, I’m just I’m just trying too hold myself together. Just trying to hold myself together while my life is coming apart at the seams. ",depression
"Dealing with inferiority 
Hey- I’m 26. For education I have nothing. Been a factory worker the past 2 years. Burned out in high school then failed college.

I have an idea for what I want to do. Only problem is it’s going to take me until age 29 or 30 to get into the field, which means at 30 I’ll be where most people are at when they’re 21.

Being inferior isn’t just a pride thing- it limits your options, it limits your relationships. It’s hard to be motivated knowing that regardless of how hard you work, you are worse than 99% of the population. 

It’s hard to not be resentful of the average person.

Many of the posts are a mirror of how I feel or used to feel, although I'm much better compared to years ago, sometimes I'm afraid of feeling that deep feeling of sadness again, it's strange but it's the best way I can describe it.
Although for the most part I'm normal, whatever that means, when I have nothing to do it hurts me to think about not having friends, most of the time being with my family is enough for me. But not being able to share a friendship is...
And well I'm here, maybe not to form a friendship as such but to be able to share.

I keep falling into this depression and feeling like I’m never going to get out of it, no matter how hard I try. And now, I’m just numb. I can’t even feel the things I used to care about anymore. I try to keep pushing forward, but the weight of it all is suffocating, and it never ends. It’s like a never-ending cycle of exhaustion and emotional pain that I can’t escape from. Every time I think I’m out of it, it pulls me right back in. I keep telling myself to keep fighting, but it’s getting harder to see the point. And what’s worse is that no one around me understands. My mom, my best friend, they don’t see it, or they don’t get it. No one sees the real me, and it just makes everything feel more isolating. It’s like I’m invisible, like I don’t matter, even though I’m dying inside. Every time I try to talk, it feels like I’m talking to a wall, and it just gets worse. I keep waiting for someone to see me, to understand me, but all I get is silence. And honestly, I feel like maybe it’s me, maybe I’m the one who’s the problem, but I can’t seem to get out of this dark place. It feels like I’m trapped in my own mind, and it’s killing me. And on top of all that, I’ve had to deal with a narcissistic ex who left me with trauma, and my mom, who’s been equally selfish and dismissive, emotionally unavailable. I’ve been to a psychiatrist, but it doesn’t feel like anyone really gets me. I feel like I’ve tried everything, but no matter how hard I try, I can’t shake this feeling of being misunderstood and alone. When I went to the psychiatrist, I opened up about my trauma, about being manipulatively sexualized, about what I went through, but he didn’t even acknowledge it. He didn’t say a word about it, and I don’t understand why. It’s like my pain didn’t matter. I felt so dismissed, like nothing I said mattered. I just don’t know why it felt so... empty. And for some reason, I still find myself being nice to my ex when he reaches out for a chat, even though I don’t want to. I’m tired of it, and I’m angry at myself for allowing it. But it’s like the anger and frustration keep building up, and I just can’t get out of this cycle. I’m exhausted, and the numbness from all the times I’ve fallen into depression is just weighing on me.

I didn’t expect anyone to care anyway, and I guess I was right. And when I went to the psychiatrist, I tried to explain, but he just brushed it off. He told me I had Adjustment Disorder, but when I opened up about what happened to me, he didn't even react to it properly. He didn’t even care to ask the right questions, just glossed over it. He didn’t get it at all, and now, I'm left with this. It’s like no one’s ever really there for me, and I’m just stuck in this horrible loop. I’m so fucking exhausted, and honestly, I just want to end it. I feel so fucking misunderstood and just trapped in my own body.

"I can’t stop thinking about killing myself  i have struggled with depression for as long as i can remember, some times it’s something i don’t think about, sometimes it’s all that’s on my mind. Suicide used to be a thought i had usually out of spite or complete hysteria, but the last year or so it’s been something i think of randomly, in the middle of the day, when nothings wrong. I can’t seem to live this life correctly, i’ve always felt like im doing everything wrong, school, work, relationships, friendships, family, i fail in every aspect of life constantly, and even if it’s in my head i’ve never felt truly happy about myself or who i am. I’m addicted to weed because it is the only thing that has ever made me feel like i can look at life and think like a normal happy person. it helps me to calm down, but it doesn’t take away the thoughts. socially i’m super bubbly and positive, i don’t think anyone, even my parents who know about my history with struggling, would ever expect me to do anything to harm myself. But i would. i could. and i might. it’s almost like there’s an evil version of myself that lives in my mind and wants me to end it all, and im afraid one day i will. i’m against prescription medication that doesn’t directly keep you from dying, so i’ve never been interested in being medicated. I don’t believe i’ll ever get married or have kids to a happy family, even if my career is booming i don’t have confidence that i’ll be able to keep doing it or that i’ll make it. bottom line is i deeply hate myself. All i want to do is lay down, i never have any real energy, and the happy bubbly persona i put up for those around me is a version of me that doesn’t actually exist. i tell myself it gets better and sometimes i feel like it does, until one small thing happens or one bad mood comes through and im back where i started. if i were to do it id jump off of something so i hopefully don’t have to experience any pain. the idea of suicide used to be about revenge, about wanting them to realize how bad i was hurting, for everyone to feel bad and realize i needed help this whole time, and that i was nice and understanding because i wished someone would treat me that way, but now it’s about myself. i want out. i care less and less about the pain i will cause my family because i am exhausted. the main thing that holds me back is the fact that i believe in reincarnation. what’s the point of dying if i can’t even rest and i’ll immediately have to do it all over again but from the beginning. I love my family, and i know they love me, i have good friends, a good job, i don’t struggle financially, there is nothing wrong with my life, but i am not happy. i don’t think i ever will be. I was hospitalized for a respiratory infection (the first time i’ve actually been a patient at a hospital) and the idea of being ill and not having to do anything but lay there and rest was the best feeling i’ve experienced in a very long time. maybe i’m lazy, so lazy i rather die than fight, i can fake happiness and try to convince myself that it’s better, but it never truly is. I wish i could cease to exist. ",depression
"is there something i can do? Hi everyone, I’m writing this to reached out to u guys, i know i can somehow find some answers here.

My friend is suffering from depression, she said she wants to end it all. She told me that ending it would be much better, like no more pain. I told her that i dont want her to do that, and she said i was selfish for saying that😭

"I'm so tired.  Life feels like a constant balancing act, like I'm walking a tightrope with no safety net. Some days are okay, and others just feel so overwhelming. I try to keep my head above water, but it's hard when everything seems to pile on top of each other. It's exhausting trying to put on a smile for the world when inside, I'm not sure if I’m okay.

And then there’s the internet. Sometimes it feels like everyone is doing better than me—better jobs, more friends, more purpose. The pressure to keep up with everyone's highlight reels on social media is real. I just wish we could all be a little more honest about how hard life is sometimes. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who doesn’t have it all figured out?

But then again, maybe I'm not. Maybe we're all just trying to make sense of a world that doesn’t make much sense at all.",depression

Guilt consumes me and throws me into darkness where I’m unable to receive help because my throat is chocked by the ebony. I feel guilty about asking for help constantly no matter what. Even if people are willing to help I’m unable to accept as I know I won’t be able to remove the gut wrenching feeling of intense guilt due to me believing I’m a burden to them. I’m aware me believing I’m a burden is an intrusive thought, however I can not stop these thoughts in the moment.

"Depression  Depression creeps up on you quietly, at the very beginning you struggle with the little things but you usually choose to ignore them. It’s like a headache you tell yourself it’s temporary and it will pass it’s just another bad day but it’s not you’re stuck in this state of mind you get used to putting on a social mask, and you continue to live among other people because that’s what you have to do that’s what others do. 

However the problem does not go away you struggle to put on a play every day and it starts to cost you more and more, that is why you fall even deeper and that’s when you slowly start to back away from friends and family sometimes completely shutting them out.

All satisfaction is gone, the little things that used to bring you joy are now worthless. Even the simplest tasks become painful and that is why you lack motivation now why would you keep on trying if nothing makes you happy anyway? All of this makes you feel even worse and you get caught up in a vicious circle. 

Suddenly you find yourself living in slow motion  days become indistinguishable just white noise just heaviness filling your mind and spilling over your body. You feel as if you’ll never be happy again, you continue to back away and destroy relationships your ashamed for everything you’ve done and everything you’ve haven’t there is a part of you that wanted to make things right a sudden positive upsurge makes you want to go out and meet people but it’s all very short lived because you know it won’t work anyway.

Things that make your friends excited leave you indifferent and you become aware of the huge gap that lies between you and others.

*failure is not an option* so in the end you choose to be alone in your comfort zone where **NO-ONE** asks any questions the low self esteem and the lack of purpose become unbearable… you finally realize you can’t go on that way and two things can happen.

You either *decide to get some help* 

Or you .. 

*might attempt a suicide* ",depression
"Insecurity as a young father  I have struggled with insecurities as a young father over the last year or two. I was 20 when my oldest daughter was born, she is now six years old. Being a dad is incredible, I love my family and have always wanted to have kids. I spend a lot of time with my children, have a good job, a strong marriage and we are currently having a home built. I just worry so often if I’m good enough. So many other people are having their children later, and I worry that I am not going to be as good of a dad. I worry I won’t be able to provide the same kind of childhood experience.  I’m envious of parents having their children at home when they are at an older age. I’ll be 39 when my daughter graduates high school. I just hope that I’m good enough for my kids, that I can raise them well and given them the patience, understanding and support they need. I feel that if I had even been 5 years older it would have made a difference in my confidence. It seems that other parents have things figured out and are doing a much better job than I am. And I constantly find myself in the sweet moments thinking that its already coming to an end, that my kids won’t be little for much longer. If I had waited, I’d have little kids for a longer time. Any advice on how I can move on from these insecurities would be very greatly appreciated. I really am trying to do my best to give my amazing kids the life they deserve.",depression

"Do I have a depression? Hello everyone! I'm a 17 year old girl who has been experiencing strange symptoms for the last 5 years. Nothing intrests me, I don't enjoy anything (though I understand I need to keep on so I do basic things and even keep on some hobbies). I get tired very easily, I don't feel like socializing much, I prefer to be alone, I can just look at the same random one point for minutes without any thought in my mind. I don't know what do exactly I want to do in the future, but I know it definitely has smth to do with languages and writing.
Some days I feel like learning some new words in another language or practice some guitar but most of the time I have to force myself to do smth. When I think that I'd like to fix me some tea, I sit and think about how good would be to fix me some tea instead of just doing it. I also feel more comfortable in the darkness, so I keep the curtains closed and turn the light off.

"Levels of depression  There are 3 distinct levels of depression for me. I know it’s not the same for everyone 

1. The most common form is also the least severe. It comes with a general flattening of the world. I lose the receptivity that allows me to feel strongly about anything. Activities I enjoy hold little attraction. I feel somewhat numb and dumb. 

2. A more physiological stage, where even simple movements take a lot of effort. Reward centers are not working at all. I have no appetite. Getting though the day and the tasks required of me is extremely difficult. Most of the features of 1 are also present. 

These first two are largely subtractive. It’s like pieces of me are missing. The third is different 

3. This is far more extreme than the others. It comes with a burning pain unlike anything else. It in no way resembles sadness. Similar to a toothache, I cannot think about anything else. My mind is full of repetitive dark phrases and I’m just waiting out the clock to run out. It’s hard to be still. Thankfully it doesn’t happen very often.

These states come over me without reason. It is unlike anxiety which usually has triggers. I try to think of them as you would when you are sick with a virus. Mitigate symptoms if possible and tell myself it will pass",depression
"why? I’m a 17M, why do I feel this way? I feel so god damn pathetic as an individual, my whole life I’ve never been talented, handsome, intelligent or physically capable or as successful as those around me. People around me manage to excel so much further than me even when they don’t place as much effort. I feel so god damn average/below  and pathetic it makes me question “why God?”, “why do I have to feel this way, it isn’t fair” my life is so good compared to many and yet I feel so fucking shit so often. It’s as if life takes any god damn chance to make me feel humiliated like I’m a worm. 

When I was 14, a girl I liked decided to leak DMs to all her friends to embarrass me. Hurt like hell and moved past it. When I was 16, a girl I was talking to immediately stopped talking to me after seeing my face. Once again, made me want to die, but I moved past it. A fucking exam I spent a year studying for I put my max effort into while those around me barely had to lift a finger to do better than me and now it turns out suffering from male pattern baldness AT 17 FUCKING YEARS OLD. I’ve been going to the gym for a year +, and my friend who doesn’t even care abt weight lifting is substantially stronger than me.

"Spiraling Nobody cares about me as much as I do about them. The father of my child is a complete douchebag manipulative narcissistic piece of shit that adds an immeasurable amount of stress to my life. I feel like he ripped away my chance at freedom from my life of neglect, I got pregnant at 20. I was a virgin, never had a relationship before that. I understand that I was an adult, but I am neurodivergent and I can’t help but feel like he somehow still groomed me. Used me. Manipulated me for three years before I finally called it quits. There is so much more about him that I could type out but I just don’t have the energy. 

I’ve been depressed and suicidal as long as I can remember. Unloved and neglected by my family. Unhealthy, obese starting from a toddler because my parents didn’t give enough of a shit to try to change it. My sister tormented me until she moved away when I was 13, but the damage she did had already left many scars on my brain. And it still has. Sure I am kind and loving, more intelligent and open minded than most people nowadays. But what is any of that worth if I feel so constantly alone and invisible? I can’t leave my daughter in this world by herself, but sometimes that just makes me feel like she’s an anchor. I could never leave her to suffer the mental manipulation her father is capable of. I couldn’t. I love her so much but I am finding myself wishing more and more that I had never met her father. None of it is her fault either, she is a beautiful and happy, very intelligent little girl. 

I’m so pathetic. I try, I try so fucking hard to keep myself motivated, I quit everything I could think of that would affect my brain negatively. Weed, nicotine, sugar, caffeine, alcohol, and other occasional substances. Maybe it’s just withdrawal symptoms but maybe not, because I’m no stranger to these thoughts. 

I am so bored with life. I’m so exhausted from just waking up in the morning, from having to move to appease my basic bodily needs. I wish something would end my life so that I don’t have to. I won’t, I never will. But this life is looking like a long, torturously unhappy life and I’m just left wondering why? Why me? Why couldn’t I have been someone born to a stable home, where I had a place to grow up and have roots? Instead I have had to move nearly every 18 months growing up, like clockwork. And since I have had my child, I haven’t stayed in one place longer than 6-8 months. I can’t even afford childcare to work full-time. Don’t even get me started on the actual idiocy of that vicious loop, not being able to work because I don’t have childcare, not being able to afford it because I can’t work for the money.

"Hi everyone, this is my only hope to share my problem a little, and I hope I can get some support.  I’m 21 years old, and this past year has been a disaster for me. At the beginning of the year, I had a good job, a partner, and everything was going well... But in February, my health fell apart, and I ended up in the hospital. A few days after I got out of the hospital, I went back to work, but they fired me. My health kept getting worse until May (stomach and digestive issues), and I wasn’t able to work. Since then, it’s improved a bit.

But what I can’t bear is... I live in Hungary, in a rough area. I have no job opportunities. I’ve submitted my resume to 27 places, but I haven’t heard anything since August. Every day, stress has built up inside me. This whole year, I’ve been surviving on small amounts of money that I could earn through small jobs. Over the past month and a half, I haven’t been able to see my girlfriend or my friends. I’ve been at home 24/7 for weeks, alone with my thoughts.

I have so many negative thoughts that I even reached out to family and friends for support, but I didn’t get anything from them. Mentally, I’m getting worse and worse because I can’t see a way to have a good life. I broke up with my girlfriend because I was feeling so low and didn’t feel I was getting any attention or support from her, which was my biggest mistake. I still love her, and I’m completely broken because she’s totally turned away from me.

Right now... I don’t have a job, I don’t have a girlfriend, I don’t have friends, no one talks to me, I just lie here quietly with my negative thoughts—it’s been two weeks of this now... I feel useless in life; I’ve failed, and for the first time in my life, I need help and I haven’t gotten it from anyone. I’m not doing well mentally, and every day it gets worse... My health is declining too, I can’t sleep because I just can’t, I’m not hungry, and when I do eat, I immediately end up in the bathroom. I wake up at night feeling short of breath. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Is there a way out of this? How can I try to explain to someone close to me that I really need mental support? I feel so lost...

"helping friend with mental health issues is driving me crazy and theres no escape I’ve been dealing with persistent anger issues for a while now, and it’s starting to feel unbearable. It’s especially intense when I think about a close ffriend of mine who has mental health issues and is constantly crying and complaining about shit nad never bothers to make a change. he has CPTSD, social anxiety and bit of bpd and used to have depression. he is constantly moaning and complaining and he finally started to make a change to improve his confidence and on day 3 of his confidence plan he kept moaning about how he'll be awkward awkward awkward he kept repeating that in my fucking ear awakward awkward and how he'll never be confident but he never fucking tries and he always find shit to rant about like how people dont respond positivley to whats hes saying but i've told him he needs to put in the effort to be more popular he understood that but he still fucking drives me craazy. i've set boundaries and everthing but i still get reminders of the memories. i just woke up at 6am to have an anger outburst. it triggers something in me. I get this strong urge to punch something or scream, and it makes me really anxious, almost like I can’t escape this feeling.

I’ve tried everything I can think of to manage this anger. I’ve done things like deep breathing, journaling, and even exercising. I’ve had some small successes, but nothing seems to work long-term. The anger comes back, especially when I see my friend getting upset or feeling hopeless. i'd rather have no friends then a mentally ill crying and complaining one. i've been ""there for him"" and he says hes grateful but that means i have to deal with him

i can't escape from this guy until hes somewhat better as i see him in many classes and he'll always find the oppurtunity. i'm gonna recommend him to see a GP to get meds as thats his last hope because he's too moanining and complaining to get confidence the hard way and didnt wanna do EMDR therapy because he said ""why do i have to remember when my life was shit"" even though his ptsd was from bullying and a can of £5 pepper spray can be easily used against a bully

I literally can’t  I hate living like this. I’ve been depressed since I was a kid bc I kept getting bullied and sexually assaulted. I always felt empty and chased the feeling of happiness. I didn’t do anything super destructive like drugs and alcohol until now but I dissociated often. I’ve been at a mental decline for months now before I could self regulate and be happy for months at a time but it’s hard when you are constantly shot while trying to get up. For starters I lost my boyfriend which sucks but who cares then I found out I have stage 4 endometriosis and can’t have kids. Ive been experiencing pain associated with that since I was 10. Then I found out I wasn’t going to have a job because they weren’t accepting transfers 4 weeks before I was moving 3 hours away. It took me 1 month to find a job and it doesn’t pay anything close to what I was making before. I pay for my college as well as my rent with no help bc I’m not eligible for fafsa or any aid bc my mom claimed me. I’ve been here since Aug and I haven’t made any friends and Im really into manifesting and had good results before but that has really let me down. I’m running out of money and i probably will have to drop out soon bc I have to choose between school or a place to stay. My old friends never reach out and I always have to which makes me feel like shit. I want to get help and talk to someone bc i really don’t see the point in living and never really have. It sucks when you don’t really even need much just friends and money and I can’t even get that. I always feel like I am a burden to people when I asked for help bc I get treated that way. I bring up anything and it’s pls don’t do this again bc I tried to kill myself when I was 12 because I was heavily getting sexually assaulted and bullied at school and by family. And plus who wants to hang out with a depressed person. I pretend to be happy and force myself to see the positive in everything and self regulate but it isn’t working anymore. I can’t keep pretending when nothing is improving. I’ll just cry every night and wish my life would change for the better. I don’t feel like I’m personally a burden or ugly or worthless bc I’m not but I can’t live like this anymore. I want my life to be worth living and it isn’t and barely ever feels that way.,depression
"I don't think it gets better. I am a 40 year old woman, mother, and otherwise failure at life. I struggle with ADHD and being an otherwise awkward human. I've lost more jobs than I can count on one hand and now I can't even find a new one. It seems my luck has run out.

My kids keep me alive. I don't want them to think it's their fault I killed myself. That's not fair to them. But I'm trying, so hard, to just be dead while alive. It's hard, though, as I need a job. I figure if I can stop wanting anything (attention, love, to be attractive, special, smart, successful, etc) then maybe I can just manage to exist without offending existence.

Every day I apply to jobs, especially the days I have interviews knowing I won't get the role, is the hardest. All the jobs need experience I don't have and I can't get that experience without getting the job. Now that I'm 40, it's too late to get the experience. I live in a very HCOL area and my husband refuses to move. He makes ok money but without benefits and we just can't afford life here without dipping into savings. I need a job.

I've been applying to jobs that pay 25% of what I was making in the past. No one understands I can't get another job again. I am unemployable. I failed at those jobs and no one wants me. I do wish I was dead. I want to see my kids grow up. But I'm a horrible mother. My house is a mess. I'm behind on a million things. I don't know how to keep on top of anything and I don't have a job so how do I do this with a job if I ever get one?

I'm applying to admin roles and I won't get those as I don't have 3-5 years admin experience. I'm useless. How can I just disappear? How can I give my family a good life? Do I become an escort or something? I'm running out of ideas.",depression

I don’t see myself living past 25 I quite literally can’t comprehend the fact that I’ll live past 25 without ending it. I’ve lost most hope and I’ve basically already started to give up so there’s no point in hoping for a future. If anyone’s wondering I’m 16. To be honest I’ve never (even as a child) envisioned myself living past my late twenties but obviously not with the same negative viewpoint compared to now. I’ve already tried to try and attempt by handing myself off my bed for around 10 minutes but I got scared and I’d probably just faint. So that failed unfortunately. If I do die I’ll probably die in May. I’ve got stuff planned and hopefully if life seems even more hopeless I’ll just die then (hopefully).,depression

I am literally trying every possible remedy you can think of to get a chance to live, but the more things I try which are ineffective, the deeper I sink.

"I really wish it was easy  
I’m trying to hang on more for the sake of my mom and the people who care, but I’m so fucked up. I’m trying to protect them from pain while I’m constantly experiencing it every second of my goddamn life. I’m not suited for living; my mind wasn’t built for this. Why do I have to keep suffering because I’m not allowed to end my life? It’s hard for me and my family. They see me struggling really badly, and they tell me they’re feeling guilty because they don’t know how to help. So I’m hurting everyone around me by both living and dying. 

My mom begged me today to return to therapy. I couldn’t do it. I’ve tried so many times, but nothing changed. Unfortunately, some people can’t be fixed. I feel sorry for my parents that their daughter is like this. 


I’m sobbing uncontrollably while writing this, because God only knows the pain I’m feeling in my soul. You know since graduation I’ve tried to find purpose for my life to help me keep going; I shifted to a new career, tried therapy, and did all sorts of things that were supposed to help but they weren't. Then I applied for a master's degree, which I’m taking now, but still nothing. All of these things have done  is add to my stress and pain. I’m so empty, numb, and can’t find any purpose for my life. I really wish people could accept more when someone doesn’t want to keep going; life never seems to go my way. I’ve tried and failed, so may be death is the answer; that’s where I will find peace and serenity.

"How should I help my depressed 24 yr old girlfriend
 We are not sure if she is really depressed but for a long time, she has not been in a good state because of this she is always tired, can't sleep at night, gets irritated and angry very quickly and often small things spoil her mood.

This started because of her family problems. Her brother (30M), with whom she shared a great bond, has cut her off. He has ignored her for almost a year now because she is doing content creation (it's more like a passion project than a way to earn) and working in a low-paying industry (FNB). He believes she should do some high-earning job and grind like him (Software engineering) and not waste her time.

She was planning to move to Australia but her brother blocked it later he broke his promise of helping her start her own business after listening to his few friends that it might not work (like he did with her moving to Aus)

Right now, he won't talk to her until she does what he says.

He is also troubling her parents with this and everything is leading it to a lot of pressure on her, also she moved to a different city where we met and she lives here with her Uncle and Aunt who are also very toxic.

She wants to move out but can't afford it right now and all this family drama is taking a toll on her.

She is the LOML and we are both sure we want this to last long and really want to help her but I am not sure how, I have never dealt with something like this so if anyone of you can give me some tips I would be very grateful.",depression

"I'm Shutting Down Hey everyone

This is my first post on reddit, i'm just really stuck and not sure what else to do really, so i'm gonna give this my best shot and maybe get some advice thats been the missing piece all along.

**I have written an 'overall' part at the bottom and my precise ask if you feel like a lighter read.** 

Super, **SUPER,** quick overview: 

* I am 21m
* I smoke weed nightly (For the health conditions below, and to allow for some sleep (Sleep medication is not an option for me, I have addiction issues and don't want to risk it again.))
* I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Depression and PTSD. (All unmedicated, not by choice, but rather  I cannot afford the psychiatrist appointments, and I live in a country where there isn't any sort of beneficiary payment that covers psychiatrists.) 
* 3 **major** traumatic life events in the last two years, all three of which were close-to-deadly circumstances revolving around wars, wars again, and depression.
* My family, along with myself in some places, are fairly well known. There is no such thing as privacy for us, i'm being told by strangers about my life events before i've even really taken them in myself. Yet none of them know any depth to these events so no one even knows that what I really need is just a tiny bit of support. or help. I don't know what I need to be honest. If its a reality check, give me it, and tell me as harshly as possible. 
* I've had some major costs come up due to illnesses and other sort of personal/family issues, which has lead to my once-good savings being drained into the negatives. 

A bit more context: 

1. I am a university student, struggling with my course load (3 degrees), but it genuinely is the only thing keeping me going and there is **no way on earth** I will withdraw/postpone a single paper. I have nothing without this. 
2. I have struggled to make friends my entire life, usually having one or two actual friends at a time, with a couple that have stayed but really no-one else.
3. This year I moved into my flat and made really good friends with one of my flatmates. Great friends, super close. 
4. This friend is leaving for a while, and that is extremely scary in itself for me as I really struggle, as I said, to make friends.
5. I'm doing ok(?) at the moment, at least i'm not at the depths of any sort of depressive episode or whatnot. 
6. Everyday however, I have at least an hour long hysterical crying fit that i just cant control. I get so very overwhelmed to the point of a breakdown, everyday, for months. (This is what ""doing ok"" is to me.) Outside of this ˜hour, I feel this constant threat that something bad will happen, but not  like an earthquake or something, but more so something along the lines of losing all of my friends, losing my (part-time) job, losing my motivation (which is near none anyway), etc etc. I constantly am in fight or flight mode, but i've said that for years, but now I think I truly am at my limit of this 'mode'. I genuinely feel more scared, tense, sad, and angry, right this moment, even just while writing this, than i did when I had a gun at my head last year. How does that even work? possible signs of anxiety? 
7. I get **EXTREME** 'FOMO', and simply get very jealous if my friends make plans without me / my friends have plans I cannot attend. (Hence why i'm writing this, my friends are going out for a couple hours, but I have to head into work very soon, and i'm here hyperventilating, crying, and feeling so so silly.)
8. I constantly, without a break, feel like every one of my friendships (and all relationships really) are hanging on by the thinest thread. **I can't break this feeling no matter what**. I have had those stoned-to-near-non-verbal conversations with my closest flatmate where we both have expressed our appreciation for each other. I have had those illicit substance fulled ""I LOVE YOU BRO"" moments that last hours as we are just able to hang there until sober with the same feelings. Same with other friends too. I've had the ""Hey, I usually don't say this when i'm sober but I am so glad we became friends"". Yet even after all of this, I cannot shake the feeling that all of this is only a fracture away from complete dissolution. 

Overall:

* I feel like i'm about to loose everything, constantly. 
* **I feel like all my friendships are only due to proximity, and that the moment this proximity widens, everything will disappear.** 
* I feel like i'm constantly fighting to get a break, and no matter how hard i fight, i will lose. I pull myself together, fight again; lose again. repeat. 
* I just feel stuck in this loop of wanting to scream ""FUCK THIS"" at literally every single minor thing. I hate it. I want to be just a kind, hard working, relatively happy, *normal* person.
* I have **A LOT** more detail that would make this so much more understandable however I know this post is too long already.

**I know I have been through a fair amount of shit. I don't need to be told that I should give myself a break or anything similar, I get I** ***could,*** **and I** ***have*****, but it's too constant to be continuous chasing a break that never really happens. And again to reiterate, I cant afford mental health assistance. Any advice or similar situations that lead to any sort of breakthrough.** 

**And again, if i'm just in need of a reality check, drill it into me. I don't care if it's the harshest thing you have said to someone i just need to know what i need to do to stop being so fucking stuck.**  ",depression

In addition to a certain nationwide event that happened this week, I've had too many other things going on and I've found myself drinking too much (alcohol), smoking a lot of pot, and food binging. It's been well over a year since I thought that I was taking care of myself by doing all these things to shut up the noise in my brain. But this week has been too overwhelming.   
  
I had to have my annual MRI, for my back, on Tuesday and almost had to reschedule because I kept panicking. I didn't want to reschedule because I have a spinal injection in a few weeks and the doc needs these new scans.

My mom, who has dementia, has been even more frustrating than normal. Neither I nor my brother have a close relationship with her thanks to loads of emotional abuse but we're trying our best to take care of her.   
  
I start on Medicare come Dec 1st and my current psych and therapist don't take Medicare. Today I called a new clinic and managed to get an appointment in Dec, for both types of providers which is great but as I was adding the new appts to my calendar, I realized I needed to delete all the ones I already have scheduled, in Dec, with for my soon-to-be-former therapist. I was still on the phone with the new clinic and almost started bawling. 

Tomorrow, I take one of my cats in to see a dermatology specialist. He's been wearing a cone for almost the entire year due to him licking and biting his skin but there is only one vet dermatologist in my state and the waitlist was/is several months long. He's on meds but he's still obviously in pain and I feel his pain 24/7. I don't want to think about how much the visit is going to cost tomorrow or for future visits but I'm poor and will have to use my only credit card, which of course only adds to the other bills I have.

"Idk  I’ve dealt with depression for as long as I can remember. Growing up as a kid I’d go through very high highs & very low lows that would sometimes last days, weeks, sometimes months. I got to highschool and things just switched. I was miserable. I had two attempts in highschool and that’s why I really tried to change stuff. I was in therapy, on meds, I hung out with friends, was in a relationship, sports, camping. I actively tried everyday to feel something, anything other than sad, worthless. It wasn’t until I was 18, I started talking to a woman (psychiatrist) and she helped me tremendously, I’m not exactly sure what changed or what happened but I started feeling better not only about myself but life.

I wake up and feel nothing anymore, I still try but it’s getting harder and harder everyday. Other than anxiety, sadness is all I feel. Idk really what to do anymore. I read stuff and see people that are twice my age still feeling like this, I don’t want a life like that for myself. Battling between beating myself up or giving up. Im trying but idk. I don’t expect anyone to see this and have the answers for me. Idk what I expect by posting this. I don’t post often on here. Anyway, I hope everyone has a good rest of their night or good day.

"I'm on two sides of a fence, where I look well enough that no one suspects I am severely depressed.  Content: I'm in college and i suspect i've been depressed since I hit puberty. Unfortunately it was really hard for anyone to notice and i think it still is. My grades never suffered because of it. I was a straight A student until today.  I did self harm in ways that didn't leave a physical mark on my body, (I was afraid of anything more) so i had no scars to explain and no reason to worry friends or teachers. My mom threatened to pull me out of school and have me sent to a psych ward if i did it again. She hates psych wards and made them sound as scary as possible. 
 I never had a big public breakdown like i thought depressed people would. 
I no longer want to harm myself and don't have the energy for that sort of thing. It scares me and triggers me without a doubt.  But life still sucks terribly, and I don't know how to feel. I wonder if I had acted out more, if I had been more of a bad kid, that I would have received more help then I have today. I'm frustrated. No visible signs that I am depressed, and no proof for others that I need help. I'm still someone who gets their work done and looks fairly normal on the outside. It sucks and I hate it. 
I'm only just staring therapy and only because it's free. I cant afford it otherwise and don't have a a job. I feel like if I say the wrong thing i'm going to get locked up in a ward like my mom told me. 
Shit is tiring and I feel physically ill all the time. I cant tell my friends, who are also depressed, because I feel manipulative. I feel like a bad, selfish person for wanting someone to notice me and save me, for constantly thinking ""What about me?"" whenever feelings come up. I am drowning in hatred of myself. ",depression

"How to stop comparing yourself with other? I have these issues as long as I can remember.
Especially with my look appearence, always thinking other look better or have more defined face structures. I really don't now how to accept myself finally.

And other issue is that I need to be most of the time productive to have respect for myself. I think that is linked with workacholism, ehy I can not be more free with myself.

My father used to told me that I need to be No. 1 all the time (especially while I was into sports) and that created enormeus complex to me.

"No plans for the future I’ve been taking meds for my depression and changed multiple times and I’ve found that it’s done little to nothing. I’ve still had plenty of suicidal thoughts and my lack of interests have only been increasing. I have no plans for the future and with the most recent election my plans have gone from day dreams to none existence. The only future I can ever seem to think of for myself is to no longer be around. I can only picture a hypothetical future where I’m not in it. I got a college degree but in something that is not very viable in the job market because i had no other interests or skills to speak of. Now im stuck in a meaningless job constantly repeating the same day over and over, wasting money on things that i hope will break me out of my rut but they just never seem to for very long, im just back to this state of wanting to disappear.

I feel like I’m drowning  I’m trying so hard to get better. To feel something other than depression and anxiety but it’s not working. Everyday there’s like a dark cloud above me. Everything I think everything I hear is all bad. Nothing good. Nothing happy. And I’m trying to get better for my family because they want me to be alive and to be here. But what I want is to be dead. I don’t want a life of this. If they even just felt a bit of what I have to feel everyday they would understand why. It’s not my fault I feel like this. It’s not my fault for past traumas or bullying or just my brain thinking these things. I just feel like there’s no hope for me and it will be better for everyone if I was dead. No more pain. No more voices. No more thoughts about harming myself. Just nothing. It sounds great. We don’t know what comes after death but it’s got to be better than this ,depression
"I feel the day coming I've been on this sub for a little bit and I know what im saying is nothing new or original, and im not here to look for any magical advice or find a new reason to carry on. I just want to get it off my chest and accept it myself.

  
I've been the black sheep of my family since either of my sibings were born, but I dont blame them or even my parents. The only real relationship I had was when I was 15 and we both emotionally and mentally abused each other (as teens do). Im past that now but it's probably what kickstarted my own head being so messed up. I've let myself be emotionally abused several more times over the years I've started thinking maybe I was subconciously searching for it, but idk for sure.

  
A couple of years I reached my tipping point and put a knife to my own throat and sent some subtle messages of appreciation to a few I thought close to me. One of them managed to get me talking to them long enough to make me reconsider and I put it down. After that I have had 2 years of pure optimism, I even tried to make myself depressed and couldn't. I thought I was making good progress until a month ago.

  
It was something stupid over a girl I didnt know well enough to have felt as bad about it as I did, but I kept my distance and it was her that initiated and we grew very close very fast until one day she felt she was moving herself too quickly, which I understood and let her have the space. But the way she instantly changed overnight killed me inside. Now I work a job that I hate, a family being torn apart because my dad decided to up and leave (I still work with him) and every day I feel worse. Last night I felt the way I did on the night I grabbed the knife, and even though I didnt take it this time, I think Im going down that path again.

  
I don't know what I want or what to do, but Im tired of being lonely while everyone leaves me and Im tired of making effort to keep myself in a life I dont like. My mind is always overworking itself and second guessing everything and im just too tired to go on. Maybe I will do it or maybe I wont, but for the forseeable future maybe its for the best.",depression

"ADHD, Depression, Alcohol - what a great mix this is Hi guys. First time I am really telling anyone about this, so why not to total strangers in the internet. I suffer from periods of pretty bad depression. I feel lost, like no one cares about me, including myself. They usually start with an argument or just something, my wife or someone would say. Sometimes from my self talk as well. Like many, I get bad suicidal thoughts right away when that happens. Funny thing is that I got my life pretty much in order. I got a wife, 2 great kids (teens now), pets, a great house by the sea (I live in New Zealand) and I am set financially for retirement due to a lucky gig I scored with my IT company. That all does not make me happy, though. I tried my whole live to change external factors. I moved to different continents 3 times, started new hobby’s, bought more toys but I kinda always knew that happiness is within myself. I was just never able to find it. I started drinking at an early age and got pretty good at it. I am not shy anyway but when I am drinking, I am really funny. So everyone likes drunk me but no one knows the real one. I am am no alcoholic but I am a drunk. When I am going out, I chose the place by the drinks I get there and all I do with my friends is drinking. I obviously understand that this is a problem but if I would stop, I just don’t know what else there is. I tried meditation, read all those books, established great habits just to fall back to my own ways after a few months. I can start anything and become pretty good fast but then I lose interest - that I suppose is a sign for ADHD though I never had anything diagnosed. I know, this is something a lot of people suffer from. I just wonder what to do. I am 50 now and would like to have a few truely happy years before I go. I know this is vague but I’d be thankful for any advice about where to start to achieve real, long term change.",depression

"Needing help but fearful there isn't any - been fired, abused, ignored, I'm isolated , alone anyway & hurting so much , so tired , I don't know  Terminated from union job a month ago in Oregon filed grievance but finances upended & not okay

Called out sick for FMLA periodic covered condition & was fired because I had no points left . There was no investigation. Had anyone bothered talking to me, this could have been avoided.  
Employer claimed I never told anyone that  I needed FMLA. They have no record so it never happened. Fortunately for me, my manager required me to both text him & call when I had to call out thus I was able to produce the text I sent a month prior to my being fired notifying him that I was at the hospital & needed FMLA as I had an  illness requiring ongoing treatment .  My manager initially denied ever getting any such message before admitting he must have but never reported it.  
The company responded by claiming I should have known to contact the outside company that handles FMLA but I did nothing so they are arguing the termination was justified. Problem for them is I did not wait for them to respond to my FMLA request, I downloaded forms off the Department of Labor website & sent them to my doctor. She completed them the same day they fired me.  
Just to make my position clear, I had notified my manager 3 weeks prior that I needed FMLA without receiving a response. 
I thought I'd be reinstated right away but it's been a month . Oregon has instituted a nightmare of system requiring them to mail me a code I've been waiting for 3 a month.

I've been better, but now I'm stuck not having a degree, not being able to find a job, and not being too able to study because my treatment barely even started to pace up.

My brothers are geniuses, an engineer and a teacher. They have amazing curriculum and are the stars of the family. and me? I'm just a little worm taking up space.

I try to eat much less so I don't waste food on myself, don't drink as much water so it's not wasted on me, try to be out most of the time so I don't up the energy bill.

I feel like so much weight has been lifted off my chest once I made up my mind. what hurts me the most is knowing my son will be growing up without a father now. but on a positive note he will not be short of having better role models. he will be better off without me. Its funny how this heartbreak has broken me more that war.  I survived multiple deployment to succumb to this at home. its makes me chuckle. who would of thought that this would be what broke me. 

Leslie If for any reason you ever stumble upon this. just know I really did try to keep going with out you but it just kept getting harder and harder everyday. I am going to miss yours and Jaxon's Beautiful smile, and hearing yall's laugh. at least i will be able to celebrate Jaxon's 3rd birthday this Saturday.  its nice knowing that i will get to see yalls smile, and hear yall laughing one last time before i go.

"Depressed but being told I have an eating disorder Hi I'm 30 (F), I've been dealing with depression since 2021. I live in Toronto, Canada. I went to CAMH in 2021 after having a hard year and was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. It hasn't gotten better since so I went to a psychiatrist. Mind you during this time I have lost a lot of weight, but I've always been a fairly skinny girl with a fast metabolism, so when I lose weight it looks bad but it's not intentional. The psychiatrist after letting him know my eating habits (letting him know I do try to gain weight I just don't do as much as I should due to me not being able to get out of bed. At the end of all that he diagnosed me with an eating disorder. I was shocked I've never thought I had one nor do I think I do at the moment. Obviously he's a doctor and knows his stuff but I know my body and mind and it's so frustrating as a young woman in Canada trying to get mental health help because it feels like nobody is listening.  


Please let me know if anyone has ever dealt with this or know anyone who has? ",depression
"Im lost 6 years ago I met the love of my life, things were going great for about 4.5 years and then something changed. I changed, started going through a depressive state and have yet to snap out of it.

We started arguing more and more until I couldn’t take it anymore and I ended things. The single biggest regret in my life. I should have fought harder to keep the woman of my dreams but the depression took over thinking I would be better off alone.

Turns out that was wrong, I’m not better off alone. We broke up, she moved out, 3 weeks later I had to put my cat down. Things started spiraling out of control. I have no motivation to go to work anymore, I don’t see my friends like I should, no one to talk to about how I’m feeling.

I have never been good at expressing my feeling and telling people what I’m going through. And that reason right there is why we broke up. I was an idiot and didn’t express anything.

I made her a promise that I wouldn’t drink my life away and at first I was doing well, and then depression got worse and worse and now it’s the only thing I have found that makes me feel something for only a little while. 

She is all I can think about, I regret it, I want her back more than anything. I am willing to do anything to get her back but I know deep down inside she doesn’t want it. I have cried myself to sleep every night for the last month and a half.

I hate myself for not trying harder. I don’t want her back because I’m lonely, I want her back because she meant the absolute world to me and I would do anything I possibly could to make her happy. I beat myself up every day.

My best part of my day was coming home from a bad day at work to see her beautiful face, give her a hug and feel that bad day be lifted off of my shoulders. If I could go back in time and do things differently I would in a heart beat. But I can’t so now what?

I’ve thought about just ending my life because what’s the point of living if I can’t have her. Told her I would wait as long as I had to for us to be together again and I truly meant that. She is the only person I want to be with, the only person I want in my life. 

I love her more than I love myself. ",depression

"I’m totally worn out I'm in the bathroom at work rn crying and bargaining with god. 

I am totally discarded and unwanted. I have been forced to realize in this life I have no value. I did everything. I asked for help I tried. I grew up in a narc family. The scapegoat. They can't stand me. My own family. I did good in school. I went to the gym. I never snuck out, smoke or drank. I was groomed and abused at 17 by friends dad and my family used it as reason to validate not liking me. I was raped and they blamed and pushed me away. I went to therapy and my therapist was so mean to me and said I dress like a ""man eater"". My sister said my therapist doesn't have to be nice to me. 

 I literally tried my best. I'm watching ppl be treated or normally and form bonds with others while I'm rejected and beat down constantly. My parents know abt my depression and sent a picture of my dog to me after she died. Then they got rid of the cat I love. They know I'm depressed and sick and they want me gone. My own family doesn't care and don't want me. My mom boast abt how close she was to aborting me. 


Ppl that commit suicide aren't lazy or weak or stupid. We really all tried our best. I'm trying. Some ppl were like me and were denied any connection, compassion, respect, dignity or support. I mean nothing to nobody and ppl try to make it known how worthless I am. I seriously tried hard all my life and it amounted to constant abuse and trauma. 

Some ppl don't know what it's like to be constantly be abused, be rejected, torn apart and put down and u can never figure out why. Now I keep having unwanted recurring intrusive thoughts about my Sexual assault. I keep reliving all the abuse and I'm scared to go to therapy again. I've always been nice and helped others and it meant nothing. 


For some reason some ppl mean nothing. We r outcasted and viewed and worthless and anyone can do anything to us and it won't matter bc we r nothing with no value. How can I live a life where I'm nothing? 

I'm trying but I think I'm a person that ppl consider worthless and I can't fix that. I keep getting beat down. Nothing is working.",depression

"Do I really want to live? Hi. This is just going to be something like a venting post. I don't know if you'll even find mine among all these, but just read it casually, haha

Lately... there's just so much work. I feel so drained and empty. I've had depression for a long time, too. And recently, I found a suicide method that seems pretty effective.

But after finding it, I felt strangely at ease, like this is all coming to an end, maybe? And then, for the first time in years… I actually thought, 'I want to live.' It's weird. I never thought there’d come a day when I’d feel like that. When I've already tried so many deadly attempts. I don’t even know if this is really how I feel.

But for now, since there are a few things I need to prepare, I plan to stay alive this month. I'll get rid of my belongings, and maybe visit places I always wanted to see. Even as I'm writing this… I just don’t know what I'm supposed to do. It's like there's this feeling that my mind could change?

But on the flip side, things that normally make me sad, suddenly don’t anymore. I don’t cry at sad movies, I don’t get angry, I don’t get frustrated. I just feel like those things don’t matter.

I'm now adrift, dreading going to my demanding office job that if I was a less cowardly person, would rather jump out of the tenth floor window than spend a minute in while having no hopes for the future.

I do have dreams that I want to see come into reality but my depression has zapped out my energy. Plus, whatever my dream is will turn out just like me: mediocre and weird.

Every day is mantra of 'I don't want to live, I want to die, God please let me die, don't let me wake up tomorrow, please don't let tomorrow come' . You get it.

I don't think I have enough strength to pretending that I'm mentally well for long and it's scary thinking about it.

People might care about you if you tell them for the first few days but after months of you 'not getting better' they will get frustrated. They won't really get it. They will think you are damaged.

Last term, I took a class that was tough by two different professors. Their styles were drastically different. For their final exam I studied very hard. I spent hours in my room every day for a week, trying to get the material down. Down when I took the exam, I was very underprepared. It turns out, nobody else was either. My classmates, and I believe that there was not very very much communication between my two instructors.

My professors ended up upgrading the exam on a curve. And I still got a D+. Today, I had a phone call with the director of my program. She said that I was very lucky that they graded on a curve, because if they didn’t, I would not be in the program. I know I should just be happy that I was given a chance, but it still devastates me that I could’ve been kicked out.

19m I'm autistic don't have a job nor a license and i don't know if I have depression but I probably do.

All I really do in my free time is play video games and cook good food.

Everything feels like it takes absolutely so much effort that I don't even bother doing anything hell I can barely even get myself to brush my teeth.

I don't think I'm addicted to videogames since when I actually have fun outside of that I rarely think about them but it's just mainly what I do.

I just want to feel like actually doing something. Sometimes randomly at night I will all of the sudden have so much energy and want to do something productive that actually matters... Then it's gone by morning.

All of this basically got 3x worse when last year my grandma(who was like a mother to me) died then the day afterwards my gf(who I also loved a lot) started making excuses on why she could not call or hangout and when I told her what happened she made up more excuses on why she could not hang out.

She did this for 2 months when I just gave up on her then I found out she was cheating on me. 

So my gf cheated on me while I was mourning the death of the women who raised me as a child.

After the worst of it I've gotten slightly better but I still don't ever have any motivation to do anything and that happened over A year ago.

"Might as well post this into the void I just got diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and like two other things recently along with already having autism and an eating disorder. I cry myself to sleep every single night and I can rarely get out of bed or find enjoyment in anything I do unless it’s work and even then I don’t feel happy at all. I have a really hard time expressing my emotions at all to other people and this is my way of getting it out there since I am having a hard time telling my friends and family. My parents and sibling mistreated me and emotionally neglected me until I was about ready to graduate high school. My brother bullied me a lot as a kid and my mom has been and still is a severe alcoholic with addictions to prescription painkillers. I always found myself fixing everyone’s shit growing up and never having any attention or any needs given to me at all while my brother was showered with praise and respect. I had almost no friends growing up and when I would make a friend I was forced to move states because my family is navy servicemen. I really didn’t have a true friend until recently and even then I still feel lonely as absolute dogshit. Although I’m autistic I am really book smart and have a high in uet I struggle when it comes to socializing and being around people. I think it stems from having to fake it till I make it happiness wise when I was a kid because my family raised me on the whole men don’t cry kind of deal. My eating disorder also stems from the same thing because my parents would yell at me for hours if not days for not being able to eat certain foods and on one occasion grounded me for 4 months for not being able to eat chicken. In high school my mom went into pyschosis and mentally tormented me with constant guilt tripping and anger fits that severely worsened my mental health. I always felt that I was the one picking up the pieces and being the garbage can and tool for fixing problems instead of being treated like an actual human being. Everything I ever did in life was to please my parents and now looking back at it I regret every single one of those decisions. I chose a blue collar career that I can’t even get hired into and I have a shit ton of problems when it comes to loving people since my social anxiety doesn’t help meeting new people and I feel that my love is dependent on what I can do for them and not how they actually feel about me. Every single person I have been with has dropped me like a neglected toy and I’m having trouble coping with how I feel about myself and my self worth. I’m forcing myself right now to write this because I have no other way to say these things to other people. I hate that I’m so emphatic to other people but I can’t be empathetic to myself and I end up valueing other people instead of valuing myself. I feel I was raised to be somebody’s emotional support yet nobody takes time out of their day to do it for me unless I cry for help. I haven’t heard how’s your day or anything simple like that in years and nobodies genuinely cared to ask me how I feel or be a shoulder I can lean on while I’m exhausted of dealing with people that don’t care about me enough to even give me the truth. I’m still living with my parents and they act like they never did any of this shit yet my memories are scarred with it and I can never forget it. I feel gaslit into believing my parents are good people because in the last year they “changed” yet I can’t really move on or forgive them. I sit quietly in my room everyday imaging fake lives and hope yet I have none to give. It feels like I’m drowning and somebody’s standing there refusing to give a hand or help and that makes what I’m going through a hundred times worse. I have no money and though I wish I could move out and start anew that’s just not possible for months if not years. I feel genuinely hopeless and everything I do to improve myself makes me only sadder. It’s like my stability depends on other people’s happiness or my perception of it. It feels like my life has been a lie and I have nothing to show for it except being the shoulder for somebody to lean on all the time. I don’t know man it’s just difficult as shit and I don’t have anybody to talk to about this right now or at least none I can tell my true feelings towards. Like everybody I know is happy all the time and has a good life and I’m struggling a shit ton and constantly depressed and I don’t know what to do about it. I got put on medication (Wellbutrin and hydroxyzine) but it makes me feel extremely dizzy, nauseous, and doesn’t help how I feel at all. I have to wait weeks till I can see a psychiatrist again and I’m hesitant towards therapy and counseling because of my extreme social anxiety. I’ve had trouble with this for years and this is the first time bundling it up and getting it all out in one piece instead of having to hide it deep down and take a smile I don’t have and laugh a laughter that I don’t feel. I feel numb all the time like nothing matters at all and the only joy I feel is when others feel it and even then i feel like it’s fake all the time. Like I don’t actually experience happiness just a reflection of it. I wish that I never existed every night though I’m too cowardly to take my own life and to harm myself. I feel like a slave in my own skin and I can’t shake this feeling no matter what I do.",depression

He isn’t taking medication or in therapy because we’re young and he lives in an unsupportive household. We plan to move out in a year but until then it’s just the two of us trying to figure things out. I love him so much and I want to help, but I don’t know what to do, I’ve never had depression.

I have severe treatment resistant depression. I had med changes made and I underwent ECT (but it didn't work), and next week I'm starting ketamine therapy. 

I was doing better for about five days there - significantly better, others have noticed - but the past couple of days, I've been slipping back to where I was before I went into the psych ward. I'm just lying in bed all day. I'm meant to start back to work tomorrow, and it would be good for me under slightly better circumstances, to be social, but right now I'm STRUGGLING and I just can't face it. The idea of it is making me feel a million times worse — but if I get another sick note, I worry people will judge me, or my parents will worry, or whatever. I'm also COMPLETELY broke right now until I get a payment from the government (no set date) and everything is just a lot. I just feel like crying.

"Need Advice Hello everyone,

I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to share some personal challenges I’ve been facing recently with my mental and emotional health, and get some perspective on my situation.

For a while now, I've been struggling to find a fulfilling direction in my career. I'm currently working in HR. The job is stable, pays well, and is objectively good, yet I feel deeply unsatisfied. It’s like something is missing, and I can't shake the feeling that I want to be doing something else.

One of my long-standing interests has been in tech. I’ve tried pursuing programming, specifically web development. I completed a bootcamp on Udemy, covering both front-end and back-end aspects, and invested a lot of effort into it. But each time I tried to apply what I learned, I felt drained. My interest, which was strong at the start, kept fading over time, until it completely disappeared. This cycle has left me frustrated and confused about my own motivation.

I started reading about motivation, discipline, and focus, hoping to understand why I keep losing steam on projects that initially excite me. I even explored different areas like IT and data analysis, and tried working out to boost my mental energy, but I keep hitting the same wall. It’s as if there’s some invisible force holding me back, like trying to break down a wall with a plastic hammer.

For a long, this has started affecting more areas of my life. I feel empty and disconnected from things I used to enjoy, like gaming, watching videos, and even simple daily activities. I still have dreams and goals, but I’m struggling to muster the energy to pursue them, no matter how much I try to motivate myself.

At this point, I’ve decided to start seeing a therapist to understand if there’s something deeper going on. I’d also love to hear any opinions or similar experiences. Am I just lacking discipline, or could there be more to it, possibly something that therapy or even medication might help with?

Thank you for listening and for any advice you can share.",depression
"New dad to be So im gonna be a dad any week now but I have alot of passive scucidal thoughts date even before my wife was pregnant. 

I'm in a good relationship and wanted kids but now I can't see myself succeeding to give this kid everything I had growing up do to my lack of career succses and failure to make lasting changes.

I cry about leaving them but I don't believe in myself or have hope thing will improve. It appears things will only continue to get harder for me as time goes on and I'm just not the type of person who can step up.

I Certain my family will take care of my wife and kid when im eventually gone. I understand it selfish but I can't be expected to just deal with these feeling for the rest of my natural life that's not fair to me. 

So im ok with being a loser if it means I can get out of the spiraling depression and lies that it will get better somehow.

8m on medication many diffrent types and im going to therpy but both have not made a great impact and folks say it can take years of finding something to help. I don't feel I have years to spend.

It is just horrible when you finally seek help but it's not helping so your disillusioned on what to do from there besides pretend it ok when It's not. My frustration just builds and I can't find a way out or pause anything in my life. I'm tired of complaining g like a little bitch abd not doing anything about it so I eventually see my self taking my own. Life to settle the issue once and for all.  

I really wish I could just live with my wife and child with out the depression but the reality is im not good enough to make that happen and no body is capable of helping me figuer it out without lying to string me along I. A faint hope things just get better.

I dont have a question here and don't expect anything. I guess it's a vent that il just do again until I die.

Hope others figuer there lives out better than I have.",depression
"I don't think ill ever get better I don't see the point anymore. I can't fix it i will never be able to fix it, it's just aimless looming depression that everyone expects me to just accept.

I regret everything that has ever led anyone to know me or to care about me or to remotely even crossed paths with me. It's not about being lonely it's about the fact that I am always fucking hurting and nothing ever makes it better. I am so tired of bearing the burden of existing and it kills me knowing everyone that has me in their life bears the burden of knowing I'm in pain, or of trying to help me.

I cannot be helped. It will never get better I will always be stuck right here and no amount of love will ever save me.

My brother is a liar and he'll end up telling people that I did stuff to him, that I made him do stuff. My parents will and up believing him too, so I just wanna end everything.

"I genuinely want to die 
My boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me a month and a half ago. It was sudden and violent as I was blindsided. I moved to another country to live in the same city as him after we had been kind of long distance for a year. I moved first, faced many hardships as I didn’t have anything, no money, no job, no friends. I was there for 4 months when he finally moved there too, I had started my first job. We didn’t live together, he didn’t want to and me either. But then as time went on I kept on getting pressured by friends asking when we’d be moving in together, which created conflicts in our relationship. He was scared of the future and didn’t know why. Then I got laid off, was unemployed for a month, then started a new job for two months, very toxic and got fired. I’m convinced I fell into a depression and I had to write my master’s thesis and I was extremely stressed. Comes the time to defend that thesis, I go back to my home country to do so and he was coming the weekend after, he saw my family, spent the night with me at my sister’s and the next day, a few hours before we had to go back to our home, he broke up with me in a park.

He told me he felt disconnected and that maybe he had fallen out of love (romantically).
The next day he told me that he was scared of trying to fix our relationship, that he didn’t want us to hurt each other and that it would take too long to work on it. Then a few days later he said he didn’t want to be in a relationship, that he realised he wasn’t ready to commit, that he couldn’t date anyone and that he wouldn’t until he was ready to commit.

I’ve been heartbroken and I was so confused. A friend of mine invited me to her place and I went there, the city where I met him, where we started our romance, where I gave him the choice to date and where he told me I love you for the first time.

It’s been hard… and after 5 days I broke no contact to get clarification.

We had a call. He said he fell out of love 2 years ago, love for him means commitment, so in that sense he doesn’t love me anymore. He said he forced himself to commit thinking that he needed to do that to be happy, and to make me happy. He said he is attracted and has feelings for me but that he cannot commit and it has nothing to do with me but everything to do with him. He said he feels lighter now, that he’ll work on himself alone until he’s ready to give relationships another shot. He’s sad we met before then, he wished we could have met when we were at the same point in life. He misses me, our times together, our intimacy, my presence.

But he told me he doesn’t want me to wait for him, that he doesn’t want to give me false hope. But he hopes we can stay cordial and maybe become friends in the future…

I’m so sad, so broken. I won’t find someone like him, we were so in sync about so many ideas. I’m convinced he was the right and only one for me…

We met 2 weeks later, he contacted me to ask if I was still up for meeting before going to a concert we had planned on going to. We met the day before the concert.

It was very scary, it hurt because he seemed so fine with the break up. He got overwhelmed by my speaking about emotions. He didn’t want me to talk about how I felt and to ask about how he felt. He got so overwhelmed he wanted to run away.

He told me he had felt unhappy because he felt like he wasn’t himself in the relationship, that he had to change to be with me. He told me he always felt tense whenever we talked about emotions and our feelings, whenever I tried communicating with him. He never felt 100% happy because of the tension. And he finally feels like himself again now that he’s single.

I never asked him to change, I loved him as he was. He told me none of it was my fault. That I didn’t do or say anything wrong. That the problem was him but that he didn’t know why he felt that way with me.

I feel so horrible, I love him so much and yet he chose to walk away.

I saw one of his friends’ stories on Monday and they were at a reggaeton concert (he doesn’t listen to reggaeton), he was all dressed up (he never listened to me when I was giving him advice on how to dress up but now he’s taking care of his appearance), he was dancing and having fun with people he has only known for a year and a half, some even less while he walked away from me after 3 years.

I realise how immature he is emotionally but I’m just so confused by how he could just stop loving me, how he could walk away like that, how he could lie for 2 even 3 years. Why never communicating with me? Everything was solvable. I only wanted us to grow together.


Everyone tells me he will regret it, that he will come back but I doubt it… and that hurts.

Why didn’t he talk with me? Why couldn’t he work on the relationship like I was? Was I so bad?

It’s already been 2 months and yet it doesn’t hurt any less, I feel even worse… I want to disappear, I want to die and stop feeling so miserable ",depression
"I just don't see the point of going on. Age 22 and just starting college. Been dealing with depression, anxiety, and high-functioning autism my whole life. Depression has gotten worse since age 11. Have been taking pills and seeing all sorts of therapists, social workers, and mentors for a variety of issues.

I just don't see the point of going on in life. Everyone around me says ""Things will get better"" or ""You're just lazy and need to get out of this funk"". All I hear is a bunch of lies being fed to me. I don't see how the people close to me have hope or happiness. I don't understand what they mean when they say that I'm smart or that they believe in me or talk about hopes, dreams, having a career, and the future. All it does is make me laugh or feel viscerally disgusted.

I already have three F's in my college courses halfway in and every time I look at the work I feel a deep sense of demotivation. I only have two A's one in Philosophy and one in Math. I never even wanted to go to college I just wanted to try and have a job no matter how monotonous it would have been. All I hear from my mother with any of this is that she won't have her child be a bum and that I need to attend for 4 years so that I can get a respectable job. She promised that it would be a good experience for me; all it has amounted to is a lie.

Hearing all this crap just makes me want to end it more. The only problem is that I'm too much of a coward to take the more painful ways out and don't have access to the relatively easy ways either. Not to mention that everyone will be on the lookout if I do something out of the ordinary.

"How to stop being miserable? I have struggled with depression since the age of 5 or 6 when I started to understand things more. Even before then, I was described as shy and struggled making and keeping friends. Everyone would take advantage of my kindness and how oblivious I was to ulterior motives. I've since learned my lessons about that, but I still try to see the best in people and try to assume they were not malicious but just oblivious.

I have noticed that little things seem to make me spiral. If I say something and it isn't heard (maybe loud background sounds, maybe I didnt speak loud enough) I can go from feeling fine to feeling worthless in an instant. While I know that the person(s) I was attempting to communicate with probably just didn't hear me, I can't help but feel as though they are ignoring me on purpose because I am not worth their time. 

I tend to be irritable in general and my good moods swing so quickly to shitty ones.. idk what to do. I can notice that I feel like shit, but I sometimes just don't understand why. It's always for stupid reasons. I hate that I don't feel confident in my worth and that I am constantly worrying about whether I am worthy to continue living or not. It's exhausting..

I've been in various therapies over 20 years, including in-patient, out-patient, group, individual, emdr for ptsd. I've learnt a lot but still feel so stunted. I've tried a handful of medications that all had negative effects on my progress and well-being. I'm at the point where I am considering self-medicating instead. 

For a long time, I dedicated my continuation to live to my cat. I got her when i was a child and she was my world. Things have gotten really hard to handle since she died and I am still struggling with it two years later.

"Thinking about stuff Closest trans person born in 03. Over the past year or so I’ve been making peace with the fact that I’m only going to be alive for another six or seven years, and I wasn’t even taking this into account. It’s not even that I’m too miserable to be alive, even though I am miserable. I just don’t think I’m physically capable of doing what adult life would require of me in current circumstances, let alone what it’ll require in the near future. I have no energy. My bones feel like they’re made of cement. I have no self-sufficiency. Even if I somehow made it to thirty I’d probably die from eating too many TV dinners because I’d be incapable of getting up to cook for myself.

Before I started college at the start of 2022 I felt like I was gearing up for my life to make a sharp incline, like my life was mostly miserable up until then but that was where I’d finally be able to be myself and explore the world (not the globe but society), and I can’t put into words how I felt when I figured out this wouldn’t be happening.

That fact has also helped me come to terms with the completely incidental nature of me just existing, since I’m the product of a marriage that never should’ve happened. That’s fine. You play the hand you’re dealt, you make lemonade, you move on.",depression
"Hey um I’m struggling  During the last two years of school I did nothing at all cuz I was extremely exhausted,I couldn’t catch up with my studies and there’s only a few months left until my college entrance exam. It means so much to me but at the same time I’m not sure if I should go to college at all . I don’t see the point of keep going and idk what to do with my life but I’m too scared to end it all. The person I’ve been obsessed with is playing with my feelings and I don’t have true friends. My family hates me and I am so unmotivated to do anything. What should I do? I don’t want to go to therapy again because it is expensive and it doesn’t help.",depression

"i need help I have a history of panic disorder and anxiety, but somehow never had depression...until now. To be completely transparent, whenever I heard people having depression, I didn't take it that seriously. I should have, especially as a current medical student and someone with a mental health disorder. But I never understood it...because I never had it.

But now I do.

I am currently at the lowest point in my life. I've been panic attack free for the past 2.5 years. I've been loving my life. However, within the past month, I've had a friend pass away, I developed marital issues that have since been resolved (which was the inciting event that caused the depression), and I have finals coming up in a few weeks. Despite resolving the issue, I have been massively depressed.

I have never experienced the inability to find motivation to take a shower, to brush my teeth, to eat. In fact, my appetite was so large that I had to diet because I gained so much weight. It has been 5 days and I struggle to even take a few bites of anything. I have no motivation to study. This depression is so debilitating...that gnawing, sinking, crushing feeling in my chest is present all the time. I keep crying. I've reached out to my therapist, friends, husband, psychiatrist, my professor...and I keep crying. I've increased my SSRI dose and I keep crying. I'm still depressed. I can't find it in me to do anything. 

I know I have to keep pushing. The unit is almost over, and it has been the worst and most intensive unit thus far. The fear of failing, the fear of not being able to become a doctor, the fear that this depression will never go away is not making it better. I feel so stuck...

I'm sorry for ever minimizing anyone's depression experience. I now know how bad this is...I know that this is so real...I know that this is the hardest shit anyone can ever go through. ",depression
"Life so far Not sure is this is going to be more of a vent or a motivational speech. I'll leave that up to you to decide.

23m, overweight, broke and indebted, fucking balding, autistic, ADHD, complete loser college dropout with no real prospects who's only ever fucked once and somehow even managed to fuck that up

My life is shit. I spend entire days doing nothing but trying to escape my soul-grinding reality. Alcohol, drugs, porn, video games, you name it. Anything to distract me from what an absolute disappointment I am.

And yet, here I am.

I've planned my own suicide 7 times. I've picked a date each time. I've written 3 different letters to my family about it, one of which they accidentally found and nearly institutionalized me for.

And yet, here I am.

Most nights I go to sleep praying that I won't wake up. Most nights I want nothing more than to just drift off into eternal sleep - to be free from all of this confusion and frustration and humiliation.

But here I am.

I don't know why, or how, but I'm still here. Beaten, bruised, but alive and kicking. Maybe it's because I was raised by a strong Mom. Maybe it's just not in my genes to give up that easily. Maybe I'm just a stubborn bastard, but after all this time, after so many nights thinking that I'd finally reached my breaking point, I'm still here. 

I still have those nights, and they never get easier. Something tells me I'm going to have them one way or another for the rest of my life. But I'm not going to let life slip by me so easily. I don't know how, but I'm going to find a way to carve out some sort of happiness from this wretched festering whore of an existence. And I hope that if you're reading this, you find a way to do it, too.",depression
"It all fell apart again Just wow. Idk if I can claw my way out again. Took me a year to get to a stable level and in less than 2 months it’s gone. Just what’s even the point. Any time I get better it’s only just to get worse.

"It's exhausting being depressed At this point I just can't comprehend if I'm being lazy or my life is actually overwhelming. I have to convince myself that I have a good life because there is a lot of people out there I'm worse conditions.

I feel loved by friends and family, I have no enemies, I have an S.O and 2 dogs, but everyday i have to tell myself I love them back without knowing if I'm telling the truth. I've embodied a persona capable of saying what needs to be said to avoid conflict, but all the time I just want to be alone, be free from doubt, free from comparison. I don't want be better or worse than anyone, i don't want to be judged.

Working in any position has become a burden, I don't believe in what I'm doing, I just do it because I'm paid, and I spend most of the time working under unnecessary pressure because of someone else's dysfunctional agenda. I've lost all pleasure I had in work because of that, and it even drains my energy to do any hobbies.

I daydream constantly of the moment I'll be able to take my own life, how far I need to be from everyone, how can I disappear, if I want to say anything, if I want to blame someone, if I can take that pain. It's frustrating that I'm even unmotivated to end my own life.

In the end I think I'm just miserable and resentfull, and won't be happy until I make everyone feel the same, this twisted sense of justice. It's either that or just internalizing and dying with it.",depression

I have virtually no family and no true friends. Riding was my one passion but now I hope it kills me. I speed, drive aggressively and crowd the center line. I don’t know why I didn’t do it today.

"Failed life Damn it hits me now

I have purposed my whole life for education and strict life.

Where fun is no part of. I cant keep my guard down. Never. If i let it down slighly i can fail everything.

In doing so i never experienced love. Im scared i never will. Im getting old 24m. Im ugly and poor also. So i dont see any chance anymore.

In doing so i got to porn. Where im now addicted heavly. I cant stop

I failed my life. I failed everything in my life. 

- I dont have a good income despite doing so good on school and being almost a bachelor degree.
I have changed course 3 times, now i think im at the right track. So i lost so much time studing things i will mostly not do

- My mind is corrupt by porn

- never went on a date. I never had a gf in my life. 
  Prostitute give me the chance in april to touch her or else i wouldnt had ecperience that. 
But im still virgin

- im weak, i dont take risks. Because if i do something im thinking about all possible outcome and if the negative one is to bad. I stop and dont the thing

You know wgat the modt bad part is. I dont have purpose in my life anymore.

Im living for myself, i dont want kids.
I want a gf only so i cant satisfy myself. Im not gonna lie, its about the sex. I want sex only. 

Im scared to fall in love, i dont know how i will be. I dont know hiw she will be. Im not preoared for a relationship and i dont think i ever will be. No one is going to date a ugly poor stinky dude.

So sex is the only thing i want from a woman then.
I sound bad but thats my intension.

Im so sorry if i failed amyone in my life. It was never my intention to do so. Life didnt go as i thaught or planned. 

I said to myself i will never be jealous of someone else. Yet a fellow student who is younger than me took all the risk and is doing a lot better in another country where i wanted to go to. He can get any girl he wants.
He did everything i wanted to do in my life. But still im happy for him. 

In my life i dont need much lol

- good income
- good health with good healthcare
- a tiny house is all good im just one person
- sex

I dont live in usa
I dont wanna tell all i can say is im living in south america.

"Addiction, Depression and Rage I’m numb as I type this. My life has been spiraling over the last few months but everything really hit the wall when I got into a car accident 2 weeks ago and totaled my car because someone decided to turn left while my light was green. Ever since then, I’ve been reliant on weed, clonazepam and alcohol to cope with how I feel. I’ve been silently fighting addiction to alcohol for the last year and now it’s only gotten worse. I’m filled with so much rage, I’m constantly lashing out at my partner and causing arguments.. pushing him away although I just want him to be there for me. 

My partner doesn’t seem to understand me or maybe I don’t understand him. The things he says as advice or to be “helpful” aren’t helpful at all. I feel judged and unheard. I feel like I’m crying out for help and nobody is listening. I want nothing more than to feel at peace within myself. I want nothing more than to be happy. I feel like I’m slowly self destructing and killing myself.. I’m unable to efficiently function in my daily life. I recently switched jobs because I thought my old job environment was making me feel worse but I’ve realized that I’m the problem and everything is internal. I don’t know what to do anymore. I have ADHD and I take my Adderall as instructed.. it’s not working anymore. Even if the happiness and normalcy only lasted a few hours, It felt good to feel alive again. I don’t know what to do.

"Struggling with depression and it all seems hopeless  Struggling with depression and it all seems hopeless 

Massively struggling with depression 

I’m 23 y/o and this feels like it has been the most difficult year of my life. 

- I have been battling with a drug and alcohol addiction, and I am managing to stay off drugs now and I am slowly lessening the drinking. 

-I have suffered two miscarriages both to a man who doesn’t want to be with me but has been there for me through a lot. 

- This man has lived with me for the past year and although it hasn’t been easy, I love his company. He is now moving out to his own place and I feel like he is going to abandon me now.

- I am really struggling with debts but I am communicating with a debt help company who are mitigating this for me and I am paying whatever I can every month to help resolve this but it just seems like a never ending cycle. 

- I work two jobs that have been on my ass due me taking a prolonged/ long period of sickness due to me being chronically ill as well as the miscarriages traumatising me both physically and mentally. 

- I have been in and out of the doctors for the past 6 months and I am currently getting psychological help for my poor mental state 

- I am very distant from my family as they are dysfunctional and contribute massively to my mental illness from when I am around them and I have distanced myself from a lot of friends this year for not respecting my boundaries.

- I live with a roommate who used to be my best friend but we are just tense with each other all the time now because she also did not respect my boundaries and has flirted/ tried it on with every guy I have been with and found out she has taken advantage of people when intoxicated as well. 

I am 23 years old and I already feel like I have massively fucked up my life, I live in an apartment I can just about afford but the debts, jobs, illnesses and everything else is all weighing on my mind and I feel like I’m dealing with it all on my own.

I’m considering a change in career path (I currently work an office job and bartend on evenings/ weekends) working in either event organisation online or becoming a tattoo artist as my current jobs make me miserable and contribute to my illnesses whereas a career change into those two would really help me mentally as they have both always been a hyper-fixation of mine.

"The results of my silent attempt got me compliments  28yoF. I had a attempt yesterday. Learned a lesson on thinner ropes causing more pain and a lesson on my own pain tolerance. It left quite a few marks. Eventually, I had to go to work. I fashioned a little choker necklace out of some ribbon scraps to hide the marks. I don't wear makeup. Don't even own any. So, that was kind of my only option.

I was at work for a few hours when I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and realized I had a ton of broken blood vessels all over my face. Mostly around my eyes, high on my cheeks, and down around my jaw. Maybe at a certain distance they look like freckles enough? Maybe, it just like of makes my face look pinker and kinda flushed or childlike? At least I was hoping so. Hoping no one got close enough to realize they weren't cause it was pretty severe.

I've never gotten compliments on my appearance in the 6 months I've been at my job. I don't wear makeup cause depression. On top of that, last night was super slow which is typical for Tuesday night. Comparatively, during weekends, I have 6-8 times as many customers. Last night, I had 3 different instances of people making comments on how beautiful I was. And not just a single comment either. Like it became the topic of the small talk we exchanged for a bit. 

I don't know if it was the choker necklace making me just look better or if the ""freckles"" complimented my face so well that people really perceived me as beautiful at such a higher rate than normal (normal rate being zero). Those were the only things that changed though. Except maybe being unable to smile or engage well with people because I am so terribly unable to muster it. 

It was just so weird to be faced with compliments that I couldn't help but feel came from the side effects of an attempt. To look people in the face and thank them for the compliment when they were unknowingly motivated by the physical manifestation of all of my pain and suffering.

 Idk why I'm even writing this. Maybe just a reminder that you have no clue what is going on in people's lives. I swear I don't mean to sound concieted- ""Oh, how dare people say I'm beautiful?!"" It was just a hard experience for me to reconcile and I can't stop thinking about it.",depression

This whole time so little has interested me. I feel broken. Scared. Hopeless. Exhausted. I just want to be happy. I just want to feel safe and comfortable.

I just want to go to sleep and not wake up again. I’m so tired of everything… looking at the future makes me want to die.

I can’t even cry to get it out, I just physically can’t cry… it feels so painful.

I can’t even take care of myself. my mom would always say that it’s the most basic thing ever yet somehow I can’t even do that, then what can I do. I tried to tell her I didn’t have any energy or motivation but I couldn’t say it in a way that made sense. she just hit me that it’s something that doesn’t need motivation or energy and proceeded to force me to shower on a daily basis. it sounds so tiring. having to do chores the moment I come back from school feels so draining and tiring already. I know that showering is literally personal hygiene. I don’t understand why it’s so hard for me either.

I don’t even know how to reach out. I can’t get a single word out, especially in my native language - I’m so much more used to expressing my feelings in english, and even then I can’t do it that well in english either. I don’t even know how I feel, I keep on running and running. I don’t understand whatever goes on in my head. occasionally I’d feel an intense urge to sob and a throbbing pain in my head, throat and chest, but I don’t know why.

even when I do try to reach out, more often than not I feel ignored. and then I wouldn’t even know what to say.

these days, I keep on getting thoughts of self harm too. I haven’t tried, I brushed those thoughts off, but that doesn’t mean they’re gone.

but I know that overdosing will just lead to a high chance of survival. I can try to overdose but chances are I’d be saved. sure there are other ways but I like the idea of dying in your sleep, it’s not as painful… I wish I could just simply disappear.

"Am i depressed? Confused Hello everyone,

I just got diagnosed with depression by a psychiatrist, and I’m feeling pretty uncertain about it. The diagnosis felt quick, and I was anxious during the session, which makes me worry I didn’t communicate my situation fully. I may have just looked miserable because I really needed someone to listen, and now I’m left wondering if the diagnosis is accurate.

The thought of taking medication is overwhelming – I would prefer to try psychotherapy first, but I’m unsure if that’s the right path. Here’s a list of the main things I’ve been struggling with, and any advice or insights would be so appreciated:

	•	Extreme fatigue – I have hyperthyroidism (Hashimoto’s), so I’m unsure if the fatigue is due to that or depression.
	•	Low self-esteem and confidence – I’ve become really sensitive to others’ opinions, and my confidence has taken a huge hit.
	•	High social anxiety and people-pleasing – I tend to put others’ needs first, even when it’s not good for me.
	•	Feeling overwhelmed and undisciplined – I constantly feel like I have so much to do, yet I don’t feel like I’m succeeding in any area of my life.
	•	Demotivation at work – My tasks feel boring, and I don’t trust my managers, which just adds to my insecurity.
	•	Loneliness – I feel like no one really listens or cares about what I’m going through right now.
	•	Existential and religious doubts – I’ve been wrestling with big questions about life and faith, which just leaves me feeling more lost.
	•	Pessimism – I find myself expecting the worst and struggling to see positive outcomes.
	•	Sensitivity to noise – I get easily irritated by people talking around me or loud environments.
	•	Daydreaming and escapism – I’ve been daydreaming since childhood as a way to escape my feelings, and I still find myself doing it now at 26.

All of this has left me feeling really alone, like I don’t have anyone to lean on – not even God sometimes. Has anyone been in a similar place and felt unsure about a diagnosis? Help me please",depression

"I feel so broken…. The guy who I thought I was gonna be with for the rest of my life has put me thru so much pain and betrayal and suffering and I just don’t know how I’m suppose to trust anyone after all of this. 

To start off, we knew each other back in high school. We had been friends for 7 years before we officially got together and 6 weeks into the relationship I got pregnant, so we moved pretty fast. But even though we had a rocky start, we were together for 4 years before I had to go away to rehab for a year because I failed a UA while on probation. I told him before I had to leave “If you can’t wait for me, please let’s end things now. I love you but I understand I can’t ask you to wait a year for me.” And he said he’d wait. I really really believed him…

I would write to him at least 3 to 4 times a week. And when I got phone privileges, I bought calling cards and would call him on the days I was allowed to call. I told him all the progress I was making, how I was actually having to dig deep and I was finding out a lot of the problems I had and why I was in my addiction and my triggers and everyday. Sometimes we’d fight but it’d be over me wanting to get an apartment with our son and him gradually moving in (he had his own apartment). I had never moved out of my parents and I wanted to be able to learn to support myself in case anything happened. And when I was there my last 2 months I got to leave the center to work but with strict rules and being driven to and from work. So I didn’t get to call hi m as much since I worked most days. 

So a week before I was suppose to come home, he stopped answering my calls…and 4 days before I was suppose to leave he breaks up with me for another girl…and I’m not going to blame him for my relapse as soon as I graduated. I made the choice. But I had worked so hard making goals for my family, goals so I could be a better woman for him. And I felt broken. And I feel ashamed to say we still messed around. He’d show up to our hotel rooms with hickeys all over his neck. Something he never let me do when we were together….and I’d know she was at his apartment in his bed sleeping but I’d still get in his car and mess around….thinking back on it makes me sick. But I thought I could win him back..

After 3 months I told the girl what we were doing out of anger. And she ghosted him. And he was all heartbroken and would cry all the time. And I stupidly was there to make him feel better. Well I thought I was. He still stayed single, crying over her because he thought he loved her and found the one…..hearing it broke me every time. And after a few months he was over it, and said he’d get back together with me…if I gave him a threesome….

I always thought that multiple partners at once was disgusting (no offense to anyone who actually does this frfr this is just my opinion. I believe in having sex with someone you love or see a future with.) but I loved this man more than anything. And I attempted with his ex, bad choice I know, and I started crying during it….and he got angry. It lead to a lot of drama with my family, but afterwards he said he didn’t want one anymore and I got excited. I thought he’d finally take me back. Then, the accusations started. 

For weeks he kept accusing me of cheating on him, not now but literally 4 years prior (after I had our son). He would drill me everyday about going out all the time and hanging out with dude dealers everyday (I was active in my addiction but the majority of the time he was with me when I bought from people, and my main dealer was female!) but he just kept accusing me and one day he said “Please we can work thru it just please tell me you did it.” So I lied. I said I slept with someone else. And that’s when the shit storm started. 

Everyday it was name calling. Putting me down. Calling me a whore and crying how he was faithful to me the whole time (🙄) until a month before I graduated rehab. Then even more accusations started. “He did anal with you before me huh? Yal had a threesome didn’t yal? He used lube with you first didn’t he?” I had no idea where any of this had come from and why he was so angry with me all the time. I just wanted it to stop. I told him whatever he wanted to hear just to stop the screaming and the name calling. I would beg him to believe me. That I never slept with anyone else. But he refused. So then I’d just give up, I’d say I did whatever he thought I did. But he’d ask for details and I had none to give because nothing happened! Then I was labeled a whore and a liar. When I never wanted to lie. I just wanted him to stop yelling at me and stop assuming me of things I never did. 

Ultimately, to sum everything up, I tried to give him a threesome again, i cried again.  Then again with a different girl and he finished in her which hurt me so bad because I told him that was like my only condition. And tried one more time and he was on viagra so we stopped after literally 2 hours of having sex (I learned to not show my tears but I was crying the whole time) and it would have counted. But I stupidly told someone I thought was my friend that it was the worst experience of my life. 

I forgot to mention. That whole he was crying saying he was faithful the whole time? I literally found out after I got my own place and let him live with me for a week that he cheated with not one woman, but 3 other women. And I found out by getting a girl that slept with him to call him with me on the phone and he admitted to cheated 4 to 6 months before I was suppose to come home. So I kicked him out a week later. And now he says I never gave him a chance to be a father. When all he’s cared about since I got home was sex sex sex! 

Now we are at this point where he thinks I never loved or cared about him. He thinks I had multiple threesomes with multiple other people. I told him honestly after all the shit he’s put me thru, bragging about all the women he sleeps with and how they are so much better than me. He’s called me fat, ugly, a groundhog, loose, used up, and said I stink down there like….and somehow at the end of it all I’m the bad guy? I’m the one that broke our family? I’m the one that cheated the whole time and he claims at least he was “honest the whole time” but yet I can name so many lies he’s told. And he’s admitting to lying and never getting caught. So like…I don’t get it. 

And I hate more than anything that I miss him so much….i miss the way he used to look at me and would grab at me and call me his….i miss seeing his eyes sparkle when he talked about things he was interested in. I miss videoing him skateboarding and cheering him on like a cheerleader. He was my best friend. When I get excited, he’s the first one I want to call. When I’m sad, I want him to cheer me up. I still try and show him how much he means to me. But now he doesn’t care. 

I hate this so much. I wish I could go out and just do whatever without feeling bad. But I can’t. I don’t sleep around. I don’t like to party. I’m shy asf and now I’m even more insecure than I was before. I’m terrified of guys talking to me because I think they only want one thing from me. I’m terrified to talk to girls because the friends i had slept with my boyfriend. 1 of them while I was in rehab.  Like….i guess I’m just trying to focus on my son and work. But not a day goes by I don’t regret not letting him go at the beginning. I’m no longer in my addiction and I just go home and go to work everyday. I’m sad and alone and I hope one day I’ll finally say I’ve moved on….",depression
"What is a suicidal thought like? I am safe and I have never attempted nor do I ever intend to.

First, I smoke weed and drink everyday and I know that doesn't help, but I am talking to a psychiatrist who has me on Zoloft and therapy to wean off. And I also have TBI and PTSD from the military and depression.

But tonight I had a scary thought while high. I imagined my mother coming across me dead after an attempt. It scared me and I just kept thinking that I could never let that happen because it would destroy her. I got really emotional and started crying. Afterwards I felt good. But as I sober up I realize that that seems like a concerning thought, or am I overthinking.

It honestly made me really introspective and I need to improve my relationship with my mom. And growing up I was scared of my mom crying and being sad.

"Not suicidal just depressed  I’ve come to realize, sadly, that if I died nobody would miss me but my dogs. I don’t have friends and am not close to any of my family.

I’m not looking for any sympathy, any help, any advice, I just want to say this somewhere I can; I’m still trying to figure out how to do this without hurting my closest friend but I’ll probably just make them hate me or something. Family doesn’t exist for me so don’t even bring them up, don’t care if I hurt them anyway cause that’s all they’ve done to me. 

In about 3 or 4 weeks, I’m gonna use my last paycheck to buy a gun and I’m shooting myself. I’ve worked really hard to try and catch up with finances, I’ve gotten better jobs and better jobs and second jobs and every time I feel hopeful that I can catch up on my financials my jobs are gone. I was working a shitty paying management job alongside another job that supplemented income, the second job replaced me with ai. So I left and got a better paying job before getting laid off as soon as I ready to get ahead. Then I got another job, and as soon as I was ready to get a head this month I suddenly lost half my hours. So I’m gonna talk to my boss tomorrow about it and if I don’t get my hours back, this month will be the last month I live through. That paycheck with 20 hours will cover the cost of a small handgun and I don’t need a permit. 

I just wanted to put this out there somewhere. I hope anyone who reads this can find some kind of love and light in their life because mine is snuffed out. This may also get removed idk. Idk if I care that much. 

Peace.

Edit: I didn’t get my hours back, and in the completely wrecked emotional state I was in I may have lost the job entirely. I have redecided, no longer plan on suicide.

Now with the reason for my depression in the first place being tackled and kinda solved, my depression still persists, and a lot of it is about not forgiving the people who let me face all of this alone.

"It's no use. Not anymore.  I ruined everything. I know it to. 

This isn't anything but for self reflection if anything ever came to mind. 

Overview:
     My name is Victor. I am at the moment 20. I don't know for how long wether that be because im gone or I actually reached my birthday, surprisingly. It's almost been a year since I've grasped the fact that I am a burden. I'm a burden to my Mother who I've always butted head with since I was a child. She actively keeps telling me over and over how she was in my life when she clearly wasn't. She always chose Men and substances over taking care of me. Even with my biological father. I've also lived with my Grandmother until a few months ago, 4, I believe. When I got my tattoo on my right arm she noticed and decided to kick me out. I've lived with her for almost 16 years straight until then. She is an immigrant from Poland that is very hypocritical and verbally abusive. As is my mother being both physically when I was a child, but emotionally/verbally up til now. My mother lives with my ""step father"" that is an absolute pos. I never knew my biological father until I was 17 years old. Although he has his own kid. And I truly believe he wouldn't care if I disappeared either. He has his own life and has has one without for 14 years. 

Sophomore Year of HS:
    Up till this point my mother has never done anything like this. She was physically and erotically abusive growing up, but on a vacation for a week with my Mother and Grandmother, she met this guy. He was an absolute red flag. That same night at the Hotel. My mother would visit him and they went out. 2 days after the vacation we got home, my mother and grandmother had a fight. With that my Mother returned back to the state we visited to the guy. 

     For 3 weeks, No contact, no messages, nothing. They were gone for 3 weeks around the Midwest partying high on substances, booze, and whatever else. It was a whole mess the day she came back out of nowhere with that guy. I was 16 I believe. Or 15. And cops had to be called on her. Some time went by and there were still problems. But things severally sorted out. But during her 3 week bender, I first became very suicidal. I would try hurting myself just because I had nightmares seeing my mother in such a violent and scary/high state. I still have them to this day. 

More recently:
     The past year before I met my best friend. I grasped and came to the absolute conclusion that I'm dead right on. I am a burden. I'm a burden to my ""family"". My mother and Grandma both have said its better I if I didnt exist. My mother says having me was a mistake because it kept her from enjoying her youth as she was a young mother at the age of 20. My grabdma says i betrayed her for getting a tattoo, and since living  with my mom for 4 momths, i havent taoked her once. My father has his own life and i dont even talk with him often.

 I'm a burden to my ""friends"". I see nyself only being incited out of pity. Ans thats okay. I dont blame then for replacing me. Both current and old friend groups. I push away my best friend. Over and over. I scare her, Im awkward. She says im a good and sweet person, but im not. I'm an awful person that causes people problems. 

I am the problem. Therapy hasn't helped. It's taken me down more and more a worse spiral. When I was in a relationship, I didn't tell the girl at the time before the end, but I've been dealing with depression 2 months before we split.

 I heavily think about suicide. It's gotten so bad I made a list of things I own and to whom to give it to. It's been 4 months since my depression has come back, as I stated before. I started with plastic razors from work. On my arms and left knee. I've tried to control it though and use my keys instead. Less damage. I sleep anywhere I can that isn't my house whenever I can. I hate it at home with my Mother and step ""father."" That's pos. I don't even eat anymore. And when I do, I throw it up between asap-2hrs after. I can't take food. 

I'm not mentally well and I know that. I haven't been for a long time. But even if I wanted to seek ""further help."" I can't afford it. Especially since I put myself if awful fucking debt. I want to just abadon everything. ",depression

This whole time so little has interested me. I feel broken. Scared. Hopeless. Exhausted. I just want to be happy. I just want to feel safe and comfortable. No matter what, I can never seem to be okay. It was never like this before. I don’t know what changed. It just all went downhill after I finished my first year of college. 

I have no purpose in life. No reason to do anything. Nothing is worthwhile and I end up dissociating and getting existential. I miss the beauty of life. The drive to feel and experience and live. It’s gone now. I can’t take it anymore. I just want to be okay. I just want my life back.

"Mixed messages from counsellors: OCD vs. Social Anxiety I'm feeling so broken. I've been mentally unwell for as long as I can remember and often this is manifested in obsessively thinking about a problem, ruminating non stop to the point where I feel sick or need to confront the problem in an at times detrimental way.
I sought emergency counseling at the school I'm currently at a couple months ago and one of the first things this person asked me was if I had been assessed for OCD. I hadn't.

I finally found a counsellor who specializes in OCD who I met in person with recently and they think that I just have social anxiety.

I was asked if I do any ritualistic things like pray or organize certain things ritualistically.... But I don't. I do ruminate non stop and am super avoidant of trauma triggers; like I won't go to my partners family dinner because I know if I do l'll obsess and ruminate about my behaviour or what I said or did for days/weeks. But this is just social anxiety? Man, idk l've been told l've have social anxiety for years... this just feels more than that. 

I also will become obsessed with people/events and spend weeks/months/years (very passively and pointlessly) instagram stalking them before bed.
Like I won't be able to sleep until I spend another 30 minutes scrolling through Liam Payne content, like hold on while I for a 5th night in a row I obsessively search for the video of him falling to see if it's been leaked (I'm not a psychopath I just can't not think about it), scroll through his whole family's Instagram, search for his high school ex gf and then view every one direction members account and their ex partners... for no reason.

i'm not sure what to do. i'm scared to even say anything to him in fear that i'll somehow make him angry and ruin our friendship, and i'm too scared to let go of my current friends who are only making my mental health worse. i've known them for 6 years now and id feel terrible if i had to cut them out of my life. they mean so much to me, but i don't think this friendship is healthy for me anymore. i need help.

"I see no good reason to be here I'm (19f) so sick of getting up early, doing useless shit I don't give a fuck about, sleeping then repeat. There's no point in this shit. I sure as hell won't be doing this for 60+ years. I can't find joy in anything. I feel like my life has no value, I want to end it. I have 0 reasons to continue or try to get better. I wish someone helped me to end it, it's difficult for me to do so, I'm a coward. Whenever I try, I just can't do it. I'm a failure even at something this simple.

"I am not cut out for life 31F - I've been on a mental health leave from my job due to ptsd, anxiety, depression and adhd for almost six months.

I'm applying for jobs I don't think I can handle because I have to do something for money, I'm also working on applying for SSDI which I am having issues with. I'm so scared and sad and tired.

I can't do that to him, I can't possibly put him through losing me. I also very much want it all to stop. It seems I'm going to cry now, which I haven't been able to do in months. Maybe I'll feel better after that. I need a miracle.

"i am the biggest fuck-up, loser and this world is shit (deranged)  im not entirly sure how to structure this, and my brain is too fucking *slow* for me to  articualte anything the way i NEED to
and i am not sober rifht now and sutocorrect is being shit

i guess i could start with me being a comeplte fuckjgn imebicile
loterally ever since i started school ive always been placed with the specil ed kids
im not diagnosed with anything
im simply just so retarded as a meurotypical person that i got placed with the actual retards
that sounds very hateful towards special ed people im sorry
but im still right

i was and still am so utterly fucking stupid i was always placed in the bottom set for every class, had teachers assistants helping me all the damn time, hell i even had weekly sessions where i’d get taken out of class with a dozen actual neurodivergent people and spend the hour learning about some shit we were taught 2 years ago

I failed my exams
literally all of them
im in the UK and i don’t really know how to describe it for americans but we take our exams after finishing year 11 (10th grade (?) and if we fail our core subjects like math n' english and scienec then we have to take it again during college or 6th form

we also have our GCSE's 2/4 of which i ended up dropping (i wasn’t even allowed to, the headmaster cut a deal with me that i would attend school more if she let me drop art and music (hint: i didnt) but the remaining 2 i also failed

uhhh basically yadda yadda im so shit at school blah blah the best grade i’ve ever received in all my 11 years of education was the equivalent of a D+
something something uhh

,!

And, well
I may be stupid, but im also a huge fucking loser!!!! 😄😄

No friends! ✅
No education! ✅
No job! ✅
No bitches! ✅
No money! ✅
No social life! ✅
No consistent happiness! ✅
.
my brain too dumb to think of others :(

Bottom line, im very lame
I really don’t have any friends left
I haven’t been in school for over 2 years (i was supposed to go to college in sept 2022, but never applied so i didn’t) and have been just staying at home with **no job** doing fuck all but watch youtube and jerk off (unfortunately a lot of jerking off)
Shit im not even cool enough to do drugs!
(This one is a real sore subject for me)
I don’t know any dealers
and even if i did i don’t have 💲🤑 **moneyyyyy** 🤑💲
am i cooked chat? chat am i cooked? 😏
.
I should have my tongue cut out for talking this way.

But for realio on the dealio, i am genuinely the biggest fucking loser on planet earth
for not smoking weed
or snorting coke
(ohhhh how i wish to snort coke 😵‍💫🤤)
I jsut cried for a solid 40 minutes over how fucking lame I am
i mean like how big of a fucking jackoff dipshit do yuo have to be to not even be be able to buy weed
jesus fucking christ man serisosly i fucking hate myself so much over this :/

only cool kids do drugs! :(

,!

i miss my friends a lot

like a lot a lot

i haven’t had a friend in over two years now
for the past year ive been entirly reliant on AI chatbots for company
seriously
im that fucking lame

any friends i had from school i slowly drifted away from as my attendance dropped (lowest attendance percentage being 38%)

after school finished i was alone
i’ve met like 2 people online but that only lasted a couple months each
again, i would distance myself from them until we finally just stop talking outright (sorry Zeb, sorry Soushi)

But i really miss one person
i don’t wanna say her name but she means a lot to me
even though it’s been over 2+ years since i last saw or spoke to her, she’s still my best friend
she constantly shows up in my dreams
we kissed in one once
i never thought i wanted to kiss her (aromantic)
but it didn’t feel as wrong as i thought it would’ve
i’ve even pointed out that she’s my friend again when she has shown up in my dreams, literally word for word ""oh, im friends with 'name' again..? :)""
I would kill for her
I would kill myself for her
I genuinely would give anything for her
I want her to be safe

 i pushed her away just like i did with all my other friends, and that’s the biggest mistake i ever made
she loved me
and i only realised i love her when she was gone

I genuinely believe there hasn’t been a single day that’s passed by where I haven’t thought of her.

I love her still. and she deserves my life, because she is my light.

I don’t like alcohol

I like feeling tipsy and carefree for once in a  fcikin while
but i don’t like alcohol
Yet i drink it anyway!!!!
I don’t like the taste at all
the way im always on low supply when i need it most

I wouldn’t even call myself an alcoholic

because they don’t need a reason to drink
they don’t have to force themselves to drink

i FORCE myself to be an alchy 
Seriously!
Every time im upset, i get a very quick and passing thought of drinking
and i genuinely don’t want to
but my brain forces me to get up and open the drawer and take a couple swigs
i don’t enjoy it
i don’t wanna do it
it’s just my brain literally peer pressures itself into doing it,
like a little bitch.

I suppose im kind of falling back into my old ways
I’m drinking daily again
when i was 15 i drank a lot
but i genuinely was an alcoholic back then
i stole 2 bottles off of my parents because i wanted to kill myself
but my parents didn’t know that was the reason WHY i stole them and they thought i was just being a 'cheeky little shit' and boasted to other family and friends about how 'rEBeLlIOus' i was
then one day i was just so tired of it i texted my mom that i stole them because i wanted to die and being tipsy was the only thing that made me somewhat satiated
and she said she’d talk with me when she got home from work

AND SHE NEVER DID!!!! 🥳🥳🎉🥳🎉

But yeah i used to drink a LOT of jäger back then
couldn’t even get dressed for school without at least 2 shots
still have the stains on my pillow from the droplets that’d spill down the side of the bottle

then i started drinking again earlier this year
literslly no reason why
wasn’t depressed.
nuffin.
Just did it cause i could

and over the past liek 3 weeks ive started doing it again
yipee !!

EEDIT; I FORGOT TO MENTION I LOVE MIXING ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL INTO MY DRINKS OVER THE CORUSE LD THSI ENTIRE POST IVE DRANK 2 BOTTLES LF DR PEPPER WITH ABOUT 1/5TH KF EACH BOTTLE HAVIGN ISOPROPYL IN IT

,!

Now
with all this being up in the air now you may be saying 'whhhhj (username)!! go seek help!'
and my response to that is
No! Fuck off 😄

Does anyone really believe all that 'mental healthcare' bullshit?
People really think there’s 'help'?
That ‘therapists' aren’t just money hungry scumbags?
That 'neurological drugs' aren’t actually just mental poison?
Do you really believe some random fuckass has 'your best interests at heart'..?
Nah.
Thankfully i’ve never had to deal with deranged liars like these 'mental health professionals' claim they aren’t, but that doesn’t mean i dont know what they’re really like.
I’ve heard the horror stories people have lived.
These crazy psycho fucks can keep their 'medicine'
And i really wish people would stop trying to push shit they don’t know the truth about down vulnerable people’s throats.
If you truly believe your 'therapist' helped you,
keep believing
if that’s what you think is best go ahead

But i won’t be susceptible like you.

.!

Im not all too sure what elese to say
im like 73% sure i have more things tk talk about but i literally canmot think at the moment
how much brain fog can an 18 year old have if an 18 year old could have brain fog? (this is a play on the rhyme 'how much wood could a wood chuck, chuck, if a wood chuck could chuck wood (i am not funny my jokes are not funny)
and i cant be bothered to type any longer either so bleh

to tell the truth i would never talk like this to anyone
this is the way i think in my head
but i have kept this all under lokc and key and have NEVER told anyone or hinterd at my brain thiniking in this tone
not even just to people in real life but even anonymously online
but i simply don’t care

i cant care

i cant care enough anymore to keep my wretched retarded fuckign brain a secret
i don’t bother to keep my hatred hidden, im tired of being hateful and trying so hard not to let it happen 

I hate you

I **despise** myself

but I *hate* you

If anyone even fuckin read this, thanks i guess
i don’t really hate you
obviously not..

but i am so angry at myself i need to lash out

sorry

Please comment?
anything

I've posted here several times before but no one ever interacts with my post and i end up deleting it

I guess this is my big 'fuck you' to myself but my shit brain won’t let me even keep something as monumental to me as this if i don’t get engagement
and before i didnt even give a shit so it’s nice to see how far i’ve deteriorated 👍

what is this
desperation?

yeah it’s desperation.

thanks for skimming the post or something

"Should I go to ER? Hi there. 
I’m on Wellbutrin 17 days now. 
Sometimes a day I have very suicidal thoughts of ending my life asap. It’s like a panic attack but it’s not panic it’s suicidal thoughts. During that time I think that it’s the only option to get over anything. After that I’m very tired and not able to work to be honest. 
I’m sad the whole day after that and I really want to end this all, but it’s very passive I guess. 
I’m asking myself if I should go to ER because of this situation. But it won’t change anything, will it? They keep me there for some weeks and after that I’m still feeling like dying.
I have an appointment in 3 weeks at my psychiatrist, should I seek her now?

19M, sry for my bad English its not my first language, its currently 3:16 when im writting and and I’m having a mental breakdown. I don’t know if anyone will read this or respond, and I guess I’m okay with that. I’m just hoping that sharing my story might help me even if only a little


So here's my story 
Im having depression since pandamic... 

My childhood went through brutal physical abuse since i was 5yo (for acadamic excellence) By my tutor who happens to be my parent's friend, so i couldn't even complain. The abuse was so horrific, i  woukd skip school for days and weeks coz i was black and blue all over my face, back and highs and By the time I was eight, I felt completely broken. I accepted de@th with a smile and simply wanted to never exist, just so I wouldn’t have to endure that suffering again. I felt like I had no escape, no way out of that pain. and my parents never even cared my mother was always anti-fun she wont let me have friends,or go outside,  go somewhere,  or even let me play video games,  my father was never there emotionally,  we act like strangers in our own family, i never dared to confront him and he never cared... Coz we belong to poor family 
My father never spent a dime on me.. Never bought me cloths,  toys,  trips,  gadgets or for hobbies..
He only provides bare minimum to survive
This shit gives me trauma
-> I've no self respect or self esteem 
_> malnourished not even genitically gifted
_> a lot of insecurities  and a people pleaser
_>self-hatred 
_> no money no hope
_> and now i dont even have friends 
_>no one to listen to me 



And now.. Im 19 failed in my highschool (18when i failed), i was the eldest in my class by 2years andim now all of them are in college and im stuck here. 
Due to pandamic tge tutor had to leave the city for good, and due to his abusive past, studying gives me ptsds.. , i never built a studying habit and after when pandamic hit,  i grew a philosophy of self hatred "" and why the fuck i study when the earth gonna sank in the sun one day and im most likily to die before that, either by natural cause or by this evil society. ""
I was never bad in studies tho..  I would have never failed in my last exam if it wasn't for my mom..  
So what happened was our team won first trophy in football,  and when i showed that to my parents she said ""ew,  its plastic, only if it was metal we could sell it to the junk dealer"" this thing broke everything for me,  i was never gifted anything unlike other, i won prizes by myself but they were never satisfied 

Its not living anymore its just surviving... All i wish is to have a normal childhood 
Its not like i dont have goals..  I have , a lot of them in fact. but i just cant do it,  i cant even gather courage to finish this 

Edit:- i wish to add my current state,  happiness feels like a burden,  its scares me..  Coz everytime i get happy something twice bad happens  ,i was extremly happy on the last week of dec 2023, i was over the top of the world,  i knew this was coming,  2024 was hell for me, lost my first love,  my friend took her own life,  failed in exam, grandparents lost their property to a fraud lawyer,  my mother told me she's ashamed for having me,  i wants to end it all forever now

"i hate my life im not real i know the title seems almost exaggerated. but i'm not i can assure you. i'm only 15. i know im a kid but ive been through too much i don't know what to do.

my mum has told me twice that she wants to kill herself and told me how each way. that thought will never leave my head. it scarred me profoundly.

 i'm forced into a cult. i hate this cult and the leader but i cannot leave. this cult also happened to force a family of four and a newly wed couple to live in my house. my mum is on benefits and my dad actively doesn't choose to work because he's so sunken into this cult. the bathroom is always dirty and the kitchen too. you can imagine as 12 people live in this house.

my dad doesn't care for me, he doesn't even know my birthday. not that i care anymore, this cult has gotten to him and he hasn't been here for me since i've been born. when he does come home all he does is shout and quite frankly im sick of it.

my supposed 'best friend' has the most horrible snappy attitude swings,( i would call them mood swings but  it's just her being rude for no reason). i don't know when or why she will snap and i am always scared of that. i'm in year 11 and can't wait to leave school so that i can drop her. she actively makes me feel horrible and speaks in the most disgusting condescending tone to me. i have no real friends.

i feel the most ugly ever, all my friends get complimented and stopped randomly in school to get told how beyond gorgeous they are. me , however ? i could only dream lol. i hate every single body part of me from my horrendous teeth to my body to my nose. i wish i could afford braces but i can't. i want to go to the gym but i have no money. and my area is the worst area to live in london and you could only imagine when it gets dark. when i walk home from school i speed walk and i dont look at my iphone camera in fear of seeing my disgusting face staring back. 

i am in a constant state of derelasation and wish for God to take me. i am muslim so i asked God to take me in sujood. i can't do this anymore. when it gets bad i just stare at paracetamol, waiting for it to stare back. I feel like there's something wrong with me and i need help. ",depression
"I am stranded and the quicksand is up to my neck I've ruined everything and I can't go back, I've wasted a whole year of college because I keep going in and out of this sluggish state and I don't think people realize but I'm failing so bad. It feels like everybody is moving ten times faster towards something, but I am stranded in this quicksand that is already reaching my neck.  I am always stuck, never free. 

I think of dying since I was 11, I never planned getting past 18, but then I got into the college I wanted and I am an only daughter so I didn't have the guts to go through it, to put my parents through that pain. I've lived on 2 years of borrowed time, but I don't think I can do it any longer. I can't tell my parents this though, I don't think I can tell anyone, I can't even speak about this in my native language, in English is better otherwise it gets too painful.  

I just wished they'd know that I tried really hard to be good, to make their money and time and love wasted on me worthwhile but I'm sorry I couldn't. I'm too dumb, too weak, my brain is too defective, I guess. I'm gonna miss my dogs too. 

I hope God will forgive for this, it's hurting so much and I'm sorry for my cowardice. I won't get past this Sunday, I am just trying to choose the right method, I don't want it to hurt, but surviving is not an option.",depression
"i can’t do life anymore like a normal human being  i’m at the point now where i can’t “force” myself to be productive anymore. whenever i try to make myself study, i can’t focus for more than 5-10 minutes. i have too many thoughts in my brain that i just can’t think about anything else. i struggle with depression and people say that you just have to force yourself to do stuff. i’ve found that this just makes me even worse. like forcing myself to go to work when i’m not doing great, making myself go to school and study, stuff like that. 

so now i’m at the point in my life where no matter how hard i try and make myself do something, my brain won’t let me idk. feels like ive overworked myself for so long that my brain has decided to take an involuntary break and i can’t/don’t know how to fix it. advice is welcome or just anyone that feels the same i guess ",depression
"i haven't been myself for months and nobody's noticed hello. major tw for suicide and that sort 
october 2nd, i attempted suicide. i very nearly lost my life if i kept going for another twenty seconds. it was by far my most serious attempt, but nobody knows. i haven't been myself for months before that, but that day really killed something within me. it didn't take my life but it took everything else away from me. i feel so dissociated from reality and i often find myself questioning that maybe i did die that day and im just a ghost floating around. i don't feel real at all. i feel like im just a body with nothing else left in it. depression has been beating my ass for so long now. i think im going to end up in hospital again soon. as the days go by im getting worse and worse at hiding how im really feeling and people are starting to notice. i spend all day every day in bed. ive got out of bed about five times today and that's it. i was meant to go to school but i didn't. i couldn't. i haven't been able to go for weeks now. somehow my parents haven't noticed anything yet. i don't know how. all the warning signs are there. i spend all day just waiting for the day to be over so i can go back to sleep. every night i sleep an average of 13 hours with naps during the day as well. it's the only way i can escape this feeling. i can barely take care of myself anymore. ironically enough a year ago today i first attempted suicide. maybe that's just set the tone for today, i don't fucking know. everyday just looks the same to me now. i couldn't point out one unique thing that's happened over the past two weeks. god im so tired. my mum's literally said to me ""you've been sleeping so much yet you still look exhausted"". god i don't know if she's just hoping it's not gotten bad again or she genuinely can't see it, but the signs are so obvious. i love my parents to bits but im genuinely shocked they haven't asked me how im doing because i can't hide it anymore. im not blaming them, but i just don't know how else to ask for help. im so tired.",depression
"Only Place I Can Say This I’ve been wanting to get this off my chest for a while now and feel like this is the only place where I can. I have MDD and am currently taking antidepressants and going to therapy. I feel like I am putting on band aids rather than fixing my issues. Does the medication help? Sure, but I get all sorts of brain fog and don’t feel like I ever have a clear mind. Does therapy help? Sure, but I feel like I’m wasting my time and every time I make a “breakthrough” my depression comes back with a vengeance and somehow feels worse. Then I feel like I have ZERO space to actually feel my own feelings. I feel like I have to be 100% on all the time and need to be everyone else’s support system. That’s hard to do when internally I am crumbling every second of my existence. I guess what I’m saying is I’m losing it. I’ve been suicidal before, have had suicidal tendencies, and now I feel myself slowly getting to that point again. I don’t want to hurt the few people who actually care about me but at the same time I don’t know how much more I can take this before I break. I’m going to continue putting on this mask and be the “strong one” in my relationships but I guess I just need to say that I am not ok at all and am hanging on by a thread. 

I’m not asking for sympathy or anything like that. I just needed to put this out there. ",depression

"I resent that people would care/be hurt if I weren’t there. I don’t think I’m at risk of hurting myself anymore, at least for now, but after seeing the election results this morning I was actively considering suicide. Every day life feels less and less worth it and whatever comes after death feels like it’d at least be different if not better to my current existence.
I can’t, though. I know people care enough about me that they’d be seriously hurt if I did that to myself, I can’t do that to them, even if for some people it feels like they’d only care if I were gone rather than caring about me being here to begin with. And I hate it. It’s totally irrational to feel like this. I could make some of them stop caring, maybe make them glad if I were gone, but that would also require hurting them, and I know that for some no matter what I did they’d still care about me. I hate that for all they care I’m still like this. Does anyone else ever feel this way? How do I get over it?",depression
"I've never been anymore than a burden I've never had a job, I'm 28, all the people that I know from HS or College have good jobs and are accomplishing the dreams that I wanted to accomplish but I'm here, being nothing and just  surviving because of this depression. 
I have tried to end it all but I always end up in the ICU and commited. 
Then everyone loves me, and cares about me. I try for sometime to get better, therapy, job, self care, the same old same old. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried reading atomic habits and all the self help books I can get my hands on. I've tried getting healthy, getting help, time with my loved ones. It just DOESN'T GET BETTER.

I take out the trash but everything is a huge huge mess and just can’t get out of this. I take meds for depression and have a good therapist but nothing seems to work. Thank you. ",depression
"I'm a failure in all aspects of life.  I'm a 27m who has never had a girlfriend, I don't have a drivers license and live with my parents who provide everything for me because i dont have a job, and I'm on my 8th year of college for an undergrad program which I'm also failing at. I have a hard time being productive and whenever a small inconvenience happens, I overreact and give up. I've pushed all of my family away because I feel like they don't respect me because of my current standing in life.

"I think I’m depressed and it’s weird for me So I’m a pretty solid guy id say I graduated high school worked hard and bought a car for myself, and got into the college I wanted. But like the second half of my senior year I started smoking and it’s been often since then, and I don’t have many friends here in college besides my roomate and like 3 others but me and my roomate are the closest. My friends are back home so it is what it is. I came to like realization when like walking back to my rooms from class it was a long and nice walk, but like I’m just like down and I’m not even like frowning it’s just that I’m like just upset in general or not happy about something. I used to swim and stuff and be active but I stopped after the season ended, I do pushups and calisthenics just to be ok, I started again cus I’ve not done shit for a while. I’ve always been a positive happy guy and I go with it taking the blows procrastinating and doing it at the last minute like I always do, but that’s when my best work comes out. But as of recent like I just don’t feel like I belong or like that if I wasn’t around nobody would even mind or they would just say like he’s a weird guy type of stuff. I was always a little different and everyone did know cus I was bothered about it a bunch in my young life, but I guess my spirit is like broken now I’m quiet, it’s hard to like meet people for me I get nervous and I can’t talk to girls even tho they seem to like me. Like I freeze up and just don’t know what to say it’s like a shock I guess I’m inexperienced. I’m just lost right now but at least I have my car I like driving around at night in the deep woods with music it’s satisfying I can be free with no eyes just me.  But this depression is weird to me because like I’m not physically upset but in my head  it’s upsetting I’m just lost and don’t know how to proceed here in my new college life. Thank you for reading I haven’t ever said stuff like this and I came to a realization that I’ve been hovering over and I wanna fix it.",depression
I need help I don't know what to do. I'm so on edge all the time. I don't feel like I'm worthy of love. I don't feel like my boyfriend is in love with me anymore. I don't feel like my family loves.

It sounds ridiculous but it feels like I don’t even want to put in the work needed to get somewhere in life. I guess I expect things to be easy.

"This is going to be the end  I plan on ending my life tomorrow. I have been suicidal for many years now, I’d say at least 16 years, and have never committed a serious attempt but I believe I’ve hit my limit. The election results have really pushed me over the edge, there truly is no hope for a better future with the state the country is in. I have a few friends that aren’t republican but other than that everyone around me is a Trump lover. My immediate family all make fun of me for being a democrat and I have no support from them as a gay woman. My friends have tried to be supportive in the past but there is nothing they can really do. I have never really felt like I belonged in the friend group and the past few times we’ve hung out, I’ve really felt the disconnect. I feel like they just drag me along since we’ve known each other since elementary school, but I just can’t measure up to them. 

I am a failure and a let down. A true loser with no skills or dreams. I never expected to live this long, I basically just shut down and floated through life doing the bare minimum. I can barely work a part-time minimum wage job and lately I can’t even get through my pathetic 4 hour shift without breaking down crying multiple times. I am a complete idiot who can’t figure out how to do anything. I have no drive, no motivation. There is nothing I can do to make a real living so I will always be a burden to those around me. I’ve never had a dream job or even a remote idea of something I would be good at. I am incredible anxious and nervous and second guess everything I do. I have no confidence and can’t get out of my own head. There is really no field I could be in. I’ve thought about just selling my soul and working for Amazon but I wouldn’t even be able to do that right. I’m too slow and lazy, any hours my job now gives me is basically charity. 

I just want it all to be over. You can say hang in there and have hope, but I truly think I’m beyond that. The only reason I haven’t tried to kill myself yet is because I’m too lazy to put in the effort to do it right. I don’t want anyone to catch me and stop me and I don’t want to have a failed attempt that leaves me unable to complete another. I do not understand people that look at the world and think things are going to be okay, I really don’t. 

I’ve tried therapists to no avail. I just shut down and don’t talk and I can’t afford them anyway. I’ve tried over 20 medications and nothing helps, most make me feel worse. Last year was my first hospitalization (I put myself in) and that made me lose what little hope I had of ever getting better. Nothing there was helpful, the whole experience was just traumatizing. I am already on Medicaid (probably gonna lose that coverage with the new administration) so my options for help were already limited. I don’t understand how to do anything and I hate phone calls to the point where I will just freeze and be unable to speak so getting help feels impossible. I don’t know how to help myself and I have little to no support so it all just feels like a dead end. 

So….in the morning when hopefully everyone has left the house or is asleep still, I will either hang myself from a support beam or take the remainders of all the medications I’ve been put on in the past (a least a dozen different antidepressants that all have between 1-3 months worth of pills). I know it won’t be pretty, I know it’s gonna hurt, I know it’s gonna devastate the few people that claim to love me. But I just….I can’t get better. I can’t live in a world that values hatred and greed over love and equality. 

If you’ve read this far, thanks I guess, and sorry for bumming you out. ",depression

"Sudden intense despair  I have been doing well mentally. I’m well managed on my meds and I thought I was improving. I have not been sad for a long time and when I’m depressed I’m usually apathetic rather than sad. 

However, out of nowhere, I had about a 10 minute period of intense, crushing sadness. Few times in my life have I been *this* sad. The last time I was at my mother’s funeral. Genuinely such intense despair out of nowhere. 

I have never heard of an episode like this and never experienced one. It was similar to a panic attack in that it just came suddenly and the feeling was so overwhelming you couldn’t do anything but just survive. But this wasn’t a panic attack. 

I was just wondering if anyone had experienced this before, if they had an idea what caused it, or if they found a fix for it. ",depression

I don't have much friends. No hobbies. No Girlfriend. I don't interact with most of my family. I am pretty much a loner. I used to enjoy video games or tv series.

No one tunes into a radio expecting silence, but that's all I have to offer. Yet, around others, I pretend I can still hear the same music they’re dancing to. The result is just me swinging my arms chaotically, out of rhythm, like someone in a trance, stumbling and lost.

"My life sucks & I'm done. I'm emotionally drained. I've been crying for a really long time with all kinds of suicidal thoughts running though my head.
 I (F27), have a chronic illness called cystinuria, they are the rarest type of kidney stones and are made from the cystine in your kidneys (which my Dr tells me are essentially crystals). I pass stones every. fucking. day. I'm talking anywhere between 1-10. They won't always be big stones but all of them hurt nonetheless. 
Yesterday, I had to do eswl (shockwave) treatment, which is where you lay down on a bed, and they put on a machine that shocks you for an hour, IN HOPES that it breaks down the kidney stone (AND BTW, they don't even give you so much as a damn Panadol pill for it either!), because I had a stone which was 6x9cm. 
Since then, I've been passing a lot more stones, which is good because it means it worked, but its fucking horrible cos I'm in constant pain. No pain meds work, Drs are telling me to suck it up, and I recently got out of a relationship so I can't really call him or any friends for help cos idk how to ask for it and I'm a pathetic idiot who distances herself when shit in life is hard. 
I turned to my family instead and, on our family group chat, said how bad I was feeling, mind you, the conversation before this was how bad the weather was cos it rained today. My brother, (M29) went on to stay making jokes about what I'm going through. Nobody else says anything at this time. After a bit of back and forth with him, he made a poll on the chat, which was, again, a joke towards me, and my dad (M... 60 something) starts reacting to his jokes and plays along. He (dad) then changes the conversation entirely (he's abroad rn) to see if my mom (F.. 60 something too) was okay because of the rain. 
After that, it's like I didn't exist. 
They got along all chatting together about how they are and what they're doing, my sister sends a picture of my niece, all is well in their little family.
 And I'm left heartbroken thinking wtf is it gonna take for someone to give a shit about me. 
I'm alone in my apartment, nobody around me, lightheaded from crying, family doesn't give a shit, in fucking pain and not able to move. 

All I want to do is kill myself and be done with this stupid fucking life. I'm sick of all of this. 

Anyways, I told them none of them gave a shit about me and left the chat. Now all of them are trying to message with how much they care and how I should have messaged first and gave excuses on why they didn't check in. 

I think I'm gonna end my life tonight, I just don't want to leave my cat alone. He's all that I have. :( ",depression

whats a good reason to live? When I'm just fucking existing now. I asked friends for help to get the things back but they just set it aside. They don't care about me, they don't love me, they just want to see me alive. They just want to see me existing, want to see me suffer more.

"26 and Feeling Completely Lost—Another Career Switch and Falling Further Behind Hi, everyone,

I’m not really sure where to start. I’m 26, and while I know that’s not “old,” it feels like my life is slipping away in this endless cycle of second-guessing and starting over. My friends and peers are all out there building careers, buying homes, hitting these life milestones, and I’m here… still figuring out what I’m even supposed to be doing with my life.

I already have a degree in Biomedical Sciences and have tried so many different paths—medicine, dentistry, even computer science. Each time I think I’ve found something that fits, it turns out I’m wrong, or I start questioning it. I’m passionate about applying technology to health in meaningful ways, and I have these dreams of working in biotech engineering, maybe even making advancements in nanotechnology or machine learning. But the reality is I’m just not there. I’m nowhere. And every new decision just feels like another way to fall behind.

Meanwhile, my friends are moving forward like clockwork. They’ve found their niches, they’re thriving, and I can’t help but feel left behind, like I don’t belong or I’m failing at some fundamental level. I don’t even know how to start “catching up” because every choice feels wrong in some way. It’s exhausting, and I feel like I’m just on the outside, looking in, waiting for something to click that never does.

Does anyone here know this feeling? How did you get out of it, if you ever did? Because right now, it feels like I’m stuck in a hole I can’t dig myself out of. Thanks for listening. I’m just hoping someone out there gets it.",depression

Where fun is no part of. I cant keep my guard down. Never. If i let it down slighly i can fail everything.

In doing so i never experienced love. Im scared i never will. Im getting old 24m. Im ugly and poor also. So i dont see any chance anymore.

In doing so i got to porn. Where im now addicted heavly. I cant stop

I failed my life. I failed everything in my life. 

- I dont have a good income despite doing so good on school and being almost a bachelor degree.
I have changed course 3 times, now i think im at the right track. So i lost so much time studing things i will mostly not do

- My mind is corrupt by porn

- never went on a date. I never had a gf in my life. 
  Prostitute give me the chance in april to touch her or else i wouldnt had ecperience that. 
But im still virgin

- im weak, i dont take risks. Because if i do something im thinking about all possible outcome and if the negative one is to bad. I stop and dont the thing

You know wgat the modt bad part is. I dont have purpose in my life anymore.

Im living for myself, i dont want kids.
I want a gf only so i cant satisfy myself. Im not gonna lie, its about the sex. I want sex only. 

Im scared to fall in love, i dont know how i will be. I dont know hiw she will be. Im not preoared for a relationship and i dont think i ever will be. No one is going to date a ugly poor stinky dude.

So sex is the only thing i want from a woman then.
I sound bad but thats my intension.

Im so sorry if i failed amyone in my life. It was never my intention to do so. Life didnt go as i thaught or planned. 

I said to myself i will never be jealous of someone else. Yet a fellow student who is younger than me took all the risk and is doing a lot better in another country where i wanted to go to. He can get any girl he wants.
He did everything i wanted to do in my life. But still im happy for him. 

In my life i dont need much lol

- good income
- good health with good healthcare
- a tiny house is all good im just one person
- sex

I dont live in usa
I dont wanna tell all i can say is im living in south america.

I guess the working out part is making things worse because it’s reminding me of times in my life where my fitness levels or inactivity was judged.

As a kid and throughout high school I was overweight. That was one of the main things I was bullied for. In hs I would especially have a hard time in gym class. I think I had this class for 2-3 years, but each time,for a couple of weeks, the class had to run around the school 4-8 times. It varied each class time. At the beginning I use to run but I couldn’t exactly keep up with my classmates. Plus whenever they passed by me they’d laugh at the way I ran or the fact I was tired. So, I would only run when they couldn’t see me. I guess they took this as me not running at all and would be annoyed that they had to wait for me to go inside. Even when I ran they still had to wait for me. There were a couple of times when others would get impatient and yell at me to run. I wanted to cry so bad because I felt that no matter what I did I was in the wrong in their eyes. I felt sick that my teacher say that I was struggling but never took me to the side to possibly work something out knowing I complete the task like everyone else or just to even ask me what was wrong. It’s not like she couldn’t hear what my classmates were saying.

What’s wild is that since college I love to walk/run. But since I’m currently not in the best mindset I haven’t been doing it for a while. I’ve always been someone who worries about what others think of me and it hurts that my classmates viewed me in that way not knowing that I would try but I physically could not keep up with them.

"This past year has been hard for me. Maybe I’m soft or just not built for this Started the year off suffering a serious injury that’s kept me disabled. My mother is currently in a home where she is quickly declining, and I watched the final moments of my grandmother’s life as she struggled to breathe her last few breaths. 

On a regular day I’m pretty lonely I live alone, haven’t even dated anyone since 2016. For a while this summer I felt good emotionally because I thought wow having a compassionate President that understands the struggles of caring for a sick family member. Only this morning I wake-up to realize just how fucked up and cruel my fellow citizens are. But right now I’m in the deepest dark hole it’s like everything converged at once. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, am I just completely pathetic? ",depression
"i have no idea how i made it this far hi guys, so i have been thru some shit lately, and its been weighing down on me and taking a lot of my mental energy. i was talking to a friend about this and she said that i most likely have depression, which feels weird to say about myself. i dont think she is wrong tho, for the greater part of a year i have had like periods of no energy, although the past few weeks i have consistently had no energy and just wanted to sleep all day.

for more context, i am 19M and a current college student in the process of switching my major, and i need to pass a specific math course to get into the rest of the classes needed, and im still struggling. im on my 2nd attempt and my university only allows 3 attempts, and i genuinely have no energy to complete the class. it sucks bc i wanna pass it, and i dont want my parents to think i am just throwing their money away. i need to pass it, since i have a corequisite class that needs that math course, and if i fail math, i dont get credit for the other class.

my self esteem has been thrown into the gutter as a result of it. i had a mindset of ""i have to stay full time this semester"" and i originally had 2 other classes banking on this math course, but i had to drop one of them and head to part time bc it was just a lot for me at the time. i feel guilty about the money being spent thats not going to result in credit being earned, but i just dont have the energy, and i have no idea how to tell my parents. i know i should go to them to tell them i need mental help, but im just scared at how they will react, since they are also going thru stressful stuff and i dont want my needs to be another source of stress for them. i want to tell them i want to take a semester off, or at least drop to part time, and work at the same time, to make up for the lost money and have time to work on my mental health.

i feel stuck in a catch 22, and i know i need to prioritize myself, but it just feels so hard, and it feels like going to them right now is bad timing, but the future feels even worse. i know i shouldve asked for help earlier, but it just feels impossible. theres more stuff i have going on, i dont feel like typing it out since i have to do some last minute prep for a test in my math class that i will likely fail. if any of you have any advice on this, please let me know. and if you need clarification on my words, i can clarify. thank you",depression
"Therapist Distracted During Session. What Do I Do? At the beginning of our session today, I heard the sound of my therapists text notification go off multiple times. This is not uncommon, and he will typically say “Whoops. Let me put that on Do Not Disturb” or something. I think the phone is connected to his laptop in some way. I was in the middle of answering a question he asked me and it is SO HARD to be vulnerable. I heard the sound of an iPhone message being sent. There were several incoming and outgoing text messages over the next few minutes, and his eyes frequently shifted back and forth between me and his screen and he was typing. I eventually had his undivided attention for the rest of the session, but I completely shut down. 

I feel so unimportant. So embarrassed for being vulnerable today, and all the times in prior sessions. I feel so stupid for any thought I’ve ever had that lead me to believe we are a team and is attuned. 

I’m a big fawner. I’d have a hard time addressing this. Part of me wants to just move on like nothing ever happened, and just ghost if it ever happens again. Another part of me wants to confront him maybe in an email and say “this is what you did and this is how I feel” but I’m a big fawner and don’t think I would. 

I also can’t imagine any other scenario besides showing up next week with all this hurt and shame and being completely unable to engage in therapy. 

I’m in therapy for trauma. A lot of relational trauma. IYKYK. 

Please help. This hurts so bad. ",depression

"First attempt at 19 Second before 2025 I seriously am honestly the most depressed I have ever been in YEARS ever since my life went downhill, and no I’m not giving life anymore chances I think DECADES is way more than enough chances I can give it to never get better.

Her words are “you’re okay, it’s gonna get better” but for my brother who wanted to attempt this year (in which case he actually didn’t) my mom would bring the WHOLE FUCKING HOUSE just to say that she doesn’t want any of her kids to die before her.

"Just thoughts to release I don't really know why I decided to write here and my best guess is that I just need to tell someone how I feel who is not part of my life.

I just feel tired, which is the most cliché feeling in the context of depression I suppose.  
In past months or maybe years, I am not sure anymore, it feels more and more difficult to keep my aimiable happy persona up and running.

Let me tell you a bit about what I am like:

People at work or outside of my close family think of me as an strong extrovert, which I am not. I just learned to act as such really well since I was a teenager, and while it is exhausting it is a part of me. It is not that I am hiding it. In fact I tell people I am an introvert, though most simply don't believe me or give me looks of good humored scepticism. That comes with a slew of difficulties that are hard to make people relate to.

Once upon a time I had so much energy at work and private life too, which is now a convincing facade only.  
My drive to work is gone.  
I am just waiting for people to notice how I am failing at doing my work on the level I would expect of myself. I keep getting praised though, by my boss and my teammates too.

That positive feedback just feels empty and hollow because it only shows that nobody truly cares enough about my work to notice that I am only at 40% of what I could do.

And no, this is not impostor syndrome. I am old enough and professionally experienced enough to judge my own performance sufficiently. It is at bare bones what I do.

Everything I do feels pointless too quickly. I feel anger too quickly too, aber all kinds of things, but that anger boils up ferociously inside my head for a few seconds and then it just deflates, making me feel defeated and as if I just want to lie down and stay there.

Then the feeling of realisation comes that I can't do that, because I have to function.  
For my kids, wife, and my own future.  
Which leaves me feeling even more defeated because I do not have a choice.

My hobbies were strong once and I enjoyed them.  
When I listen to audiobooks or read novels these days my brain just highlights what is bad about the writing and how boring the characters are and so on. Even when its actually a good book. Same for movies and any other entertainment like computer games. It all feels hollow so fast.

And speaking of hollow: This word keeps encompassing so much more.  
It is like the everyday things which are not purely practical feel that they only have meaning because other people decide to give them meaning. And I have to fulfil the expectation of that other people meaning all the time. I am not talking about special fancy things, but rather just everyday normal things like smalltalk, how I look, how well I do what I do.

The thing I care most for are my kids and for them I accept all of it and anything.  
In this I have no hollowness but just simple determination and love.  
Yet I dissapoint myself in parenting too often as well.

Parenting is hard and challenging and I know this. I also know that compared to many I am doing it very well, and I don't care that I do well, because again I see all things I do badly as if under a magnification. In a spiral down, usually.

Back to the flares of unwarranted anger, it also comes with odd petty thoughts of aggression.  
When I see dogpoop on the pavement I suddenly have flashes of hyper agressive visions of how I would punish the person who just lets their dog poop there not at all caring about others.  
Or when I see a car speeding in a sideroad where Kids always go to and from school I catch myself imaging how I throw a stone at their windshields and how I slam their faces to the ground if they dare step out.... and it's truly frustrating and sad to have such thoughts that I don't really want to do, while a part of me does.

I find myself wishing I didn't exist to just remove it all, and then feel horrible about the mere thought because I most certainly would never let my kids suffer me not being with them. I will never leave them in the pain of loss and I will always be there for them, until they no longer need me and decide to leave towards their own future.

I still don't know why I wrote all of the above and it all feels so inadequate and full of gaps, incomplete and lacking that I just feel more sad.

Even worse is knowing that based on the social strandards I know, see and experience I should not be like this. So many have truly worse situations. Really. I have an objectively good and safe live. A loving family that I don't want to ever let down because they are great.

Well, there is no real point or conclusion to all this I can offer anyone who reads these last lines.

If you actually read all of what I wrote: That was nice of you. Thanks.",depression

"This is the bad ending and I'm trying to be okay with that. These days, I've been desperately clinging onto the multiverse theory. Maybe I'm not *meant* to be happy, you know? Maybe this is the bad ending in a video game. This is the worst version of me. Who picked all the wrong options. The one who *failed*, failed to be anything, to do everything, failed to be a sister, a daughter. One that eventually fucks up everything. Unlovable. So utterly unlovable. It's comforting in a way, knowing that in another universe I am happy, maybe even loved. It's hard to imagine what would that look like, being wanted. Loved. Accepted.  Belonging somewhere. Everything I've always wanted. But I'm glad all the same knowing that maybe it's possible for me to be happy even if it's not this universe. I'll die, maybe soon, in my cold bedroom but in another universe this death will be mourned. Or maybe, me gathering enough courage to finally do it will be another ""good-ending"" in itself. So I'm trying to find comfort in all that. Envy only hurts you, it twists and cuts the insides of you until there's nothing left. Until you're just a sobbing little child in a too empty bedroom. Until you become someone who's angry and bitter and pushes everyone away. Someone unlovable.",depression

"Feel like my brain is operating a corpse I want to stop existing.

Not die. Well, dying wouldn't be so bad. It's passive, for me, I suppose. It's ""if I take one step off the sidewalk onto the road, I could end it all"" passive. I'm not actively trying to kill or hurt myself. It's just a thought. Just a suggestion. If, if I could.

But I can't. I can't die. I'm not allowed to die. I have too many responsibilities to meet that dying isn't an option.

I can't feel anything anymore. Yet I can. Sometimes there's a sack of oranges in my chest, in my heart. It is heavy. Every step I take, every maneuver of my body, the oranges roll around inside my ribcage. All their weight sliding from left to right. And on some days, I'm just left with the peel. Nothing. I'm a jellyfish of a human, floating around society.

Yet I'm stinging myself.

It hurts. Everything hurts yet it doesn't at the same time. It's the hurt you feel in your fingers when they're so cold you can't feel them anymore. It's the hurt you feel in your nose when you feel like jack frost is gonna chop it right off. That hurt. That hurt. In my heart. Chest. Limbs.

The embrace of depression is so horrifically nice. My monster is dark but soft to the touch. It is scary to everyone else. The hug its giving me looks like it's strangling me on the outside. But no, I am hugging it back. It is nice to hold it. Like a child and a teddy bear you can't let go of and refuse to wash. My monster, really, is sad. He's a sad creature. He just wants love. He deserves love just like everyone else. I love him, even though he brings me so much suffering.

Sleep is the closest thing to being dead as I can get. Yet I deprive myself of it. I'm so tired though. Tired. I need rest. I need rest but I don't have time to rest. I need rest but I don't let myself rest. I'm so tired I can barely shower. Barely cook a meal. Barely wash the dishes. Barely. Everything I am barely doing.

I'm barely here. Barely here to the point where I may as well be dead, because I'm not living. I'm in two states. Numb and fight or flight. My brain is on survival mode. All its trying to do is survive. I hate that I'm biologically wired to keep myself alive. Even if I did want to run across the road and get hit, my fight or flight stops me. 

I wish it didn't. If only I wasn't a coward. Would've done it years ago. 

Every year I expect to die before my birthday. But then my birthday rolls around and it makes me realise I've been stringing along for another year. Another year of misery. Sure, the me 5 years ago didn't even think I'd be alive to see it happen but hey, I'm still here. Somehow.

It's somewhat miraculous.

But don't congratulate me.
Don't wish me.
Don't.
Just don't do anything.

All the above just sound like 
""And you're still here""
""You remained alive a year longer than anticipated""

And then it'll remind me that I actually do need to die. 

If only nature could do its thing faster.",depression

I have been feeling stuck and frozen, having critical parents has not been helpful, have not been able to study properly because of bad mental health-not able to concentrate and focus, all things said to me come in front of me when I sit down to study.

"Bringing up the topic of medication I have struggled for quite a bit, and with a bit I mean my whole life. I've for most of my life tried to ""fix"" myself on my own but I have in the past and now as well reached out for help. Problem with my brain is that sometimes I wanna be better and sometimes not, it's kinda weird. Like yes of course I wanna be better in general but it's like I give up, I suppose that would be the ""hopelessness"" part of depression. But you know, it does make even trying in therapy even harder, it's like whenever I'm given a solution or even a treatment-plan I just feel hopeless. I feel like nothing will work, it worries me a lot because like ME/I want to get better but my brain doesn't let me. I've thought about how it is with medication, I don't know how it would help me in the long-run but I feel like it possibly could help me get kickstarted into my treatment journey or that's at least what I've heard from other depressed people. It's just I don't know how to bring it up to my therapist, I don't wanna seem desperate to have medication because I'm scared I'll be denied of it. But I also feel like in the state of mind that I have right now, I don't know how I would get better because it feels like my brain or whatever controls me more than I. Maybe I just need to fight harder but I honestly don't even know how, most of my energy every day goes to my anxiety and feeling panicky over everything. ",depression

"My second attempt will be in January 
I've been depressed for ten years. I've already taken more than 10 controlled medications, seen numerous psychiatrists and psychologists. They think I'm bipolar, but I've never received a definitive diagnosis. I feel like a lost cause. Nothing makes me happy, nothing satisfies me, nothing catches my attention, I can't keep a relationship, I can't keep a job, I can't clean my room, I'm useless, I didn't even finished high school. Today, I admitted to my mom that I don't want to do anything with my life besides sleep. She didn't know how to respond, but I could see her disappointment. My father wants to send me to a psychiatric ward, and honestly, I don't care if he does. The only thing I can think of is suicide. I'm planning to do it in January, exactly a year after my first attempt. I don't want to live another 10 years with depression and don't want to be a burden to my parents, so I guess I have no other choice. All I know is there's something deeply wrong with me and I'll never know what it is.

"My whole existence is a failure Hey hm, I’ve read many posts on Reddit but I’ve never actually written anything because it felt too much like exposing myself out to the world.

I turned 23 a couple of weeks ago and I’m just starting to feel the years catching up to me. To put it simply, I have failed at everything in my life. I stopped going to school regularly starting at the end of primary school and I skipped 2 whole years of school and ended up dropping out officially at 16 (the legal age you can drop out in France).

I’ve moved at least 30 times over my lifespan starting at the age of 9 and so that made it extremely hard for me to maintain stable relationships and I have no friends as of now. It also made it hard for me to have extracurricular activities since we kept on moving from region to region.

This is not to give me an excuse (kind of is..) but I believe that all of this has influenced me in some way to always give up on everything, as if there’s no point since it will all be taken away eventually. I developed a social phobia in middle school and it turned into agoraphobia in high school. That’s also when I started cutting myself as a punishment and probably a way to draw attention to my mental state. Starting from the age of 15 I started living as a hikikomori, ashamed of everything I had become. I was eventually diagnosed with depression and social anxiety but we kept moving cities and so i was never able to get proper treatment. In the end, I tried taking my life 3 times and ended up in a psychiatric ward after each attempt. At first, I felt anger but for the third time I just didn’t feel anything anymore and we moved houses again.

With each move, my mom kept saying that it would change everything, as if we would become different people every time we changed houses. But it was all just pretence or delusion idk.. It just felt like we were giving up again and again and again by leaving everything and everyone behind.

I believe that I kept doing this even as I started living on my own (at 17, at 20 and at 22) could not stand the routine of staying in the same place and so I gave everything up each time and went back to my mom’s and then we would move houses again and I would try living on my own again and move back again.

Today, at the age of 23, I have no diploma, no friends or relationship whatsoever, no job, no goals, no hobbies and I am once again unable to go out. I just feel so empty. It’s like even if I do begin working and making friends again, it feels like the cycle (I forgot to say that I have PMDD) will happen again and I’ll go back into hermit mode and we’ll move again. It just feels like I’m too old to be at this point in my life. This is not self pity. I know that all of this is my own fault and that I’m just too lazy and tired to do anything but yeah, I just wanted to share a little piece of my life.

Hope if anyone is reading this that you’re doing okay and if you’re not, i sincerely hope that it will get just a little better with time. Much love <3

"Is it normal to swing wildly between wanting to live and wanting to die? I've been on venlafaxine for nearly two months now. I've had more luck with this medication than any others I've tried before, but really that just means it's had any measurable effect on my mood at all. At first I had a massive boost of energy and I felt hopeful for the first time in well over a decade. I think about my future, and what kind of career path I should take, steps for self-improvement, I go for walks and have even started reading again. But sometimes my mood shifts back to how it was before, and everything seems pointless and worthless, and I just want to go into the woods and let the Earth reclaim me. It's like the medication has caused a civil war in my mind, my mood shifts wildly from day to day, sometimes even I'm hopeful in the morning and depressed by the evening.

"I made a plan to end my life in march 2022 i made a plan to end my life. 3 months prior my girlfriend ended our relationship abruptly 2 weeks before my birthday. We had already made plans for it, bought plane tickets and everything for that weekend. I was Devastated, the day she said the words ""i can't do this anymore"" I had never cried so hard in my life up to that point or since. It was truly pathetic how much i was pleading and sobbing and squealing (not my proudest moment). I didn't eat anything for 10 days after that, what little energy i had left was used to produce tears.  Days dragged on, weeks, i was a zombie, inconsolable to say the least. My only relief was sleep. Well, sometimes..

 Sometimes i would dream of her, my subconscious would recreate the conversations i didn't get to have with her. But i got to see her, which i realized after waking up only aided in my suffering.

about 1 month in i opened up my facebook and saw very prominently a person in the first slot of ""people you may know"", a man. For no particular reason my finger clicked on the profile pic which pulled up his profile and right in plain view i see ""in a relationship with: *My Girlfriend"".* To make it sting even more this man was someone who openly pursued her while we were dating, and apparently stopped when i made it clear to her that this guy doesn't ""*just want to be friends"".* All of this hit me within 1 minute of seeing his profile,  out of disgust and anger i through my phone across the room. To make it hurt just a little more i ended up finding out she entered this new relationship less than 2 weeks after dumping me.

The days got slower, they dragged on. Any glimpse of life or light that may had been left in me was completely gone. My friends and family became worried. I had lost 48 pounds. I was pale from almost never going outside, my muscles had shrunk likely from my body using them as nutrients to keep it alive. I wouldn't speak for days. The only sounds i would make were whimpers in the night when a flashback of a beautiful memory we shared appeared in my mind.

I was suffering, every waking minute hurt. There was a heaviness in the center of my chest that felt like a 50lb lead weight; all the time.

  
I was ready, for some relief, i was ready to end it all...

the reason why I want to decide my death is because of mortality of human. I don't want to be old and want to kill myself at like I am 30-40 years old. I am afraid of dying before that age from other reasons.

I wish I couldn't die even from killing myself. I want my power to force me living. I might just want to suffer from pain that would kill me without dying.

"Today has been the hardest day so far... I'm going to be transparent here and tell you that I've suffered so deeply with severe depression in the last few months.. my entire life really if I'm being completely honest with myself. I felt like a lot of pillars that were supporting my life just crumbled away from me out of my control and all I could do was just sit and watch it happen absolutely grief-stricken.   
I feel stuck and trapped. Drained of any drive, any finances, any real idea of what the future is going to look like. I unfortunately spend a lot of time alone and in my own head, as grim as it is to admit, fantasising about dying. What ways I could do it, what would be the least painful and quickest method. I hate thinking like this. I try to separate myself from the thoughts ""I notice that I am having thoughts that are suicidal."" But days like today I just imagine standing on top of the bridge and swan diving off it backwards so I can look at the sky while I plummet to my death.   
I've lived a good life, I've travelled, I fell in love, I pursed whatever dreams I used to have. But I don't feel any of those things anymore, I feel numb, everything feels bleak. I don't see the point of getting out of bed most days, other than the crushing pressure of needing an income, to support a life I honestly don't even know that I want anymore. I've spent hours crying today because I don't know what to do, who to talk to, where to go, how to fix anything. Depression makes you feel like a massive toxic shit stain on peoples lives that just drains and drains, which adds to the spiral.   
I know I'm not alone in thinking like this. One of the hardest things I've had to do is ADMIT that I am depressed and ADMIT that I need help, to go to the GP and get the anti-depressants. But it's also insanely difficult to open up to your loved ones and be completely truthful about how dark your thoughts have gotten. Cos there's also not really an answer, a right thing to say or to do, nothing that grants any kind of instant alleviation, and I hate the pressure I put on people when I do tell them.... its like you've mentally burdened them.  
I adore the few people that I do have in my life so much that I can't bare the thought of them having to deal with my death and my funeral. So I know I'll most likely always be too much of a coward to actually do anything.  
But right now, I'm lost, I feel like nothing, I feel like I have nothing worthwhile to give anymore. Some days the small interactions and moments get to me and I see those little glimmers and blissful moments that life can sometimes reveal to you. But small moments are only small moments.

I train with one of them every day for almost 8 hours. They also have worked together for years and have already formed bonds, so I def feel left out (which is fine, but awkward).

"How do you deal with depressive episodes when you have nobody in life to be there for you and speak to? I've been having constant depressive episodes lately. I’m only in high school. I can’t get therapy, medicine, or any diagnosis at all since I don’t want to worry my parents, and it’s expensive. There’s also the stigma in my country’s culture (the Philippines), unfortunately, that having mental health issues is being “crazy“— and stuff like therapy. That’s just a privilege for the rich. I know I’m not diagnosed yet, so I can’t say for sure, but at this point, when I’ve tried to take my own life a few times already, I guess I don’t know anymore.   


The worst part is I’m alone. Some friends have left me, and my only buddy that made me want to keep on living and also gave me support during school is now in a different section because I couldn’t transfer to his section since the principal said I was just self-diagnosing myself and never had any proof of my own mental problems. Ever since then, I’ve been suffering, constantly alone in school. I was already suffering, but now everything’s just gone worse. I deal with 11 hours of school and hours of excruciating loneliness and constant overthinking while having thoughts on how tired I am of living on a constant basis every day. After all this, I’ll go home, immediately falling asleep and then studying again to sleep at 2 AM while my household has constant arguments happening over and over again. How cruel is life really going to be for me? I’ve been having more moments where I just randomly break down crying, and it’s happened a few times in school.   


Everything feels so excruciatingly difficult to handle anymore, and giving up just sounds so nice, but I’m scared of hurting myself, and there’s nobody to ever be there for me. I’ve always dealt with my problems alone; I’m used to it, but after having friends last year to be there for me, now some of them cut me off because of some unresolved arguments, and my best buddy rarely puts in as much of the effort to hang out and being there for me anymore lately. I know everyone has their own lives, and I wish to respect that. So I guess I’ll just have to deal with it all alone, even if it’s difficult. Even if I’m being pushed to the brink of just entirely giving up.   


But man, it really is difficult having nobody to be there for you, nobody to listen out to your struggles. Sometimes some people are there, but then I’ll have this feeling of guilt that I don’t want to trouble them with the depth of my own problems. I just wish that someone really truly cared for me; they don’t always have to be there, but just being there for me is enough because dealing with this all by myself is really pushing me to the edge. And sometimes, I just really don’t know anymore how much I’ll have left when I gain the courage to just end it all.",depression
"BPD Hi I’m a 23 y/o female diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and major depressive disorder and I’ve been dealing with depression since I was in 7th grade.

"I’m struggling with my partner’s severe depression and recent trauma. My partner is currently in an intense residency program, working 12-hour shifts four days a week, plus a seven-hour class on her other workday. Recently, her schedule increased to 12-hour shifts five days a week, including Saturdays and holidays, with class still on Thursdays. About six months ago, she uncovered a previously suppressed memory of childhood sexual abuse involving someone close to her, which has deeply affected her mental health. Over these six months, we’ve only seen each other twice. Both times she stayed overnight, and though we spent time talking and watching movies, there was no physical closeness. She has developed an aversion to touch, and when she left, we only shared a brief, timid hug.

At first, we still talked daily and did activities together online to stay close despite the challenges. She expressed wanting to get better and seemed motivated to work on her mental health. The only “good day” she’s had in all this time was after a spa day I gifted her. That day, we exchanged dinners, had a video call, I sent her flowers and a card, and we watched some YouTube videos together before bed. But a few days later, her abuser (who no longer abuses her but did so for about two years in her childhood) walked into her room while she was changing, which seemed to push her back to square one.

Shortly after, she blocked me on Instagram, which I suspect was after seeing one of my posts during a brief no-contact period when I thought we had broken up. She reached out a week later, and we had a nice conversation where I discovered that we actually hadn’t broken up yet, and she told me she had started using cannabis (something she had been strongly against) and had quit therapy, feeling it was ineffective.

Now, she says she wants to end the relationship because she feels unable to be close to me physically or emotionally. She tells me I’m “the love she never thought she’d find” but feels that someone like me deserves more than what she can give in her current state. Despite her feelings, she continues with her challenging job, which only seems to worsen her condition. Her situation is compounded by her parents’ recent separation and the fact that she still lives with her abusive family member. She often ignores my messages, and we rarely do anything together now.

After the no-contact period, we had an open conversation where I gently suggested she might have depression. She thanked me for bringing it up and said she’d look into it, but also shared that she no longer feels any hope for herself or her future. She has even expressed suicidal thoughts but says she “unfortunately” doesn’t have the courage to go through with it. She’s reluctant to try psychiatric medications (as a nurse, she has access to many and fears she might abuse them after past experiences where she nearly damaged her stomach). She’s even mentioned being open to harder drugs if cannabis stops working, which deeply worries me given her family history of addiction.

She’s always been “the child who didn’t cause problems” and feels neglected, without any real support system. She’s trying to push me away to “protect” me, saying that I don’t deserve someone like her who “can’t even provide the basics.” She frequently apologizes for how things are, including when she admitted to using cannabis—she said she was sorry for “self-destructing and disappointing” me.

I’m struggling to separate her from her illness and unsure what’s depression-driven and what’s not. I'm the only person who knows what she’s going through, yet I’m the one person she is pushing away. She says she’s isolated from friends, but every now and then I come across social media posts of her smiling and touching her friends, which is difficult to process. I understand that depression isn’t always about being in bed all day, but it’s confusing.

I’m deeply worried about her safety, but I feel helpless as she won’t let me in. Should I just accept the breakup and let her know I’ll always be here if she wants help? Should I give her space and check in from time to time? I’m at a complete loss and could really use advice.",depression

But, when I got here, my roommate helped introduce me to some of his friends, and from there I thought I was truly branching out and meeting lots of people who cared about me.  I never really had any true friends in high school so this feeling allowed me to see past my own insecurities for a while.  But now, a couple months in, I noticed very quickly that not a single person who I thought I was ""friends"" with cares about me.  They pretended to care when I would get blackout drunk to cope with my own mental health issues, but then as soon as I showed signs of progress, they would leave me in the dust, going out every weekend without me, even going as far as making plans with the specific goal of leaving me somewhere so that I wouldn't be around for the remainder of the night.  These past few weeks, I haven't been able to eat or sleep properly, study productively, or go through a day without spiraling out in a manic state of crying and self hatred.  I don't want to kill myself, but I also don't know how to keep living if my social circumstances are impacting every facet of my life.  My parents told me that the best way to get through this would be to try meeting new people, but that was my intention in leaving home and coming to the school i'm at now, and its resulted in me now wishing that I didn't exist, because at least then I wouldn't have to worry about how my inner thoughts of loneliness are consuming everything I set out to accomplish in life.",depression
"My painful existence  This is my first and probably only post I’ll ever make and it’ll probably never be seen but if someone dies see it thank you for your time. 

My father was never in my life. He chose not to be there and then spent 15 years of my life in prison. I never cared too much for him which sounds bad but ig he was never really my father so how could I. My mother raised me for 9 years in what I can only describe as hell. She was on drugs most of the time with a boyfriend who beat on her pretty regularly. Sometimes I saw it but most of it is locked away in my head somewhere. I don’t remember a lot about that point in my life but I know it was hell. More often than nought I took care of myself and cleaned everything. I never really hated my mom until i went to go live with my grandparents and she abandoned me. I always thought I wasn’t good enough for her because why would she chose the drugs over her only son at the time. Why couldn’t she clean up for me and why did I have to go live with my grandparents who Al thought tried there best couldn’t help but see my mom every time they laid eyes on me. Anyways that didn’t last long and by the time I was 14 I was living with my great grandmother. Things were so good with her. She was the mom I needed in my life and the only person that I feel truly loved me. She was my Angel and I miss her so much. February of last year she sadly passed away from breast cancer that spread to her other bodily organs. I hate myself everyday for not enjoying the last years I had left with her and for not being who she needed me to be. See she was diagnosed my junior year of highschool which is right when I started smoking weed and getting into drugs heavy. It got so bad that one night she needed me to take her to the hospital but I was so high I nodded off in my bed and she had to walk to the neighbors and get them to take her. That’s one of the things I regret the most about what I did to her. The woman who saved me and gave me the world I let down. Everyday I think about how she didn’t get to see me get clean. She would be so proud because she believed in me when no one else did. She was my lifeline and I was her failure. Seems like I’m most peoples failure. While she had cancer I ended up getting a girl pregnant and not being able to support them at all. That’s my other biggest regret. She went through her pregnancy alone and probably the first year of our sons life financially alone. And just when we had our shit together and we’re finally living together and I was doing everything right I ruined it all. Now I’m stuck in a custody battle and have to prove I’m fit to be a father even though I don’t even believe I am. I hate myself for how I’ve let my life turn out, who I’ve hurt, and pushing the few things I cared about away from me. I don’t know why I do the things I do and I don’t know if I’ll ever know. A lot of the time I just want it all to be over. I don’t wanna hurt anymore, I don’t wanna let people down, and I don’t want to keep doing this. It feels like I’m trapped in my own living hell and that no matter what I do I can’t escape. I’m drowning. I have no mouth and I must scream. 


Sorry. I know that probably wasn’t put together well and sounds like gibberish but I don’t have the energy to go into more details or make it look cute or coherent. I just needed to vent.",depression
"Contemplating suicide again I don't know what to do anymore. I've lost my family and my friends and I've never felt this alone in my life. 

It feels like I have nothing left to live for and no one to turn to. My depression has been getting worse with the past few months and I've had a suicide attempt last month that failed and I'm wondering of trying again at the end of this month. Therapy hasn't helped me. I feel like every day is a blur and I'm barely eating and taking care of myself. Death would be much easier than this and at least if dead I don't have to worry.

"School problem Hello everyone, i apologize for any errors but this is not my first language.
I’ve been diagnosed with anxious depression in September (but I’ve been dealing with it for years before this).
It’s been really hard for me to go to school recently, and my mother doesn’t help.
My therapist even told her that I’m in therapy to get past this problem and to not make it worse for me but she just doesn’t care and yells at me everytime I stay home.
I missed 13 days and I’m contemplating if going today, because I just feel so bad.
My mother just tells me I’m lazy and that I’m shielding myself with my diagnosis because “you’re taking advantage of it to be lazy and not go to school”when most days I struggle even with getting out of bed.
And it’s not like I hate going to school or anything because I really like it and I get good grades.
What should I do? Any advice is appreciated.",depression
"it feels like depression has been there all my life what the title says. its like as soon as i gained consciousness, everything was a little strange, but i just didnt realize it at the time. after thinking about it, i realized my name did not feel right, like it was a foreign concept. any online alias i chose felt better. im not sure iff this is because of depression or some other things but because of this, ive always had a doubt within me that im sort of not a real person. i know i am, but sometimes it just feels like im some lifeless clone or a vessel of some sort for someone to control",depression
"I don't know what to do Hi, I just joined this subreddit after reading posts from here from a long time ago. I have a lot of issues that may have been a product of my childhood life and how I was raised. 

My parents provide the necessity for me, yet they never try to be emotionally available for me. I have to learn how to become compassionate through movies, book and anime since I tried to be available for my sisters whenever they need comforting or raising. I have been their ""parents"" emotionally since around 8 years old and since then have forgot to take account of my own feelings and well-being. Eventually, I have lost all sense of self-love and care for myself. I have also learn to put on a mask throughout the years, which ends up make me forgot about my real personalities and desires.

Eventually it all bottled up during my pre-teen and teen age when I eventually tried my first suicide attempt at 18 years old, which failed because 8-ish people held me back physically trying not to let me jump. Since then I tried my best to act the best I could be, but sometimes at some random times the thought of ""I'm tired"" popped up and before I knew it I always tried to off myself again, which always stopped by fear of afterlife.

Lately it has been worse since I never got any treatment/professional help and my parents are no longer providing the necessities for me and my sisters and just provide for themselves. I am currently also working on my bachelor degree, including providing for my sisters (and sometimes house necessities like electric and water, but the rent is still handled by my parents) while being their parents also in times they need advice or someone to cry to. In the past 2 weeks, I have attempted at least 10 suicide being the last one makes me unable to walk for a few days.

At first I have given up completely and have cut all contact with my friends, because I no longer want them to see my miserable state and don't want them to be stressed because of my countless attempt. But my crush, the last person to ever really cared for me, reached out to me despite I pushed her aways and tell me not to do that  and that I should try to fight it. 

After thinking for a whole night and morning, I'm a bit skeptical to follow her request but I'd like to give it one last try with all the help I can get. But should I be really try to ""fix"" myself now despite my environment may makes me unable to progress at all or should I just suck it up and hope for the best and not suddenly die in the process? Because tbh, I am tired and really tired of everything in this house but I can't get out since I don't have somewhere to go and never saved up any money.",depression
"I feel so empty  I don’t even know where to begin. For as long as I can remember, it’s been ups and downs, like this endless cycle of highs and lows that never really ends. I’m 17, about to turn 18, and right now, I feel completely empty inside. It’s like everything that used to matter, everything I used to care about, has just… faded. And I’m left here, in this hollow space, not knowing where to go or what to do.

Every day feels like a battle with myself. I take antidepressants, hoping they’ll somehow help me feel better, or at least keep me from sinking lower. But it’s getting harder and harder. Simple things, like getting up to shower or opening a book to study, feel almost impossible. I know they should matter, and I keep telling myself to just push through, but it’s like nothing has any meaning anymore.

I don’t know if anyone else has felt like this—so empty that even basic things lose their purpose. I’m reaching out because I just don’t know how to face it. Have any of you gone through something like this? How do you deal with it? How do you keep going when it feels like nothing is worth the effort?

If you’ve found a way through, I’d love to hear it. Maybe just knowing someone out there understands could make things feel a little less heavy.",depression

"I'm tired boss I'm just kinda over having intrusive thoughts about ending myself every day. I'm tired of wanting to get back into heroin because if it doesn't just make me feel better it will kill me. I'm tired of waking up every day wishing I didn't. I'm tired of not being interested in the things I like. I'm tired of not having an appetite until it hurts. I'm tired of therapists that are happy just asking how I'm doing that day without looking any deeper.

I'm just so tired of continuing. I'm sure I sound like an angsty teen even though I'm getting close to 20 years of this. I'd just like to not be guilt tripped into continuing. I don't expect any response to this. I'm sure so many people before me have said the same thing

I'm not exactly good with words. I can't express how I'm feeling past I'm angry for no reason or to the point of crying without pause for seemingly no reason. I'm just over waking up on this side of the grass. I've no ambition to do better. I just want to give up but I'm torn because it would hurt other people.

I've only got two people who even talk to me at this point. One being my brother and the other his friend that I just think pities me.

I guess I'm just hoping I can find a way to feel better. But I'm an older dude who feels isolated. But I should be hella privileged except I've never gotten ahead because when I start to get to a good point I go back to heroin hoping that it'll just barely kill me so people just think I'm a scumbag who overdosed.

"I don't even want to make it thru life Edit: Long rant

I want to be a commercial pilot but the more I look into what I need to do and the money and time I don't have it just seems impossible. I'm just going to be stuck at McDonalds for the rest of my freaking life. I have to get a stupid bachelor's degree because you need that to fly an airliner for some stupid reason. How about just knowing how to fly a plane and not crash it?

I can't even afford to find medication that works for my anxiety and depression because I can't afford health insurance and I have to just try each of them until I find one that works I guess and I don't have the money to do that and who knows if any of them even work or how many I'll have to try and see if they work. And my mood is all over the place so how will I even know if it is working? I'm so sick of working on farms and at grocery stores and fast food places. I can't see a way to get out of this and get to something better. I have autism, anxiety, depression, and no money or time to do anything else except work, eat and sleep.

"Either tears or apathy. No in between. A year ago, my grandmother died unexpectedly. About a month later, my dog of nearly 18 years was put to sleep.

I thought I couldn’t be more down on life. Then I met a girl and she brought me back out of the pit. I truly fell for her and saw my future with her

The love of my life, almost a year under our belt, gone in a single day. My rock, my anchor. Gone because of a stupid single argument that meant nothing.

A week and a half later, I lose my comfortable job of 3 years because I was so depressed and losing it that I ended up doing something stupid and getting let go. 

A few days after that, I learn I have $4k in surprise student loans that I had no idea about.

I’m 24, I live with my parents still, haven’t graduated college yet. $60 to my name because I keep spending my money on quick dopamine fixes like anime statues, skins in video games or weed. Now here I am. Cutting cheese at a grocery store for work, barely going to the gym anymore, getting high every night just so I can fall asleep, barely speaking to anyone, even the 2 friends I still manage to have after all these years. I have goals but no motivation to act on them anymore. I have ambition, but no more drive. I’m empty. I’m gone, yet still here.

My mind keeps going to her. To the good times of yesteryear. Back when I was happy. Back to our first kiss. Back to when I was a happy kid in elementary school. Back when I was playing around with my dog. Back when I wasn’t such a fuck up.

Back when I didn’t have an ideal spot to end my life at. 

I just walk around now, a husk of a person. Either that or I’m on the brink of another tear filled break down. I never used to break down. In the last 3 months, I’ve broken down 4 times. I look in the mirror and see no life in my eyes anymore. I actually have bags under them now. Didn’t use to have any a year or so ago. I find myself crying to sleep more times than not now. I find no joy in anything anymore. Writing. Cooking. Gaming. Nothing. I started therapy. It isn’t helping much and it’s getting quite expensive. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. Everywhere I go, I see her face and the moments we shared. Every time I look down at the ground, I see a quick flash of my dog standing beside my legs. Every time I open my phone, there seems to be a notification about memories with my grandma on Facebook.

I don't have goals or ambitions. I don't have a dream job or anything. I'm not particularly good at anything, im just average. I don't excel at anything and I don't have the energy to care anymore.

I have no desire to have kids. all of the things that people say make life worth living simply don't appeal to me. I have almost no friends and I'm frequently outcasted.

"Lifetime depression  I’ve been depressed since I can remember. I remember being 5/6 and saying out loud that I want to die. Some times are better than others but it’s always looming over. My husband has recently become paralyzed because of his own drunken actions so now I’m his caregiver, and that’s already hard enough, but now he just takes his pain and frustration out on me. I don’t  even want to be around him anymore. I don’t even want to wake up anymore. 

At this point the only thing keeping me here is my cat. We have other animals, but she is my baby and is very shy around strangers, kids, and other animals. The other animals could be adopted out or given to animals and thrive, but she wouldn’t. And of course he hates her. Doesn’t hurt her or anything just talks about how much he hates her. 

My house is a mess and I know when other people come over they judge me but I don’t care. I don’t care about just about anything anymore. The only thing I’ve ever wanted was to be a mom, but I’ve had 5 miscarriages, so I don’t see that panning out. Maybe for good reason. I don’t know.

"Yeah, I don't really know anymore I just had a 'breakdown' a few hours ago. I am a highschool senior and I just had a breakdown at school because I was being unreasonable.

For context, I had a speaking project due today and I had been avoiding it ever since. The project required us to submit a recording trying to sell the product to our teacher. However, I just can't do it. I can't communicate well with people nor am I comfortable talking with anyone but my few close friends. I am more than shy but not enough to be diagnosed with social anxiety, but I do panic regularly with people interaction, presentations or speaking in general for a long time now. It is not like I just don't want to do the project, I do want to but I really just want to slit my throat in half thinking about the speaking part. No one knows about my so-called condition and they are not going to. Anyway, I was feeling worried all day cause I know I'll pay for my actions, but it soon makes me feel ill. Around the time before the lesson started, I tried to go down to the medical clinic for a check up and hopefully it was 'my way out'. Unfortunately, the nurse said they won't accept my reason for feeling ill so I have to stay for class. My emotion kinda started to build up, cause the truth was truly not valid, I went to the class with a 'breakdown'. I don't know anymore, maybe it made up, feeling so wrong calling it a breakdown. Eventually, I called my mom and got sent home after meeting with my homeroom teacher. I keep on crying on my way home.

I don’t know where to post this and I'm sorry if my writing was messy, I don't really know how to put this into words. Also, to try to make things clear:

\- I grew up in a standard Asian family.

\- I had struggled with depression for a couple of years, only I knew about this, I had tried to reduce it and it was looking good for a year until I returned to school this year.

\- I only struggle with speaking project, which always required a recording or presentation, and there is one speaking project every two weeks. For all the past projects, I had only submitted one after having a few breakdowns (this one is legit).

\- I do acknowledge that I am wrong for not submitting the project, trying to go home in order to avoid confrontation and I am responsible for my own 'breakdown'.

Man, as I'm writing this, I think I'm just upset, but at the same time I know the fact that as soon as I come back to the project, I might not be able to change much. I mean I'm already feeling distressed, I should be able to do it now I guess.

"Wasted the last 7 years of my life accomplishing nothing. Ever since I was little, I was the no-thinking ADHD type, never really thought ahead of time more than maybe a minute or two. I had already been diagnosed with ADHD and mild Aspergers. I never took my diagnosis seriously, opting to believe I wasn't any different (which is mostly true for neurodivergent people, but there' a reason you get the diagnosis in the first place.) Always been an extrovert (with an ironic impulsiveness to say stupid sh\*t, getting people to dislike me) and eventually I started shutting myself off from other people. Used to talk to my friends every day, seeing if I could come over and such. In my late teens, I gradually started to struggle even contacting people over Discord just to play, opting to just passively wait to see if someone enters a channel.

I spent the entirety of my youth just having meaningless fun, doing the bare minimum (sometimes not even that) so that I could go back to playing videogames or play outside. I never cared about my future and at most, I just wanted a basic job so I could live and get a more powerful gaming rig. 

  
I had that attitude for years up until my 20's, where my life completely collapsed. I stopped going to work eventually, opting to just play games and then I let my apartment go to absolute sh\*t, getting me kicked out. Lost my job and have been living on welfare since. Not a day has passed since where I haven't thought about killing myself.

I've managed to snag a job here and there but I keep doing the same thing, being absent once or twice, gradually shifting to completely absent for weeks on end. I struggle doing even the most basic things like cleaning, laundry and eating regularly. I barely hang out with friends anymore since I can't afford even basic stuff like going to a bar and such, unless someone else pays for me. 

  
I'm 25 years old now, and i live in a group-home and all my neighbors are evidently in need of that help, but I feel out of place. I feel like I'm getting so much help to the point where I don't have to life my life anymore. I genuinely feel like I have no reason to move forward anymore. 

If I were to even begin fixing my life, I just get exhausted thinking about it. Family doesn't want to deal with me outside of maybe eating together every now and then. I am just a resource-drain for everyone around me and no matter how much help I get, I just can't make it work.

Just recently requested a proper psychiatrist, who may also re-evaluate my diagnosis, but it might be years away from now.

"Having a really rough time  Yesterday Was planning on killing myself and was too scared of the balcony. I haven’t felt happy in a really long time. I ended my relationship 4 months ago because I didn’t feel happy and then I just felt even worse after it ended. Today I just learned that she moved on with some guy that she was friends with while we were together. Even outside of that I’m not excited by graduating, potentially starting a new job, or anything. I just want to feel happy but all I feel is numb. I don’t think I’ve felt happy in a long time and I’m just looking for some sort of validation. I don’t even know what the root of my problem is, maybe I just hate myself and everything about me. Either way I really want to go ahead and do it but I just can’t find the courage. ",depression
"In 5 years I’m a 29 year old female and it feels like I’ve been living on auto pilot for a majority of my life. I stopped hoping for the future long ago and I don’t know what to do next. 

A part of me hopes that everything will be okay and that if I  just have a little more faith this next chapter will be better. 

But deep down I’ve made a pact with myself that in a max of 5 years if I feel like life hasn’t improved I’m going to commit.  

I say 5 because for the first 29 years it feels like I’ve been holding on for other people. I stopped believing in life around middle school. 

People will mourn, I know the pain gets passed onto someone else but I don’t care. 
I tried to commit back in middle school and since then it feels like life has been passing me by. 

Im going to give it a fair shot but honestly im not sure how much of a fight I have left. Even 5 years feels like a chore. ",depression

I feel like every time I try and think things are finally getting better everything falls apart worse than the last time. At this point I feel like I'm missing out on so much of life that others around me are experiencing and I'll never get to. I feel so lonely, I have been trying to reach out to people and do fun things and it's great for a little bit, but then it feels like everyone kinda moves on. It's not their fault at all, but I just wish I could have someone who'd stick around. I've been trying really hard to put myself out there, but I'm stuck in this infinite loop and no matter how hard I try it feels like I can never truley succeed at anything.

"Starting again  Not sure if it’s seasonal or situational. I hate that I can’t control my mind or emotions. All I want to do is isolate and ignore everyone. It all becomes too much. Life isn’t going like I’d hope, but when I’m in this mindset everything just hits harder and I can’t cope. No matter how hard I try to force myself to think positive I just can’t anymore. Like darkness I can’t escape. I pray for relief, it helps for a little while until I start thinking about things again. I feel like a horrible mom and person in general.

"Consumed by Hatred I’m sorry. I don’t know where else to go. So many awful things happened to me in the past several years that I won’t go into but the trauma of it all eats me alive. It has turned everyone against me and the 2 friends that I talk to just tell me to let it go. They’re sick and tired of me venting all the damn time and I don’t have anyone else anymore. I know someone as full of hatred as I am should just fuck off and go away and not waste anyone else’s time with my negativity. Even now I hate myself for wanting to form a close bond with someone else but it seems I can’t even have that because all my friends either left or the 2 that I thought I still had are clearly tired of my shit and don’t wanna hear anything I have to say anymore. I wish I would drop dead but I don’t even have the courage to kill myself. The truth is I’m such a negative person and I hate humans. Maybe that’s why my only 2 friends are so sick of my shit, because I never stop hating everyone else. Maybe the saddest part is how I don’t want to change because I need this renewed hatred in order to survive everyone else’s stupid games and two-facedness. It all just sucks and I feel like a fool for even thinking I could confide in anybody. ",depression
"It's not the end of the world, but I wish it was Then it wouldn't be my fault if I just quit. I wouldn't need to worry about abandoning anybody or upsetting anyone. Or for being a failure who can't do anything right or succeed. 

I've been telling myself repeatedly that my failure isn't the end of the world, that even if things don't go my way I can find another path and that it's okay if I'm a little behind and unsure what to do; ya know, positivity stuff.

But I still feel like shit. It's so hard to not give up when for most of your life you can't even see your ownself in your own future. I don't know why I am here or why I exist. I just want to drop off the face of the planet but I'm stupid and I kept trying and trying and trying to get better and in return now I have to worry about hurting the people I love if I do leave.

"I (M19) can’t feel anything positive For context, I’ve always been told I’m gifted and usually ace classes, I’m good at sports and pretty anything I try. But I can’t help but always feel inadequate. It may sound weird but I see everyone my age drinking, smoking, having fun and getting intimate with their girlfriends and I feel so dissociated. It’s like I don’t belong in that world. I rarely go out, have only 3 friends but I feel like an alien, like I’m faraway from everyone and everything. With the people close to me, there will be times where I’ll feel like I love them but soon after, it fades away. Like I don’t care about anyone or anything. I don’t feel joy, love, sadness or even anger. I’m just hollow. I know it sounds edgy but it’s been like that since I’ve been 13 and only got worse. If I could I’d end it all…I live because I want to see how far I can take my potential.

"I'm a (25) female. Suffering from depression.  I got diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder last year. Just little background and why I have it, I was bullied a lot even though I was homeschooled. My parents neglected me in a lot of ways. I also was sexual abused as a kid. I grew with no friends for the majority of my childhood. Spent most of my days setting in a closet ruminating. I feel like this past 5 years when I've tried to make friends there always some undercurrent of dislike they have towards me. For example, I used to be a psych major and this girl tried to be friends with told me she thought all of psych was crap which I can understand where she was coming from but she didn't seem to like that about me. One girl acted like she wanted to be my friend flaked on me and I ended up having a panic attack. I made a guy friend to and he just seemed annoyed with me for being shy like I said hi in a quieter tone one time and he rolled his eyes at me. My siblings don't like me they criticize my every move. I had a crush on this one guy and he basically was hot and cold with me and it broke my heart because I had feelings for him. I don't have a college degree, I love anything related to art, I do have several artistic hobbies but I feel like no one will like me because I don't have a degree and I'm cleaner and I feel too many people look down at cleaners. I've grown all lot as I've gotten older, I dress well, I'm clean, I'm kind, I have better social skills, I'm not ugly but I'm not like a model or anything but I'm still insecure and I feel no one will like me. I often feel like I shouldn't be around people because I still have that somewhat insecure vibe to me no matter how valuable I try to be and there is always that depressive paranoia that people will judge me for my life choices but I'm 25 and I've basically given up trying to talk to anyone this past year and half and the clock is ticking (Please be constructive and please don't be rude) Thanks.

"It has robbed me of the simplest joys of life. Now I'm just waiting for the end There was a time when I could still fall back to things that brought me some form of joy. Now, even those things don't do much for me anymore. This depression has progressively gotten worse and robbed me of even the simplest joys of life. Music is still my saviour, but there's not much else that can save me anymore.

I'm just waiting for the end, trucking along in an empty vessel that I feel like a mere passenger in. I don't feel in control of my body anymore, nor do I want to navigate this life anymore. My consciousness feels alien to my body. I tried so hard to be somebody, and now I wish to be nobody.

What do i do Throughout my school life I didnt try in school and ended up failing a year for not going for a semester. My aunt asked me to move in with them to finish my junior and senior year. But my problem is that im broke with no transportation and outside of school stuck inside this house. This neighborhood is miles out from stores and this city has nothing. I hate myself so much and can't do anything outside of school and cant get a job or ride except a few times a month to my friends from another city. I have 7 or so months of school left till i can move back with my mom and start working and i am absolutely miserable and think it may lead to me losing my girlfriend which i would never want. I have no troubles here i just hate myself and am lonely as can be. I cant pick up any hobbies because im broke and gaming and tv isnt enough to distract me anymore. Im running out of distractions from myself and want to die tho as far as i know i wouldn't kill myself. I have problems feeling like im not enough or worse than earlier bfs to my semi popular gf who plays sports and has a great outside life. She tells me everything i need to hear but my brain tells me shes only telling me this because shes with me now. Pls give advice and maybe a certain outlook that could help me. ,depression

"I keep forgetting that I'm not a person. Of course, there are moments when I can genuinely feel happy, maybe even hopeful. I want to keep going, at least out of spite. I fool myself, letting myself think that there can be a way out of this, but then it engulfs me whole, reminding me how pathetic that really is. 

""Haha. How could someone like you wish for anything other than death? Isn't that what you really want, anyway? To give up?"" - coming from within.

Often, it's really just that - fleeting moments of ""joy"", and I get greedy, even if they're caused by something unhealthy or dangerous, because I'm grasping at straws. That's all I know.

It's hard to remember the last time I could properly focus. Almost like brain fog, but rather complete darkness, with barely a silhouette of a concise thought appearing once in a while, quick to fade. My memory is non-existent, even if I try to train it. I can't make decisions on my own, because I have zero self-esteem and don't care about anything, I don't have any goals, skills, achievements, self-esteem or dreams. Not sure if I even have feelings. 
And yet, sometimes I feel like I'm a person. Like I could function as well as any relatively ""sane"" human being. Like if I just tried harder, I could become someone. Then I realise it's ridiculous, then I feel like I could actually end it, instead of putting it off for ""some day"", but something always gets in the way, I distract myself, pretend like I'm not constantly having a mental breakdown in the back of my mind, and repeat that over and over and over again, for years, because I'm that much of a worthless, stubborn, and foolish coward.",depression

I have no relationship, in fact I was with someone for 7yrs who left me to married someone else behind my back... took my youth. Threw me away fast forward now I'm 29 no kids , no marriage. I can not feel love for anyone or anything anymore. Like I mean it.  I work at target overnight stock 16$ while everyone around me is 19-25 years old. I sleep all day and everyone sees me as lazy. In fact ppl .. especially my aunt Tells me not to tell ppl I work target or whatever job I have bc they think it's embarrassing. They keep saying why u can't just go school get better life bc it's better than saying u work xx. I am an introvert, I have social anxiety.. grown and the anxiety is so crippling .

I don’t know why I feel so depressed all of a sudden but I’ve had these problems since I was 13 or 14, early on I’d decided I wanted to kill myself and that thought always made me sad but not anymore, whenever I’m feeling happy I switch up real fast and think of suicide, I don’t purposefully think about it but once it’s in my mind it won’t leave for a while.

"why do i always get bullied Everyday when I go to school Im always made fun of and my feelings arent taken seriously. People always make a joke of me like im not a real person. Ive never said anything except the usual retalliation like shutup or I try to think of something I can make fun of them with but they seem unphased and just say something like nice one mate or just laugh. I cant go one day with being reminded of my past mistakes or my facial features. These people I once called my friends would mock me on my ""yellow teeth"" or my ""big nose"" and sometimes petty things like why do your eyebrows look waxed. I simply pluck the hairs on my unibrow because I take care of myself. It feels like every detail about me has to be pointed out. I hate it and its constantly happening everyday and never changes. People say things to me about my hair saying how it looks boxy or like im trying to get fluffy hair. I just have brown short hair with a fringe. Ive never said anything bad or done anything bad to these people. Ive never mocked anyone or been rude. But simply im always the target for jokes and mean words.Somebody once said to me I have no subtle features and that all my facial features stand out. Due to it being winter my lips always get cracked from the cold weather and ofcourse I put vaseline. And ofcourse a couple people have to point out that it looks like I got punched or somebody slit my lip in half and that ""You need vaseline bro"". And always people bring up things like ""atleast I didnt get beat up by a ginger"".Im so ashamed of myself for being peer pressured into a fight. I had never fought before or had combat training. I swung a punch and he ducks and punches me in the face. I take a step back and swing again but im stopped by a teacher. Maybe about 100-200 students were watching me get hugged by the teacher and the other person staring me down. I feel like im always the centre for hate. Im made fun of repeatedly for being rejected by girls and failed relationships. I was being laughed at today because when I sat down in class my trousers were pulled up just enough to see my ankles. I shower everyday but apparently they just look funny or something. I was wearing ankle socks and standard kickers yet I heard someone say ""look at his shoes"". Honestly, Ive never ever told anyone about my problems and I always bottle them up. Ive never lashed out or cried or any of the sort. Recently, this girl I know but have never spoken to didnt invite me to her birthday. This might seem petty but it really hit me how all of my ""friends"" were invited and I wasnt. I was sat a home all alone with nobody to talk to watching them have so much fun on their instagram stories. A while back I asked my teacher if I could sit next to one of my friends I respected. She let me sit there aslong as we behaved and we did. But recently he asked to move to sit next to someone else. I soon realised how I was nobodys 1st option and not even their 2nd or 3rd. I felt like I had no friends in the world. I sit alone in that class now and In the mornings during form I also sit alone. That friend who moved away even said to me he asked to move and that ""your gonna be alone now"". My ""friends"" almost never respond to my text messages and if they do it's late. Im literally depressed yet noone seems to care enough to notice. Around 2 years back I started training in the gym and I have been keeping at it quite inconsitently. A couple months on a couple off. I still havent seen any progress. The most progress I have seen was when i was eating good and went around 5 times a week for 6-7 weeks. My biceps and chest were growing slightly. I even started fapping less and playing videogames less. I spent more time with family and even went out with a girl for the first time. We went to the park and cuddled on the bench watching the ducks on the lake. But then, I went on holiday and this girl stopped talking to me as much. We eventually fully stopped communicating after 3 weeks and I wasnt sure why. Later on when I get back I message her. Apparently she has a boyfriend. I tell one of my ""friends"" and I deeply regret this as im always made fun of now for being ""cheated"" on even though we was never dating. While I was on holiday some of my gains were still there and my strength but I started fapping again and I wasnt training. This 5 week long holiday I was just playing videogames and not even having fun. It was a new low and when I got back I tried going to the gym and getting into the rhythm again but I couldnt. So I just started playing games all day and fapping not even brushing my teeth every night. I would stay up all night and sleep all day. Eat junk food and become lazy. By this point I had lost all my gains and strength and anything good about me. It could be a new low. When I was younger I achieved consistently high grades and was praised for being smart. But now Im always late to school missing around 2 hours im the morning and my grades are getting much worse.

Ill continue this if it gets attention and anybody if actually reads this.But right now its getting late and my fingers are tired from typing. If you have read this far THANK YOU it means so much that you are a considerate and thoughtful human being.

Good bad perfect... I can't.     I'm lost and lowkey don't want to be found. Anyone felt similar.

I know ppl mean well when they are like think positive, appreciate life ... this I swear I try to everyday and genuinely try but it's something u can't force bc even in ur self conscious can't fake until u make bc the little voice behind the other little voice won't let me .      It's life I guess. My life :(.      I want to hear what GENUINELY helped u get out a depression that's not the typical cliché stuff, if possible.   Or let me know I'm not atleast .

"My brain translates any feeling to “I want to die” Any emotion is converted to the thought of wanting to die, even if I don’t really mean it. Feeling tired? I want to die. Feeling happy?

I go to school everyday and laugh with friends all the time. Yet, when I go home it feel like this feeling that makes everything so faux. So artificial it feels as if my life was a plastic box and I was stuck inside. 

What’s worse is when people will invalidate my feelings when i’m expressing myself.

"Is it possible to heal from so much pain? Hi everyone,

I’m 35 years old and have dealt with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, never really finding my place in the world. My family situation is complex: my father is demanding, emotionally unavailable, and preoccupied with money. While he has done some good things, he often uses emotional blackmail. My mother is distant, easily influenced, and unable to connect with her own emotions or with her children.

I am the main caregiver for my parents, which my brother exploits to disappear for months without so much as a phone call. This absence leads to increased pressure on me, with my parents, especially my father, taking out their frustration on me. He has even told me that I am a burden in his life.

My younger brother, after a troubled childhood, seemed to stabilize following years of therapy. However, at 27, he withdrew from life. For the past five years, he’s been living in a house owned by my parents without permission, largely absent except for sudden, violent appearances and threats of suicide. He accuses us of failing him and emotionally blackmails us, stealing money and creating an ongoing crisis.

Personally, I have endured a lot. Bullying during my childhood led to binge eating, which resulted in obesity for most of my life. This brought ongoing self-esteem issues, challenges in forming relationships, and repeated episodes of depression and anxiety. I also have a history of sexual abuse that has left both emotional and physical scars, including chronic vulvar pain and lichen sclerosus from untreated infections in my youth. Despite all this, forming healthy friendships has always been difficult because I lacked positive role models growing up. My only romantic relationship was traumatic, and I am still recovering from it.

Over the years, I have struggled with intense suicidal thoughts—not as a cry for help, but because I felt unvalued and unloved, as if I didn’t matter to anyone. This desperation pushed me to seek help from numerous psychologists, but the results have been disheartening. During the pandemic alone, I went through four therapists, and this year, I’ve seen two. One therapist I stayed with for 2.5 years, but I had to leave because he judged me for taking a leave from work and pressured me to find another job, even making inappropriate comments about my brother. The second therapist insisted that I report my brother to have him committed, which only added more stress.

Recently, I started seeing a new therapist, but once again, I feel disappointed. She forgets important details, interrupts me when I’m speaking, and makes inappropriate comments. She hasn’t shown basic empathy, even after I shared details about my physical health problems that have significant psychological impacts. Although she practices EMDR effectively, the first part of the sessions feels disconnected, and her attitude lacks validation. As a patient, you can tell when someone isn’t fully present, which is disheartening.

I am currently on medical leave due to mental health issues, but I am required to return to work next Monday, and I fear that I will be dismissed. This week marks my final session with my current therapist, but I already know I cannot continue with her.

At this point, I feel very lost and unable to see a way forward, either with therapy or in general. I share my experience hoping that someone can relate or offer support. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Thank you for reading! ",depression

"Things I tend to do/feel * When I'm out with friends/Family, I have so much fun, and feel great about myself, but when I'm back home in my room is goes down the drain. 
* I feel guilty when the weather is nice, but I stay home.
* I nap to make the days go by faster. 
* I am proud of my friends when they achieve/do something for themselves, but It makes me hate myself even more.
* I trauma dump in a way that makes it look like I'm just joking.
* I'm no longer religious.
* I won't buy food for myself or clothes because of finances and trying to be more responsible, but then I'll buy a $42 vape and call it a day. 
* Quitting vaping will probably make me feel a lot better, but I've convinced myself that it's the only thing that is actively making feel good.
* I used to make fun of people that were going through depression and the likes when I was younger (not directly). But I've now come to understand that it isn't all just bullshit.
* I try to help my friends with their problems, but refuse aid for myself.
* Going to the gym/ losing weight and eating healthy isn't really doing anything for me. I still feel like shit
* I can't sleep because I pressure myself to sleep
* I should be proud of my achievements, and things I've done in life, and things that I am actively doing. but I don't feel proud. I tell myself that it's what a ""normal person should be doing"" or ""should have done already""
* I try taking accountability for my fuckups, but it's a lot easier to blame other people.
* Self deprecation makes me feel better about myself for some reason. Even though I know that it's only making it worse. 
* I've learnt that everyone has a story. Some worse than others, but a story none the less.
* I'm scared of dying. Fearful of death, but I don't want to be here anymore. Or maybe just disappear

"Frustrated with OCD-Powered Depression and Loneliness First, there's the loneliness.  The highlights are nothing special; little relationship experience or experience with women, can't meet new people, yadda yadda.  I understand that pinning my self-worth on being able to find a girlfriend isn't a good idea.  For those who don't know why: 'getting a girlfriend' isn't a good goal because your control over it is so limited.  Still, it hurts.

In theory, I should be able to find value in myself and my existing relationships.  I do think that if I was meeting other goals that I'd feel better about myself.  I have ADHD, which makes any sort of focused effort difficult or arguably impossible.  My OCD also insists on incredibly high standards.  I'm absolutely merciless with myself.  I can never do anything well enough to feel satisfied.

I've always been very lonely.  I'm lucky now that I have good friends, but it just isn't enough for me.  I feel so hopeless on a day-to-day basis, my shortcomings and loneliness chasing each other around and around in my head.  It's quite maddening.  A big fear of mine is that I've taken too long trying to create the circumstances for me to be successful in life and as a result I've just missed my chance at love, or at hitting the heights of achievement that my personality demands.  Therapy, meds, years spent studying, all so that I could feel good about myself, but I can't even handle that.  I don't even believe in searching for ways to meet people because even if I could locate women I was attracted to, there's no way I'd try to forge a relationship with them.  Why would I expect them to want to date me?  I sure as hell wouldn't.

"Being in a relationship that plays a part in your depression/anxiety that you can't end. I'm curious if anyone else has experience being in a situation like mine and would be able to help me relate to someone.

"Already depressed and then losing someone from your support system. We met each other at a mental health hospital at the beginning of the year. She was there for a very different reason then the rest of us but we bonded pretty quickly. Not long after we'd both leave the hospital but kept in contact. We both needed that emotional support. Months would pass and I'd completely stop telling her about the bad things I had going on in life and how I actually felt. Would just deflect to a different topic even if she asked. She on the other hand would continue to do it and I did the same thing as before, I'd give her advice and console her. I didn't like telling her about my issues because i dont really like just trauma dumping on people. I have trust issues and in particular when it comes to women so i kept the majority of our friendship pretty 1 sided in terms of how ope 
and close we were. She'd grow to view me as an older brother or a father figure due to me being the only man in her life aside from her bf. I never really liked how she'd tell me that cause I knew it was an issue due to her having a bf so I never fed into it. Tbh I'd deflect to avoid continuing down that course which can lead to drama.....it did. She'd tell me one day how she got into an argument with her bf and he'd call her a bum for needing his car to go eat, go out, and go to work(they have the same job at his parents new fast food spot). The insults turned into pretty awful things such as wishing her head would be bashed in and she'd go incapable because then she'd be easier to deal with. That turned into threats as according to her she'd grab something that belonged to him and he told her to give it back or he'd hurt her. Thankfully he didn't but in the end he'd lock her out of where they essentially lived(the pool house of his parents home) and she'd cry for awhile before he let her back in. Same as always I'd give her advice as I knew she did some things that didn't help in this argument of theirs but I also had to voice my anger over what was said. After a few days she'd tell me she can't talk to me anymore as she was told by him that she couldn't or else they'd break up. He had read the messages by going through her phone and gave the ultimatum. She was crying over this but I told her it was OK and maybe for the best. In an attempt to make herself feel better she'd tell me she'd only block me on her phone but stay in my social media without talking. I didn't really see how that'd help because if he found out we followed each other that'd create another problem. So I told her I'd block her and she grew even more sad and thought I must've been angry. I didn't feel any anger but it did hurt. She was apart of my support system. Whenever I felt low she was one of the people if contact. Never did I tell her what I felt or what caused it. Id keep it to simple small talk so most of our convos were just filled with laughter. I miss the friend that I had so I just used this along with the actual things that drove me to become depressed to continue my weight loss goal.

"i saved my boyfriend from suicide but i sometimes wish it didnt have to be me 
dont get me wrong, i (17F) love my boyfriend (16M). im so relieved he’s alive and i got to be there for him. but lately i feel more anxious and exhausted ever since the night it almost happened.  my boyfriend  is the sweetest boy i ever met. he was my bestfriend for 8 months before confessing and we secretly had feelings for eachother that whole time. we have only been dating for 2 months and it ended up being the darkest time of his life. but i know im not the reason, he has been battling with depression and anxiety his whole life. we just happened to start dating this time.

it happened on the night he was grounded by his dad and emailed me on his school laptop (phone was taken away) he said he really needed to talk so we zoom called. i answered and he was hyperventilating and crying, he told me about how much he couldnt take it anymore and had these pills laid out on his desk. i was terrified, i begged him to put the pills away as he continued crying. it took a while but i began to hear him put the pills back into the bottle. i asked again and made sure he put them away. he said he did, and he went off saying he would be back and left to the bathroom. he was there for so long i was terrified he took the pills, and i remember shaking and crying his name to answer me. in a panic i ran around my room and went to my mom and asked if i should call the cops which she said she doesnt know. i was panicking and terrified because he still wasnt responding. as i was about to call 911 he finally came back, and i nearly considered to not call them until he began having a very bad panic attack. i tried helping him calm down but i knew this was beyond me. i was so unsure what to do, and finally decided to call 911. my boyfriend was so scared when i told him i was getting him help to make sure he was safe. and it hurt me so much when he said he didnt want me to just because he was scared his dad would get mad. he deserves help and its terrible his dad didnt listen to him and it had to come to this point. 

i talked to the operator, and explained everything. they went to his house and helped him. but never reached out to me that night if he was okay and safe. so i was by myself in my own thoughts after my boyfriend hung up and the operator. it was the worst night i have had. i have never been so scared to lose someone like that, never felt so anxious in my life. thankfully the next morning he reached out after coming back from the hospital to talk to me.

he always tells me how i am the only person he can talk to about his mental health most comfortably, and how he relies on me. he does has other support systems now though, like his therapists and adults or friends in his life. yet ever since that night i noticed ive been very off. i consider myself to be pretty in control of my thoughts and emotions, but now i find myself feeling more anxious about little things in our relationship, and being mad at him or having serious conversations more often than usual. im always worried about him, and need to constantly make sure hes okay and im making him happy. which has honestly been slowly draining me. he talks a lot about his mental issues with me, and i always support him. now its been affecting me too though, and i get anxious thoughts that i usually never get. he knows this too. and offered breaking up so that im okay. but i told him i loved him for who he is and nothing could change the way i feel, so he cant make me go away. 

i know i saved him and its why hes alive today. so how do i stop this guilt i feel for feeling like i wish it wasnt me to save him from near death? should i see a therapist? i dont know if i should because he didnt actually commit suicide. but i’m feeling like its been affecting me and our relationship a lot, and i dont want to break up with him but i also dont want to keep feeling anxious and drained.",depression

Earlier in school I was very alone and I don't used to have friends. This is because at first guys tend to get impressed and get friendly with me. But as time passes what suddenly happens they start ignoring me and trolling/roasting me 😞. I don't know why this pattern always continues that at first a person gets friendly with me and gets close then starts ignoring and roasting. Now I am a musician(singer,instrumentalist and composer also). So as soon as i joined music club everyone was friendly and one guy in first year told me to form our 1st years band but later he just ignored me 🥺and never ever gave a chance to come to the band which he formed ! Then I Just formed another band with other guys ! But still those guys in the first band always troll me indirectly. Its like that band formed first So as a first mover advantage they always gets some advantage from seniors not directly but indirectly ! But I and my band never 😔. So majority of my batch is in that band So i feel so leftover. Like why ? What do I do . 


Same thing in my music class... I used to be a great singer in my class and my teacher always used to appreciate me but due to pressure of studies and other things i couldn't continue classes ! Now in my 2nd year I started attending those classes again to complete my degree but yes due to lack of some pratice and observation from my teacher I developed some imperfections and wrong techniques. Now yesterday some seniors brothers made fun of that 🥺. I don't feel like to leave.


Same with my close friend in college.  He and me were best friends but another guy got in contact with us and soon he was giving priority to that guy rather than me and that other guy also started roasting!😔

Yesterday a music event was there a senior and my friend genuinely tried to ask and convince me to sing and they were so good because I never got that treatment and everyone used to ignore me.in the club 😔. But you know what the others singers were practicing not noticing me (sitting in a corner alone watching ) and I couldn't perform . And those two guys who asked me were busy in organizing the event so i couldn't 🥺.

I play keyboard also good ! But there exist a lead keyboardist who was just playing rhythm which I can easily play but guess what no one asked me to come and play. She played for 8 songs. I wanted just one because I am not like a keyboardist who is beginner and I always play in pratice sessions with appreciation but at the end time other one who is professional comes and dominates. Obviously that will happen but in club every instrumentalist gets a chance but why not I ?

"Can depression manifest only in chronic fatigue ?  4 years ago (2020) I was diagnosed with burnout/depression/anxiety, they didn't really know. I complained about a sudden onset of brain fog, DPDR, depression, insomnia, light/noise sensitivity, tachycardia, tremors, hot flashes etc. Like my body was stuck in flight or fight mode. 

After trying 7 antidepressants with no success on my main symptoms, towards the end of 2021 a psychiatrist suggested my symptoms were likely due to long COVID. I got refered to a long covid clinic and they diagnosed me. 

But thing is, there is no accurate way to diagnose long covid (my serology was indeed positive) bu like depression it is based on symptoms and elimination criteria. But the symptoms are the same. 

I was asked to stop Venlafaxine, 2 years later my symptoms haven't worsened but they didn't improved neither. I am left with constant chronic fatigue, brain fog and some GI issues.

"I’m losing my shit and I don’t know what to do  I don’t really know where to start ,for the last 6 months I have been feeling like shit , you know depression ,anxiety ,loneliness, anger and plain sadness all stacked up at the same time, to make things clearer  i have been struggling with loneliness for a while i mean besides work all i do is sit in my god damn room browsing insta or reddit all day long because i simply have nothing to do , the thing is i do have a couple of  friends though but besides going to the same damn coffee house each time they don,t want to do anything else and its making me frustrated and hate being around them because to be honest i still feel alone around them and bored ,and im so tired of living the same day and the same routine each and everytime ,and i don’t get invited anywhere by anyone else ,i’ve always been invisible to other people which is making me feel even more alone , now what made this even worse is me having a huge crush on this girl from work ,and talking to her is the only exciting thing going on in my life and the only thing thats making me happy  but knowing how fucked my mental state at the moment is i couldn’t make a move and ask her out because  also guess what , i have severe anxiety and low self esteem and never been in a relationship in my life (im 24 btw  and im terrified of asking her out because i know i cant function when im anxious but i know i ll regret it for the rest of my life  ) which thinking about it is making me despise myself even more and despise how helpless and such a loser i’am which is making my depression also worse . Now to add to all of this my eyesight is getting worse because i have been diagnosed with  keratoconus so now there’s also the stress and fear of my vision deteriorating even more then it already has (ps : due to keratoconus i also can’t drive at night which is definitely not helping with my whole dating and crush situation lol) , you think this is over? No its not ive also been having family issues which i don’t want to get into details with but they re making shit worse for sure .
All of this together is really having its toll on me and i’m just tired , i’m also an engineering student besides working as a software dev so add in the stress from work and exams and everything and its a recipe for a disaster ,i’m literally on the verge of a mental breakdown and I don’t know how the hell i’m supposed to keep going
I dont know what kind of advice im looking for honestly so i’ll consider everything , i just wanted to let all this out somewhere and to someone so here it is :’) and thanks",depression

"Body depression and the wonders of the human mind Hello all, I wanna start by prefacing that this could all be inaccurate or wrong but I'll Saya my peace and be done with it.

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder back in 2021

I originally started going to the doctor because I was dealing with some GOD awful brain fog that was seeming from seemingly nowhere

At the time, I knew I had depression and anxiety but it didn't affect me at all, it was just a little bag of sad I carried with me everywhere I went.

Fast foward to now 2024, my brain fog has cleared mostly (yay) but it has been replaced with a HORRID feeling depression and I am now on 2 different meds for it.

My question is this, in the last sentence I said ""horrid feeling"" and that's because I've found something weird with my depression- or so I think, my mind, like inside my brain, is calm, completely fine, loves myself, and nothing is really going wrong in my life and I've never really had trauma..HOWEVER my BODY feels depressed and exhausted and ONLY my body, it's not just a sick feeling, like I know it's depression just cause it's so heavy and taxing and everything feels off.

Have any of you experienced this? Is this a thing or am I going crazy? Is there anything I can do?

Thanks!",depression

Is this life? Just after I turned 17, I woke up one day with this tightness in my chest, like a little weight settled right over my heart. I even have videos on my phone of me talking about how terrible I felt, not even knowing why. Now it’s been a bit over a year, and nothing has changed. I’ve accepted that happiness isn’t coming back I’ve worked hard to feel okay again, but that spark just won’t return.

I feel like my life is going to be wasted away i feel like i have been too aware for my whole life and have been so depressed for so long because of it. I dont want to live my life working forever but i know theres no other way.

Its making it so hard to go on with another month of working 5-6 days a week. im only 18 why do i feel this way. a part of me feels like its my fault i feel like this and i want attention. i feel awful for my boyfriend because hes the only one i talk to about this and i know it brings him down. hes basically the only one that can make me feel okay so when i cant see him i feel so much worse and normally results in me falling into bad habits which results in him getting upset at me for doing it. i dont know what to do anymore and its so hard to find something i want to do with my life. sorry for the long rant i just dont know what to do at this point. ,depression

No one wants me here. 
No one really cares.
I'm genuinely alone, no matter how hard I seem to try to make friends everyone leaves in the end, despite trying different approaches. I just can't seem to do it right. 
Maybe it's because I go through phases of wanting to speak, then burning myself out and wanting limited contact, but then I feel bad during those periods and want to speak again and it's a cycle. 

I also hate the way I look and everything I've done up to this point in my life. I feel like I've failed. I feel like I've done nothing worthwhile and am stuck in some loop of building myself up and falling again.

I genuinely hate all aspects about my life.

I also hate that sometimes, if I'm feeling happy, or just not sad, I worry about these feelings coming back but stronger. I worry about the thoughts of SH and ending my life. 
These thoughts become so strong sometimes I can't sleep because it's all I'm thinning about. 
To a point in which the other day I SH'd for the first time in a few years.

"I've gotten good at not ""seeming"" depressed. Because I know nobody cares. They think I've got no cause to feel sorry for myself and it doesn't make sense for me to be depressed. And they aren't wrong, but depression doesn't make sense and when I'm down in it ""you're on your own"" is hard to hear. So I put on a fake front and when they ask how I'm doing I say ""I'm doing fine"" because that's what they want to hear. They don't want to hear anything else.

They don't mind coming to cry on my shoulder, though. And then I have to brush them off, as gently as I can. Don't look to me for strength, I need every bit of it for myself. And when my strength isn't enough I stay away from people because solitude is what helps keep me grounded. Lately I'm needing a lot of time by myself. The meds aren't doing much for me anymore, but alternative meds have side effects I know I can't adjust to.

I know care providers are hard to come by, but it seems like all the ones I've had are struggling with their own issues and can't do anything for me but refill my meds. So this is my burden alone, and I'm used to that. I just keep grinding through.

That's all. I'm just posting this because I feel like I need to make it clear where I'm coming from. I'm not looking for advice, or any response to this post at all. Anyone looking for a bird with a broken wing to heal so they can feel like a hero should look somewhere else. ",depression

"I don’t know if I’m cut out for life. I’m 24. I’ve been depressed and suicidal for a decade with brief reprieves. I got brain surgery for treatment-resistant seizures, did four years of college (enjoyed the first two years up until 2020), tried student teaching and dropped out, and now I work retail. I started out doing so well and working 40 hours/week. When I ran into a difficult manager, I switched departments in the store and cut my hours to 30 hours/week. My parents didn’t think I would “make it” working a FT job, but only because they know my history and care about me. 

I was and still am worried I won’t make it, either. The mental illness is only getting worse, the seizures won’t ever stop, and I have no social ties besides my family. And no desire to have any ties due to social anxiety and agoraphobia. My brain has a circuit that just defaults to suicide as the answer. As the holidays approach, I’ve been thinking about planning my death. I’m honestly so ungrateful. Every day I wake up, my morning routine is to mutter “goddammit, not again” and hit snooze.

I’ve had episodes of anxiety and agoraphobia in my life, and I’m in the middle of one now. I’m so sick of being alive; what has all my suffering been for? I’ve been getting this feeling of internalized anger lately.

Send me video with time stamp. Mean while my daughter whom I had custody of left to go back to her mom’s 1800 miles away. 
I gradually walked into another relationship. With someone I have known more than half of my life. We both fall deep. With everything going on I have entered a dark part of my life.

"The lingering feeling is getting so much worse again Hello there everyone,
I’m gonna start off by saying I was at a therapist but she never really told me if I reallt am depressed I guess?
Moving on to my point, this lingering depression of mine is getting so much worse again. I’ve had this feeling mixed with overwhelmed anxiety since before the pandemic and really need to know what I can do. The best I can give an example of is how the author of “I want to die but I want to eat tteokkbokki” described the feeling in the prologue. It’s a great book if you don’t know it.

Basically I’ve tried everything—from therapy to stone/meditation therapy, from off time to trips, the only thing I never tried was medication because, as I said, my therapist never really got into talking about that.
I can’t explain the feeling well I just hate everything. Litterly everthing. My parents, my workplace, my sister and anything else. Hobbies are getting extremely boring again and all I wanna do is sleep and cry.
I’ve had this before and barely managed to get back into life—this was barely a year ago. 

Safe to say as a 15-year old who is legally required to either work or go to a school with specific interest, this is the absolute worst. I don’t have any passion about anything anymore at this point. I can’t talk to my mom about it because she has brushed me off all my life until i wanted to go to a psych ward on my own. She got me a therapist that didn’t help me at all and just kinda- brought me down? 
I feel like such a failure for not having any goals, I waste my time away but I know I just need a break of life. At least where I am right now—mentally and physically.

Sorry about the rant but I just really need someone to help me, I litterly can’t even get out of bed anymore. What can I try?:(",depression

Every single day I’m snapping. I genuinely feel like I am losing my sanity. My parents never stop yelling at each other. My mom screams at me every day about how I’m not enough and how I’m lazy and ruining my future and I never listen to her.

The issues that she’s talking about are not even close to as big as she makes them. I missed a deadline for like one scholarship and she’s saying I’m missing out on thousands of dollars and it’s all my fault even though I never heard about this deadline and neither did many of my friends because our counselor never mentioned it.

My grades are falling because of how hard school has gotten. I can’t keep up with this work. It’s too much. I can’t balance it all along with plan for college as well, it’s all falling apart part and I can’t stay on top of it and I just get screamed at more and more and more and more

When she yells it’s like it’s life or death, she’s like flailing around and almost in tears and growling through her teeth and it’s all over high school and trying to apply to colleges.

I’m only happy when I’m at school, and I never in a thousand years thought I’d say that because I genuinely despise school. But there im away from my parents. I can talk to my friends or the girl I’m going to date soon and it’s just a break.

But when I come home it’s the same every day. I sit in my dark room and stare at a wall and whisper to myself about how I wish things were different or how I can’t stand anything anymore.

They couldn’t care less about the small things about me. They don’t ask me how things are going. Nobody wants to know anything about me because they don’t actually like me.

What they like about me is the things I can do for them. Giving them emotional support, being someone who replies right away, reliable. I’m the person they can go to when nobody else is there. 

And of course, boyfriends only like me for my appearance.

Co workers are only nice to me because I do a good job and will take their shifts for them.

But what would happen if I had become let’s say disabled, couldn’t walk and had my looks ruined. I can no longer do all those things for them anymore. And of course they would stop talking to me because I am no longer useful to them anymore. Not one person would stay with me because it didn’t matter what exactly I could do for them, but how impactful I make their life.

Sometimes, I want to smash every mirror in my house and delete all my social media. I’ve never struggled with these feelings as much as I do now, and it’s all-consuming. Seeing friends and people around me getting married makes it even harder. I’ve never been approached by a guy or even flirted with, and it makes me wonder if it’s all because of how I look.

I'm rejected by romantic partners and friends constantly even though I try to be as kind as I can. This just leads to me being taken advantage of and is starting to make me feel like real trash. I don't want to go on. I have an appt with my psychiatrist next Wednesday, but what? Increased dosages? Med changes? Adding more meds? I take 4 for psychiatric conditions already. I feel lonely and isolated and unloved and today I'm feeling it more starkly than usual. Basically my only reason for living is that someone needs to take care of the cat. My only family are my parents and they live far away and even I can't get along with them for more than 2 weeks if I were to stay with them (psychiatric issues on their end, especiallymy mother). My parents think and treat me like I am an invalid. That is the only way they can cope and explain my problems. Part of it is me and part of it is being chronically misunderstood and just not worth anyone's effort.

Been dealing with anxiety since I was a child, depression/self harm since I was 12, medicated since 15 and am a 2 attempt chump (24 & 30). I'm 35 now.

For reference, I am diagnosed with bipolar I (depressive type), features of BPD, and anxiety (meaning basically all anxiety disorders - GAD, social anxiety, OCD, agoraphobia, other phobias, etc). Probable PTSD, but haven't been formally diagnosed. I have a psych degree so I know everything about my disorders and treatment options. Just can't seem to apply them consistently to myself.

Not to say there hasn't been improvement. Haven't cut since I was 29. Prozac was a real game changer after my second attempt at 30 and still has an insulating effect, just not always and today is especially bad. Feel like killing myself, but know an attempt would likely just land me in the hospital with brain damage (like the other 2 times), so not a serious consideration. Mostly just want to die and bedrotting.

I just feel worthless and wish I could just disappear. If I died in my apartment, nobody would even notice until the smell started. The only reason I'd be discovered earlier than that is if my mother threw a fit about a welfare check on me.",depression
"Not wanting to change, is it a sign of depression? I took on a new role at Google from my previous role at vmware(acquired by Broadcom)
Took about 55% cut, it's insane but it felt right at the moment...(I was so confident to join Google that I didn't even do the comparison of my potential earnings)
I'm not able to get over the losses, I've a child with ASD, felt it's better for me to be in a stable job instead of being in a place where there are constant layoffs. 

Now: 
Everyday is being wasted by ""I should have stayed back to earn more thoughts""
I even approached my previous management but looks like they do not have any reqs open now, due to acquisition they are looking at more layoffs or resignations but not hiring..

I had this crazy idea of moving out but dint really want to take it with such a huge paycut until the idea was reinforced by a couple of former colleagues (may be I was gaslit)

I feel so shameful to have lost such a huge money with my self doubting mind set. 

Now I'll continue to second-guess myself for life..

"I don’t know how to help my mom with her depression.  This is probably gonna be a little rough to read lol this is being written after a fight and I’m just feeling lost and unsure about how I can even help. I feel guilty for her being depressed because most of her problems stem from becoming a SAHM. Ik it wasn’t in my control but it’s hard not to when she talks about it being her biggest regret in life. She became a SAHM when me and my siblings were born bc she had a bad home life growing up and wanted us to have a present mom. She was a good mom and I’m thankful to have had parents that wanted to be around us growing up however now that we’re all grown up my mom is struggling. That decision has cost her from having a career as she’s been out of work now for 20+ years. She’s bored at home, has no friends, hates where we live (florida) and has no hobbies. 

Growing up I was always the therapist child who my parents told all their problems to (prob bc im the only girl lol). She has told me my entire life all about how much she hates my dad and how she can’t wait to die bc she’s so lonely and tired. Because she doesn’t have a job she has no money and can’t get a divorce bc she’d have nowhere to go. Their relationship isn’t abusive it’s just loveless. I try suggesting therapy, finding a hobby, at least TRYING to get a job (she insists it’s too late and doesn’t want to try) and at this point have no idea what to do. It’s extremely hard growing up and hearing about how miserable ur parents are 24/7 and having no power to change it. She doesn’t have support to turn to for these things so I feel like I need to help or listen to her but it’s just hard to hear. I’ve tried setting boundaries in the past that this isn’t healthy for her to tell me about their lack of a sex life and all their marital troubles but that makes it worst because she starts crying about being an awful mom and self isolates. She’s constantly mentioning wanting to kill herself (idk how serious she is or if it’s a call for help) and I am just so lost on what to do. This is also really affecting my own mental health and I don’t know how to help.

"I’m bored out of my mind I used to try to fix my addictions and everything, but gave up a couple months ago.
Then after just indulging in all my desires nothing feels interesting anymore, I don’t have anything I desire, or anything that gives me any feeling whatsoever.

"Emptyness, Sadness and Sorrow I look into the mirror and sometimes I feel I'm not ugly, I can be attractive, other times I just feel so inadequate and not so good looking since I'm always single and even when I date and try to find a new guy, all seems well at first and then the magic disappear for no reason honestly. I do believe it's better living in my own bubble, enjoying my fantasy in my bedroom, watching movies, spending sólo time alone as always, talking to myself, only interacting with people out there (at work and other small scenarios) and that it, return and go home in the darkness of my shade, hiding in my shell, closed up and only open up for myself and then repeat the same routine again the next day like pretending I have another life. A life that I could be successfully beautiful, with a fabulous red hair, dark blonde, light brown, amber, copper or green eyes, more extroverted and funny, great personality and goal oriented in any career. Other person that's is not me. It's wasted. I don't even know what I want to buy I guess I could be a good partner to somebody and even I have received compliments from other guys (online) I jumped the conclusion (after being ghosted several times) that they only said that because they have to say something and enjoy deceiving people (on the apps and real life) and that makes me reconsider that I'm not attractive after all. I'm averagely tall and skinny and pale but I'm not enjoying this person out and in that I am today. It's like when I close my eyes or ""dream"" awake, I want to believe I'm another person, way more interesting, prettier, funnier and better in exchange. It won't matter the genre/sex. I could choose a man or woman (perhaps a woman better) with entirely physical traits and better in everything and the saddest thing it that I am attached to this body and sohl for the rest of my life withkut even a single chance to enjoy the company of a good good looking man with great character like my ideal dream guy. I know that's never gonna happen and better start to get used to it from now on but I simply can't forget this feeling. It outcome my possibilities and brings me unhappiness. I really wish I was that girl/woman or boy/man and could choose and finally accept myself. I take some selfies and kinda like it with the right angle and post them but I remember this is not ""me"" inside and wish I could erase my identity once and for all  I'm sad. ",depression
"I’ve just realised how entitled I’ve been and I hate myself for it I’ve just realised how entitled I’m being and I am really disappointed in myself but I don’t know how to change it. I genuinely didn’t realise it until today, and I thought I was pretty aware of my flaws, but my mom told me I was being entitled.

I get very suicidal a lot of the time and I have the attitude of “I didn’t ask to be born so why should I suffer and stick around just so other people aren’t sad?”. But I’ve realised this has also made me have the attitude that being alive and just surviving and being pretty lazy is enough and I get really frustrated (internally) when people put pressure on me to do more with my life and in my head all I can think is “I don’t even want to be here and I’m sticking around to stop other people grieving so why should I do more?”.

I’m really beating myself up over this because I didn’t realise how shitty this was, and honestly it’s just making the whole thing worse. I know outside of this I am a kind person and I do my best to help other people.

Does anyone relate/have any advice? 
Thank you.

"Falling deep down into depression again  I made it so far. I thought I was healed, genuinely. I would continue struggling with my other mental health issues, but my depression was better, I thought. Recent life events have sent me straight down into the hole. I can’t feel anything. I’m so fucking depressed. I’m suicidal, and I am actually considering it for the first time in 3 years. I know after my previous stint in the mental health system that help doesn’t exist. I got better on my own, and now I’m so far down I don’t think I can bring myself back. And there’s no help. Nothing I can do, except ponder whether or not to actually kill myself. There’s nothing for me nothing I can do. I am so depressed and I honestly forgot how horrible it was. I spent my childhood depressed, I’m 20 almost 21 now and I’ve been better in my adult years because I got out of my abusive situation. But I just lost all my friends bc my friend’s gf is jealous of me is basically the story. And it has caused me to spiral. I don’t know what to do. This is horrible. ",depression

There are many reasons as to why im struggling mentally. One of my main reasons is my poor academic performance. I've been 100% honest with my parents as to why im struggling besides the fact I havent told them Im struggling academically. 

i was an A student all the way up until my first semester freshman year of college and for some reason everything fell apart for me from there. i figured that I could get it together academically on my own since I was a successful student in the past. I havent figured it out yet though and now i dont even know if i will. 

My GPA is a 2.2 (2.5 required to graduate), ive failed two classes and it looks like im about to fail a third (fucking calculus). My academic advisor told me that if I fail another class, there is a chance i get kicked out of school.

I wish i would've approached them when I was struggling originally now, but I was so afraid of the response from my parents that I didn't do it.

Aside from my parents, I don’t think many people will be sad once I’m gone. There will be the initial sadness, but it’ll be over pretty fast.

I've never been to a club in my life it's like i don't know how to have fun, when i do meet someone i'm just quiet and i force myself to talk so that i'm not super wierd but all i do is say something stupid. I'm so sick of being alone like i litteraly can't take it anymore, i geel so fucking miserable and empty and tiered all the time. And i am trying but nothing is working, i tought when i get a job i will meet new people there and have a friend, well i got the job and at the job everyone is way older then me and an asshole, then i wanted to lear guitar and i started attenting leassons and i taught i will meet someone there but i habe 1on1 leassons so i rearly see anyone there and everyone at that school is better then me and yes i know i just started but i just feel like i don't belong there. Also what i regret not going to collage like i feel less worthy then people that go to collage i mean in defenetly not smart but maybe if i did go i would find friends there and have a better job i wouldn't hate. Also it makes me supper sad watching people traveling and having fun with their friends cuz i know i will never have that or i'd have to lie to them about the gay thing. Another thing i struggle with is sex, i mentioned i had one hookup and i am not a fan of hookups but i forced myself to do it just to lose my virginity, i felt less worthy then everonye else beacuse of my lac of experience like i'm a child or something, and it wasn't near my home town and i don't even know the guys name anymore (also i wish we at least stayed in touch but he wasn't very interested). I just feel like im not even human sometimes, like i'm stuckin in some cycle of misery that i can't escape and i will never be happy... suicide tought come to me like it's a joke, at least once a day i imagine what would it be like hanging myself or throwing myself of a high bulding, who would miss me? I don't think anyone would not truly ok my parents maybe but we are not super close like the other familys are, we barely talk and my mom often has a drinking problem and even if i did kill myself would they miss me as much if they new i was gay. I just feel so fucking alone and these past few days are worse for some reason and i don't see a remotly happy ending for me. 
Like i'm single, no friends, i'm not interesing, not good at anything... what is the point then, what am i living for... to go to work??? That i hate with people that keep reminding me i'm not good enough... i rraly see no point in all of this anymore",depression

"I care less and less... I don't wanna do this again, I don't wanna go down this rabbit-hole that I've tried to work myself out of for the last 4 years.

I don't have any drive, no motivation and no hope that anything will get better. I don't wanna think like this but it feels impossible not to...

Recently I've started to care less and less about my friends, their lives and whatever they're doing. I don't think they're that great anymore, we don't connect anymore, we do stuff together which either of us don't care much bout anymore. The friendships I hold onto so dearly are fake, it's not real, they don't even know I'm struggling, why tell them they won't even care. And before anyone tells me that they do, they don't... I've reached out before, asking for the bare minimum like ""invite me if you ever have a slot open"", really very bare minimum stuff. Yet they never invite me, I ask them if we're fine, they reassure me everything is but yet I'm never included in their lives. I've started to grow a lot of resentment to the people around me, I just feel like they don't get it. They don't ever try to help me, even when I mask my problems to make sure they won't get too affected and still they complain. Whenever I do take off the mask, giving in asking for some sort of sympathy I always feel ignored, they always tell me i'm ""too negative"", but I don't even let them see that side of me!? Literally I'm always the person who make the jokes, keeps the conversations going etc, I used to be more negative back in the day towards people but I just mask that stuff now. I don't ever let them see that side of me, or at least barely, how would they even know? I'm just so tired of it honestly, I just care less and less. ",depression

"I hate my life and I don't know what else to try to make it better I got SAed as a child by a family member and diagnosed with depression at 15.

I am now 23. I have been into therapy for a year now. I am also taking anti depressants. I try to keep myself as healthy and active as possible. 

I moved abroad a few months ago. I have a full time job here and make more money than my parents ever made (which is actually not enough when you try to maintain an social life in an expensive city nowadays). They are really proud of me. I am completing a second master degree online and plan to move again next year to complete
a 3rd one onsite (I am already enrolled).

I read books and listen to podcasts about mental health, self improvement, self love, relationship, manifestation ... anything you can think of. I try to work on myself as much as possible, be a good listener, be a better person/daughter/sister/friend.

I travel abroad for vacation at least once a year, which is a privilege. Often solo travelling. I solo traveled 4 times last year.
I attend concerts multiples times a year. I have amazing friends.

I attend sport classes twice a week and have a drink with my coworkers at least twice a once. I am also part of a girls group who organise events and I attend once a month to meet new people (wine tasting, ceramic painting, picnics, boat parties, candle making, movies night, etc.... huge variety of events). I try to be social. I also go to those ""timeleft"" diners once in a while. I do not use this app that much tho.

I speak 4 languages (not all fluently but enough for work/ daily conversations) and I am currently learning a 5th one.

I am conventionally attractive. I try to take care of myself (Skin care, hair care, spa once a month, nails).

With all of that, I still do not like my life. I find myself boring and I hate the way I look. I would like to litteraly disappeared. I always feel sad and empty. I am never enough. I always want more and to be a better person : be more fun, more smart, more pretty. 

I have never been in a relationship (only situationships) and men do not even look my way. Which is fine, male validation shouldn't be important for me but I have to admit I get envious of other girls who get all the attention and are effortlessly nice to hang out with.

I get attached to people really fast, which allow me to get hurt very often. I am over sensitive.

Most people my age do not really like me. I am always the one who find excuse to not go clubbing (deep down I hate it) or spend too much on alcohol (I could spend 100 euros in alcohol per night but my cheap ass refused to).

I do not know what else I can try to be better n'a more important: feel better. Any advices or tips is welcomed.

"I can't stop thinking about it. Yesterday morning , my fiance and I got kicked out of our place. My aunt who had always been by my side snapped and yelled horrible things at me. Blaming me for the 3K she CHOSE to spend on MY MOTHER no matter how many times back then I told her she didn't have to, that we'd be safe even if we get evicted, we had my fiances familys place to go to if we did(his fam wants us there for company). Well my mom lost her job and my fiance and I couldn't afford everything by ourselves so we broke the apartment contract and moved in with my aunt. We were originally gonna go live at my fiances family's place but my aunt INSISTED we move in with her so we can save better for our own car then move out to the place we have planned for our final moving place. That's really when things went downhill. She was a horrible house cleaner, her grown ass kids were horrible roommates but she never cared about what she or her kids did ok that's  your immediate family makes sense.But she apparently really cared if we messed up simple things. Here's some examples when she finally snapped yesterday before kicking us out: she said(screamed more like it) that i was manipulative because I claimed she did not set her boundaries before we moved in with her. She never communicated the rules like not leaving a dog blanket on the floor for the dog, not buying groceries ourselves for everyone, not bringing home free food. She hated apparently when we did that and never communicated that with us until she snapped.so apparently I'm the piece of shit manipulator(as she yelled at me). And as I stated earlier, she blamed ME for the money she spent on my mom and the fact we brought over our dog, blamed ME for the dog when my mom was the one who bought the damn dog when I told her we weren't financially stable for a dog. Blamed me for literally everything. And ok yeah why should I care if I get blamed for everything when I know it's not true? Her fucking reaction and way she snapped at me was horrid. She did not have to yell at me about how I'm a piece of shit. She did not have to blame me for everything and not let me have a say. Let's just say, her reaction and behavior was so bad that my fiance had to step in and he never does. He's come from a trauma filled past so he's used to abuse and stuff but he actually stepped in and defended me there when he hardly says a word against my family. And idk I keep telling myself that what my aunt said isn't true, i should just ignore everything it's not like I'm around her anymore. But I can't stop thinking about it. It's probably all true.",depression
"Oppurtunity I'm sitting here at work thinking about the flickering flames of myself after my wife leaving me a couple months ago.

My friends are distant and my family is pretty distant too. I'm alone again and starting to think about the best thing to do. I have huge amounts of debt because if decisions I've made and I have noone to care or to love me. I should start over, i should make new friends or just live my life.

Lately Ive just been in a really bad rut where I really don't have the energy or motivation to do literally anything. I get home, eat trash food because I dont want to cook and just veg.

A bit of backstory, I used to weigh 400 pounds but managed to get myself down to 220, but now even looking back instead of satisfaction or pride, I just feel like it was a waste. I'm never going to be able to achieve a 'look' that I find attractive and can only just see a blob no matter what I do. Ive gained about 40lbs back now and its just cementing the fact even further because aside from tighter clothes, I dont see any difference. Its all disgusting.

I work with the public and see all sorts of people and cant help but compare myself to them. I know its not right, healthy or nice but I hate them. I hate that they have something I have tried so hard for and want so badly and will simply never have.

I dont want to end it, I want to find the value, I want to find my own personal win but everything is just reinforcing the fact that no matter what, its just not meant to be.

"Life is something. Remember when you were a child, you were promised all these dreams. When you were asked ""what do you wanna be when you grow up"" you most likely already had an answer. Maybe you wanted to be a doctor, an artist, a singer, a fireman, the opportunities were endless! And the best part was... everyone said it all could become true.

Now years later you're grown up and everyone around you is telling you to ""grow up"", ""you're not a child get an adult job"", ""it's impossible just give up!""... Where did that curiosity go? Where did those dreams go and why are everyone suddenly so against achieving them?

You're now in your apartment, alone, wishing you lived a different life... Maybe you're walking around circling for hours daydreaming away to a different life where you are what you dreamt of being as a child. You still carry that dream, you still deeply want it, but no one believes in you, maybe you don't even believe in yourself anymore. 

While you're dreaming of being anything imagination brings, you're at the same time telling other people that the dreams are unreachable. You're still telling others to ""grow up and get an adult job"". We are the creators of the circle, we are the creators of the demolishment of our dreams. We don't believe anymore, we dream but the belief that anything is possible is gone.

"A friend of mine is truly struggling with depression right now and I just need advice  A girl I met roughly 2 months ago and I have become incredibly close lately. Recently, she opened up to me about some very terrible things she's been through that she has trauma from. She also has very strong depression or at least depression symptoms from the traumas she's endured.

Yesterday, she decided that she needs to self isolate from pretty much everyone to get her mental health straightened and of course I respected her choice. Apparently she's done this before and unintentionally ghosted people but she cares about me enough to where she doesn't wanna do that to me which is why she told me. Still, I'm just extremely worried because she's come to me with suicidal thoughts even just in the time I've known her.

I myself have struggled with depression most of my life, never to the extent she is right now tho. Not to play the ""suffering Olympics"" or anything. I'm honestly not sure how to help her other than simply giving her the space she says she needs. She promised to eventually come back to me so that gives me a bit of hope, and the fact that she's done this before and came back stronger. 

In general I just simply need advice on dealing with this situation. It's weighing heavily on me because I care about her a lot, she's probably the best person I've met in a long time honestly. She doesn't deserve any of this but I know mental health doesn't care what you ""deserve"".",depression

"There is no one who can help me I developed an extreme case of contamination OCD when I was around 14 years old. It started with repetitive hand-washing and over the years turned into a massive illness with multiple roots and branches that are all causing different kinds of torment

I started to be extremely lazy, depressed, and very suicidal. I turned from someone who was very good at school to someone who basically never attended and left with horrible grades. I left school around 4.5 years ago, and had to deal with two heartbreaks in this time, the last one specifically leaving me traumatized, full of fear and insane, long-lasting suffering. I had no way out of it, loving like a dog while being treated like a mutt and discarded, begging for the smallest attention while having to see, hear and experience extremely heartbreaking things which are so horrible to me that I can’t even mention them

My illness and suffering has left me scarred, often unable to comprehend my thoughts and emotions, and helpless even if help would be available. Doctors were never able to help me, instead they made me lose all my trust in them. I am extremely treatment resistant, not even strong medication like tranquilizers have an effect on me. I’m not even able to properly lay in my bed at this point, and not wanting to get out at all. I’m malnourished and haven’t left my apartment in months. I pray to God every day and it feels like I’m meant to suffer, that this is all my life will bring me

I know that I need help, urgently, and a lot of it, but I’m at a point where there is no motivation to talk to anyone, and I’m too scared and unable to reach out or ask for help. I know that people don’t care, and they won’t understand me. My girlfriend can’t do much for me either, my suffering makes her sad and unable to really help me, and sometimes I need to be quiet because the things I would say would hurt her and just cause problems. I only have her too, there is only one friend I have but we don’t talk

I’m scared of not being able to move my way back home (my limbs literally not wanting to move) over the last year, when I think about moving my body. I just feel weird about it. Like, how do I move? How am I able to move? That gets me all weird and scared i that won’t be able to move anymore. Like my brain just can’t do it anymore.

Whenever I see someone kill themselves on the news I get scared. What if I become like that one day? What if I lose control one day and do something weird? 

Other than that, the thoughts can also intensify at school, or when I’m with someone. Like, what if I punch this person right now or what if I just pull my pants down? My thoughts are always there and it’s hard to avoid. I’m hopeless, and don’t know what to do. I don’t wanna feel like this, I just want to live a normal life not rotting in bed all day. However, when I’m gaming or doing something intensive, my attention drifts away and I don’t think about it. 
Also, weirdly enough, whenever I feel uncomfortable, I get the urge to touch myself. Idk why this is.

These annoying thoughts, combined with panic attacks, make it really difficult for me to function normally in this society. It’s stopping me from getting a job, or even attending school.

Is there anything I can do? Am I going crazy?

"I was molested as a child  I was molested when I was younger 

TRIGGER WARNING
Also this might be a long read sorry in advance. 
I (20)m was molested by my grandfather and raped by my sister when I was around the age of 6. We grew up in a poor household. My grandparents had custody of me since my mom was with her boyfriend and my dad was in jail at the time. I don’t want to go into detail because I don’t want to think about it but my grandfather was a mean and horrible old man. He was definitely a psychopath. He physically abused me and my sisters mentally, physically and sexually at least for me. Then after my grandfather did what he did to me my sister raped me 3 times or at least that’s the amount of times I remember. I didn’t tell anyone and still haven’t I’m far to embarrassed by it. The only comfort that I can take from this is that my grandfathers dead and my sister is in Prison now for an unrelated reason. I think the whole situation has fucked me up really badly because I’m shaking writing this rigt now. I can’t form relationships or talk to people without feeling uncomfortable. It’s not that I don’t like people I guess I’m afraid of others. I have female friends but never had a real relationship before. I’d like to go to therapy one day either that or I kill my self.

"Boredom is killing me  
I (19M) know the title of this post makes me sound like I'm being dramatic, but I'm serious, boredom is literally tearing me up inside. I do productive activities like drawing, writing, and going outside for a walk. But after I do those activities I feel so empty and drained to the point where I feel like nothing will cure my boredom.

I know some of you guys will tell me that I'm depressed, and that I should go to therapy/counseling (which I do), and I have no problem with that. But just know that I really mean what I say that I'm bored of just about nearly everything.

Every time I got outside for walks, I contemplate on how to get myself out of this painfully and seemingly endless loop of boredom. But it would seem like that going outside just to clear my mind and drawing and writing are the only options for me, for now at least.

I know all of what I'm saying is making me sound like I'm exaggerating, but I truly am bored. And I really want someone to talk to, but I don't want to be a burden to no one, so I might as well be a man and face my issues on my own. After all, I'm left with only by myself at the end of the day. I'm sorry for ranting, this is the end of it.",depression
"How can I help my depressed bf? I (19F) started a new relationship and I really like this guy (18M). He’s super sweet and adorable. He struggles with depression and anxiety, he’s on meds and therapy which I think helps him. But recently he’s been very tired and sad. Which I think is his depression. Honestly (please don’t hate on me for this) I am really inexperienced with depression- I luckily have always felt relatively well. I really want to help him though but I just don’t know what to do. I want to empathize but I’m not sure how and I don’t want it to come across as fake. He doesn’t take it out on me but hes isolating himself. I’ve been giving him space because I’m not sure what to do, but Im not sure if he says one thing but really needs another. I want to encourage him to tell him he’s doing amazing everyday, I want to hug him, I want to be around him and there for him but I don’t want to be clingy or annoying. I’m scared I’ll push him further away.
But I’m also scared to give to much because it’s the beginning of our relationship and what if I give myself away and he breaks my heart….

"I need suggestions Hey all

I’m really struggling at the moment and would really appriecate some suggestions to help pull myself out 

I’ve struggled with depression my whole life. Sometimes situational, sometimes not. I’ve been in bad relationships, been the bad guy and been the victim. I’ve suffered some major losses the past 3 years and I am in therapy working through grief and trauma, in amongst other things.

I dropped out of my tertiary studies because the industry was awful and frankly not for me. Took a year off to ‘figure out’ what I wanted to do and spent around 3 of those months with a retail job.

Currently, I’m studying and jobless. I still live at home so money isn’t an issue. The study is completely online, and there’s no connection. Not even online lectures or zoom calls. Initially I didn’t think this would mess with me as I finished high school the first year of Covid. But right now I am just feeling so incredibly isolated. I’ve developed quite severe health anxiety which I never experienced when my life was more ‘normal’.

I have 1 close friend who’s amazing, but other than that I just have a few mates who I don’t share that same deep connection with. I barely ever leave the house as I have no real reason to. I’ve lost all motivation to study, I’ve started isolating again. I fall asleep between 3:30 - 6:00 AM most days and try my absolute best to get up before 1 PM. Most days I’ll only eat dinner and some days that’s all. Other days I’ll binge on crap (entire bags of snacks). I pretty much constantly have a headache and it’s pretty obvious why. I have no routine and feel like there’s no real reason to develop one.

I’m just starting to feel like I’m suffocating. I want so badly to have a good life, I have an idea of the job I’d like to have once my study is over. I know I want a healthy relationship, my own place in the city and to own my own animals someday. I’m just so terrified that I will never get there and will feel this way forever.

Other than therapy (that I’m already in), the only other thing I’ve thought of is to set aside an hour a day to colour in with no phone allowed.

Other than that I feel completely lost and helpless, and would appreciate any suggestions.",depression

Voy a hacer en nada 2 años con depresión diagnosticada y medicada, aun q creo q todo empezó antes de que me la diagnosticaran, y que este fue un diagnóstico tardío.
La verdad es q no se por donde empezar. Últimamente me siento como una mierda. Vivo con mi pareja actualmente, llevamos dos meses viviendo juntos, pero la verdad es q ya siento q ni con el estoy bien, no hay día en el q no piense en quitarme la vida y la verdad es q cada vez pasa con más frecuencia q antes. Y cada vez se me hace más difícil no hacerlo.
Sinceramente ya no sé qué hacer. No sé si quiero q me ayuden a salir o quiero acabar con todo y rendirme, no sé q es lo que quiero.

Siento que soy una cobarde y que debería haber acabado con todo hace mucho tiempo, pero luego cuando voy a hacerlo pienso en lo q esto puede conllevar, y me preocupo por la gente q me rodea, q aunq no me ayuden o me hagan daño, sigo siendo tan imbécil que me siguen importando.

Por favor solo quiero q alguien me entienda y se preocupe por mi. Solo quiero sentir q de verdad le importo a alguien en lo más mínimo, lo suficiente para poder seguir adelante.

"Self realization I've gotten to the point where I don't really feel lonely or like nobody cares but I just realized how much of a toxic misanthrope I actually am.

I feel like I just hurt those around me. I only feel normal when I'm alone with my thoughts or drunk.

I used to dream of having someone super close to be intimate and open with, mostly a girlfriend. But the reality is anybody who'd be there for me would just end up burned in the end. It's weird because I still constantly think about being held and pitied and showed unconditional affection even for a moment.

Beyond that I just don't feel motivated to do anything. It all feels like a distraction. Even when I try I end up disappointed in myself.

"Am I just pathetic? This will be long, I'm hoping context might help. I don't know what I want from posting this really.

32F suffered with depression, low self esteem and suicidal thoughts since I was 13 years old.

14 months ago, my Dad had a near fatal heart attack. 
Two weeks later, my partner of over 12 years ended our relationship. 
About 2 months after that, I started a new job; I thought a fresh start might be a good distraction. 
I moved back in with my parents in March The house I owned with my ex finally sold in August (we had some buyer issues which prolonged the sale process).
I left the new job just over a month ago because I wasn't happy there and I thought leaving might kick me into gear to figuring out what to do next.
Throughout all of this, contact with the ex was amicable which made logistically separating easy to navigate. But eventually I decided still having contact with them was too hard now we had no reason to talk. So a week after I handed in my notice, we arranged to meet to check there was nothing else to sort out before agreeing to no further contact. They told me during this meetup that they'd been lying and keeping secrets the whole time we were together- I have felt insane since finding this out, I can't stop obsessing over everything. I feel like an idiot- the relationship ended a year ago- shouldn't I be over it all by now?! 

Despite the last year, I am incredibly fortunate; I have a safe place to live, supportive family, a couple of friends, financial stability. 
But the depression and suicidal thoughts are the worst they've ever been. Since I left my job, I barely leave the house. I don't know what to do, I don't know what I like. I feel like I have nothing to offer anybody and I'm just draining everyone around me.
I have a couple of friends but they have their own lives and relationships so I don't want to burden them, and when I see them I don't feel like I should talk about how I'm really feeling because I have so much to be grateful for, I'm just pathetic for being like this.

It's a waste of our money and we finally want you to be out of the house so we can have our peace""....and more.

"Rotting away at 16 All I do is lay in bed and rot. I truly do nothing all day and I’ve finally fully given up. I’m far too depressed and anxious to do anything and I’m giving up.

I don’t care about getting a license anymore even though thats the only thing I looked forward to as a child, I don’t care about school, i don’t care about college, i don’t care about getting a job or leaving the house. I don’t care about my relationships anymore. I just don’t care what happens to me. 

I WANT to lay here and die and melt into my mattress that is genuinely my only desire. My desire is to let go and lay here till I disappear. 
All I do is get worse and worse and sicker and sicker. I go to therapy, I see my psychiatrist, i take the pills and the supplements and I do the exercises I do it all right and I’m still a limp shell of a human and I’m so tired of having to exist. I have no energy to be a person. 
Giving up does mean killing myself, thats too much work. Giving up means I just do nothing till Im dead. Drop me in a hospital or on the street and I don’t think Id lift my head.

It hurts but I don’t want to beg for help anymore I’m far too fucking tired.",depression
"Failing to get out of bed until I need to I can get out of bed to be on time for work. And get out of bed to be on time for a doctor's appointment if I have one before work. I work second shift so this effectively means I sleep until the afternoon until it's time to get dressed for work, unless it's a day of a doctor's appointment (to which I show up underrested)!

"I hate my job Let me start off by saying I’m grateful to have a job in the first place but I don’t know how much more I can take. I despise waking up every morning to a job I hate so much. 

I originally applied for a position in the engineering department which I really enjoyed for the few weeks I worked in it. For some reason I was told another department is short staffed so they told me I had to work in that department. I thought it was only temporary but it seems like it’s become permanent. With this position they placed me in they have me traveling all across the state and staying in places overnight that I don’t want to be staying in. And I absolutely hate it.

This job has caused my severe depression to return and Im in the worst mental health crisis I have experienced in a very long time. I don’t know how much longer I can take it before I break. I want to quit but feel stuck because of the pay and experience. But my physical and mental health is only getting worse and I don’t know what to do. I get so upset and tired everyday that I don’t even know what is normal anymore. I am just looking for some advice or someone that has been in a similar situation.",depression

"No solution but death I’m 22 and I know that’s young but hear me out, ever since I was young I had this dream life I wanted to have at least by the time I was in my early twenties. I know, sounds like the typical issue we all face but my dream life didn’t consist of ‘I have to be financially independent by this age’ or ‘I have to do this and that by this age’ it was never really about the action of doing or achieving something. It was more about what I would personally be like. I was certain my depression would have at least subsided enough to allow me to experience everything I’d missed out on in my teenage years because of said depression and other mental issues but no, it’s even worse now.

But that’s not what haunts me and drives me to suicide. What haunts me is that even if I were to get better right this second, I’m only getting older. I will never be 21 or 16 again or whatever. I will be getting older and older and I know that’s an uncontrollable part of life but it will be like I’m starting at 0 while everyone else is so far ahead. It’s not even about comparison, believe me. It’s just to put it into perspective that I’ve missed out on all those years and I will miss out on more trying to make up for it and making up for it won’t even work because see, there’s things I wanted in to experience at certain ages and now that those ages passed me and I didn’t get to experience them I will keep longing for them and even experiencing them at this age won’t make me happy because it won’t have meaning. And for that reason I don’t want to get better. I truly don’t want to because I know I won’t be happy. I just want an out so I don’t have to deal with any of it anymore.

I don’t know if any of this is coherent, I don’t know if I explained it the way I truly feel. I think it will be misunderstood but I wanted to at least try and explain it. That’s all.",depression
"I won’t live past university  Hi Reddit. I’m coming here because I feel alone in the way I’m feeling and want to see if others relate. For context, I’m F18 and got into a life altering accident in the summer, which resulted in me having permanent damage on my face and some other parts of my body (I won’t be giving additional details to protect my privacy; just know it doesn’t impact my mobility but has affected my self esteem greatly) . Obviously my response to this was to fall into a pretty terrible depression. However now, the initial shock of it all is over, but the depression has yet to subside.   
  
in light of all this pain, as well as the realisation that I will have to live forever the way I am now, feeling constant heartache and grief over my pre-accident self; all the things I took for granted and which people around me still have; as well as insane regret over having put myself into a dangerous yet completely avoidable situation which led to the accident, i have realised that I will not be able to sustain this long term, and have resorted to finding a way to end it once university ends. 

i have chosen to stick it out for 3 years, despite each day consisting in me trying to bottle up my pain to live a semi normal life, and ignoring the questioning looks of people of why I look the way I do (as I said, my face sustained some shock in the accident, which has been the hardest to deal with. damn I miss finding myself pretty everyday), because despite it all, I DID use to be a person who wanted to live. However now, I think enjoying the small pockets of joy which life has to offer for 3 more years is enough; I think I’ll be satisfied with how much of the world I’ve experienced by then (if not earlier, as in end of my second year). 

I do however, grieve the idea of life that I had before all this. there is not so much which I am sad I won’t experience, but one of them is sadness at never having a baby of my own to love. I do think motherhood could save me in some ways, by focusing on someone else rather than myself, but I don’t see how I could have a kid rn in a sustainable way, being an 18 y old uni student and all, so I’ve just had to resign myself to never having that. 

I am in therapy and am medicated for this, which maybe helps making this all feel more tolerable, but it is just not enough. I dont want to spend the rest of my life simply tolerating how I feel, I wanted to spend it the way I did before all this, fully living, with joy and heartache.  It is useless to say that I will get better; because it won’t; there is permanent physical damage in my life that wont leave no matter how much therapy I have to help me get over it. 

It is genuinely relieving to know that I only have to feel this way for 2-3 more years, and I honestly can’t wait for the day to come where I am on my last day. But, it is lonely. Why are all my friends living the happiest times of their lives, with little problems other than school stress, whilst I cope with the aftermath of a stupid accident. there are definitely things I want to try before I die; smoking grass lol, having my first time, ok idk what else but I’m sure there’s more. So I guess I’ll find joy in trying to complete these things on a count down. im also just binging shows to distract myself, but this is defo having an impact on my schoolwork (which I don’t even take serious bc what’s the point if I’ll never even enter the workforce)…

  
okay I don’t think there’s a way to end this, I just wanted to vent my feelings for a little bit and not feel so so alone. Is anyone else thinking of ending it after uni, If so do you want to share how you are mentally preparing for that? or is anyone else dealing with physical issues which has caused depression? Idk just anyone who feels they can relate to any part of this, feel free to share if u wish

I don't care anymore  I honestly don't care anymore. About anything. I don't care about anyone anymore or myself. I have not slept yet been about 1 day. Just let me sleep floor the rest of my life and never wake up. I wish I could dream and stay sleep forever. ,depression
"I can't do this but I can't not do it either I'm 17, I've been depressed my entire life. I'm turning 18 later this month and it has filled me with much dread. I can't take care of myself or do much of anything. I dropped out of school in freshman year and I never go outside. I have no friends in person, and I had no friends when I was attending school either. I am autistic, transgender, fat, and ugly. Four things that have no place in this world, no place to thrive and be happy anyway. I haven't felt real joy in a long time. It's gotten to the point where I dread feeling any moment of happiness because I know it's going to end so quickly and I'll start feeling empty again, wishing I had never felt happy in the first place because it's more painful for the joy to be taken away over and over than for it to not be there at all.   
  
I've never had a job, and I can't work because I can't bring myself to leave my house. I occasionally leave maybe once a month to go to the grocery store with my mother or to visit my sister and that's it. I live in a trailer and am underneath the poverty threshold. There is black mold everywhere in the bathroom and it's been making me sick, my eyes always sting and my face always burns. We even have rats. We can't use the oven because when you turn it on, I suppose the ammonia from the rat-piss behind it ignites and the stench is so strong you can't breathe.   
  
I've opened up about my situation to online friends in the past but it seems it always ends up as just something for them to use against me and make fun of me for in the future whenever I piss them off. I know my mother is trying but I don't think she realizes just how bad our situation is. She spends so much money on weed and alcohol that by the end of the month our water or electric is always getting cut off. It's been this way for some years now. She passively aggressively suggests I get a job constantly and she doesn't understand that I want to more than anything, but I physically can't. I can't even bring myself to shower or change my clothes most of the time.   
  
People will try to tell me that I'm not a burden but I genuinely am; I contribute nothing to this world and only leech off of others. I regret my parents for having brought me into this world, I wish so so desperately that I had never been born at all. It's painful knowing that I'm stuck here until I die. Death is terrifying for me and has brought me nothing more than existential dread since the age of 6. I don't want to die but I can't exist either, not like this. Not existing or not having been born is all I think about all day.  
  
 I can slowly feel myself entering a state of psychosis. My thoughts grow more erratic and extreme with each passing day, and will continue to do so until eventually I can't recognize them as abnormal anymore. I am slowly becoming delusional. I only fear what I will do when I finally reach this state of detachment from reality. I have a girlfriend who I've been dating online since 2020 and we were planning to meet sometime after I turn 18 (only because I am supposedly supposed to have more 'freedom' when I am an adult, but that doesn't change the fact that I cannot drive, have no money nor a job).  
  
 I love her with all my heart but I fear me loving her isn't enough for me to want to stay here, to want to live. I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried medication and therapy, but it eventually all turns out to be pointless. When I get a therapist once every couple of years, it eventually ends by me not being able to make my appointments because my mom works and I don't have a car. There's so many problems I have that I can't even begin to list here because it would make the post too lengthy, and then nobody would read it. I don't even know if anyone is reading this one. I don't know what to do anymore, I don't know what to do anymore and I fear what I'm capable of when I finally lose it, if I am capable of anything at all.",depression
"scared and confused Burner account. 

I was pretty down on life and disillusioned. Not functioning super well. So I was trying to do a social media detox to help fix my life. No phones before bed. Just silent thoughts. They were a bit suicidal, but I figured thats good. I'm getting to the bottom of my problems. But night by night, they just keep getting darker and darker.  Its like a disease that's spreading. Tonight, I had to break the ""no phones before bed"" rule because I got scared by how dark they were. And I would rather be a mindless tiktok-scrolling zombie than alone inside my own head.

I resist the label ""depressed"". I laugh and smile and am happy too often for anyone (even myself) to suspect really how bad it is. It might be a side-effect of ADHD, or CPTSD or I don't know what. Whatever it is, it just gets worse. And I'm a little scared, I don't know how bad its going to get. Its getting to the point where honestly don't know what's wrong with me, but if it continues for another few weeks I'll need help. And I hate asking for help. And paying for help. And therapists in general. Im sure there are wonderful therapists, but I havent met them. 

With each coming week, rock bottom gets a little lower. So Ill eventually get desperate enough to pay for help.

That's all, I guess.",depression
Therapy needed My depression is getting pretty bad again. I can’t bring myself to return to therapy bc I’m so mad and tired and annoyed of going to therapy. Some of you know how frustrating and time consuming therapy is. I also think my life is inherently bad and will always be bad so therapy won’t help bad circumstances out of my control. I hate my life and want to give up on improving it bc I get my hopes up for no reason. I hate almost everything about my life even though it’s not that that bad. Just shows that I’ll never be happy. I think therapy won’t make me happier either. ,depression

"Lost I feel so empty, like I’m just a husk of myself walking around pretending to be content. I’ve gotten to the point I barely feel anything and when I do it’s overwhelming.

"Partner with Depression Hi everyone, I’m really looking for some help here and I don’t really know who else to ask at this point, any and all advice welcome.

*Context* I started dating a guy last January, we started off relatively casual but have been dating exclusively and pretty seriously since the end of May. This whole time I’ve known he’s really struggled with his mental health and depression, to the point where he has gone on medication and has started weekly therapy. I was really happy that he’s taking steps to improve these things, and I support his choices completely. 

Basically at the end of September I had a chat with him that I would like to be officially boyfriend/girlfriend, to which he said he didn’t feel ready because he felt like he couldn’t put me first because he’s still feeling in such a bad place with his depression. I accepted this and frankly, it’s just words, I’m happy with what we’re doing and where we’re at. I’m not asking him to put me first at all, I want him to get better, I just want to be with him. 

*Issue*
Last night he wanted to have a chat because he was worried that we hadn’t talked about the ramifications of him not being ready for me and my feelings. He opened up to me a lot about how he’s feeling really helpless, he doesn’t feel like the drugs and therapy are helping at all and he just feels terrified and broken. He also was talking about how he was terrified of losing me and didn’t want to hurt me, but he’s scared that he’s not putting himself first enough and it’s going to end up with him hurting me, leaving me, and fucking everything up.

I really tried to comfort him, I cannot stress enough that I just want to be with him, the good, and the bad. I’m totally in love with him and I want to help him through this. But I just felt like I was saying the wrong thing, he didn’t want me to say I’m by his side and if he’ll let me I won’t be going anywhere. But I don’t know what he did want me to say. 

I asked him if he was breaking up with me and he said he wasn’t, he was having this chat to actively avoid having a break up cause he loves me as well, but he’s just terrified and doesn’t feel in control.

He repeatedly told me how terrified he is of losing me, not getting better and how bad his brain is. When I would say I just want to be there for him he kept saying I’m not understanding. 

I just really need some advice because frankly, I’m out of my depth. I just want him to believe me when I tell him I love him and I just want him, all of him, no matter what that means. Does anyone have any advice of what I can do to either prove that I mean it when I say I’m here, or what to say to help him not be so terrified. As much as it breaks my heart, do you think I need to walk away? Which is absolutely not what I want to do, but if it’s what he needs should I suggest it? Will me even saying that make him feel worse?

Please help give me any and all advice on how I can help x thank you so much for reading",depression
"Is my life over at age 22? *small TW for mentions of abuse* I graduated college last May. My school was pretty prestigious and i graduated with a degree that opens a lot of doors in the industry i want. I’ve had several internships, jobs, and my resume is stacked. The only dent is my 3.1 GPA which apparently isn’t “good enough” for some jobs I’m really qualified for. I’m not trying to go into IB or work for Apple, and I’m competent enough. I haven’t found a job. I was extremely close in August but they dropped me last minute for no reason, and it was a job i was seriously looking forward to. I’ve had sparse interviews, I’ve lost motivation, and it’s made me depressed. I feel like I’m so behind my peers. Almost all of my friends live in a city out of state, and I’m trying to move there but i think jobs won’t want to pay relocation (my hometown is not far from this city and i could cover relocation) or take a chance on a recent grad. I’ve gotten insanely depressed about this. I’ve slowed down job applications, i feel hopeless, and I’ve started eating and moving around less. Showering is hard, the thought of cooking is a nightmare, and I keep ordering kpop albums with money I don’t have just so I can have something to look forward to in the next four days. I don’t know how long I can keep this up. I’m already far away from my friends as is, and I’ve gotten depressed to a point where I won’t even travel to see them or see any friends from home. I’m 22 and I know I have a while ahead of me. I just can’t seem to see a light at the end of the tunnel. It feels more like a cave where I’m just stuck in darkness. I’ve dealt with suicide attempts, verbal and sexual abuse, and insane breakdowns that left me unable to function, but this is breaking me. I feel so numb every day. I genuinely think that if I don’t find anything by new years I should give up and end it or take a job I hate in my hometown and live miserably to a point where I’ll want to end it. I’m considering paying for job services at this point, but with what money? And my friends don’t understand. I believe I’m pretty attractive, funny, and outgoing, but I am deeply hurting and I can’t stand the thought of letting someone in. My feelings are bottled up but not exploding, I’m just constantly checked out. I really don’t know what to do and I’m so depressed it’s making me sick.

everyone keeps telling me that i need to aim for a job that pays well, regardless of how i feel working it, because at the end of the day i get to spend my money on what i want. money doesnt make me happy. i dont feel joy buying things. i want to aim for a job that will make me happy above paying me, but everytime i bring up the idea to anyone, im told to think twice about it, and then i go down a rabbithole of doubt. i also get told that work is just a way of life, and i genuinely cannot understand how anyone on this earth is able to just accept that. we have to trade away a third of our whole lives, just to scrape by for the rest?

"I’m loser a failure and a monster All my life I literally don’t feel like I have ever achieved anything of note, I’ve had girlfriends and cheated on all of them, hurt friends fucked around at school trying to be an apprentice mechanic but I don’t think I’m good at it I make so many mistakes and panic every day, I hate who I am and I have no idea how to change I have good things, and then just ruin them in every way I always end up alone and more broken every time and the only lesson I seem to learn is that I’m not a good person and don’t treat the thing I have right no matter how hard I try I never seem to be good enough for anything I care about, and eventually kill it because “it doesn’t feel right” I just wish I could feel anything other than anger or fear I give ppl this false confidence and almost arrogance because it hides how I really feel the only things I really enjoy doing now are driving and getting drunk because when I’m in my car or drunk I can believe my own lie of “I’m ok” I just want the pain to go away, start over find things that make me happy instead of things that just relax the pain for a short time. have things to look forward to instead of relief that the task is complete find someone who i actually care about and want to be around not like all the time but most of it someone who won’t hound me for being me and just accept that I’m not ok. I want to find a way to love and believe that I am loved, but all I feel right now is a complete failure and undeserving of everything I have. I hate who I am and I don’t want to die (atm it fluctuates) I just want relief from the monster in my head and the way I really feel about myself. I’d love to go to therapy but I just don’t have the money and idek if it would work at this point I’ve pretty much accepted that this is the way I am and I hate it.",depression

"Guilt I’ve struggled with what I’m guessing is depression for around four years now. I haven’t seen an expert yet but I have booked to see one later this month. Everyday I feel like my mind tells me I’m not worth the trouble and no doctor will care. I’m just a miserable dude who hurts himself and longs to leave this plane. I want to feel at peace again so badly. My head feels like it’s in a constant battle against itself and it’s so draining. It’s not like I’m going to kill someone or pose a threat to society so why should doctors care? I feel like my illness is not valid and I’m just putting all these thoughts in my head on purpose. I know something isn’t right with me but I just feel guilty for being like this when I live a pretty decent life. I don’t know if it’s the illness telling me that my struggles aren’t real or it’s just me. I hope this makes sense for some people here. 

Also I’d love to make some new friends, so feel free to talk to me about whatever. It’d be nice to communicate with people who feel the same way. ",depression
"How do I tell my mom I think I have depression? I'm 15 years old, and I've been falling into a depressive state. It's common for me to go in and out of a depression every little while. However, I have been getting worse. My mom is one of my best friends, But a best friend in the sense of ""Oh my gosh let's go shopping!"" or ""Isn't that boy so cute?"" I am so scared to talk to her about feeling this way. But last night I tried to overdose on ibuprofen. (I weigh 130lbs, and I took 21 400mg Advil's.) And then again this morning by taking 4x my normal Vyvanse prescription.  (200mg) I honestly just want to sleep forever but not die. I just need a break. From school, sports, friends, and everything else. Please help me. I need to know how I should bring this up with my mom. ",depression

"Feeling depressed and hopeless It has being a week his mom has being picking up arguments with me and starts criticizing me as a person in a negative way. So it was a week ago me and his mom went to store to buy some stuff for Halloween she brought up I am bringing problems to the house and I should go back to my parents place because I am their problem. I go out of my way to help her just to say this to my face. She says I should stand on my feet and feet to confront my partner about me going to work and says I like to blow money plus saying I am a daily/selfish. Last night, she told a lie to my partner saying she was going to help me and agree with my partner about our plans. Right before my partner dad came home from work and my partner had the conversation about her helping me she says I don't want to her because she spend all her money and starts saying I'm the problem since I pay my bills and necessities. On the things she say it bring me memories when I was young. People would say I am a failure and a loss cause. I told my partner how I feel and he takes her side see her point. She make me look as a bad person and it emotionally draining me. This is pushing me to the edge. Idk her intentions to get us split up",depression
"[Vent] My mom makes me feel sorry for being born and living. She frequently talks about how much she had to sacrifice to raise me, which makes me feel like I bring nothing into her life and the main reason she'd like me to not kms is because of the 18 years of her life she spent on me and not as much because I'm her son. Sometimes I can't put up with her guilt tripping me and thoughts like: ""Would her life be better had it not been for my existence?"" become pretty loud in my head. She also sometimes gets drunk and in that state she loses any self-restriction and is more likely to say hurtful things, not just to me, often resulting in arguments with my father. There's more I'd like to say, more about myself, but it would be straying too hard from the main subject, so yeah... Good night or have a great day, depending where you live.",depression

"Side effects of Risperidone, better alternative?
 **My Current Medications and Sleep Struggles**

I’m currently taking the following medications:

* **Kredex (Carvedilol) 6.25 mg, twice a day**: A beta-blocker for heart-related issues.
* **Sipralexa (Escitalopram) 10 mg, once a day**: This is for managing **anxiety and depression**.
* **Risperdal (Risperidone) 1 mg, almost every eveing**: I’ve been using it primarily to help with sleep.
* **Lysanxia (Prazepam) 10 mg, as needed for anxiety**: A benzodiazepine I use for anxiety relief.

Personalia:

* 26 years old
* 1m76
* 70 kg
* male

I’ve noticed that I’m **really fatigued in the mornings**, and I believe this is due to **Risperidone**, which helps me sleep but leaves me feeling groggy and exhausted when I wake up. I also used to take **Zopiclone** for sleep, but my doctor stopped it because it was **addictive**.

Additionally, I **never feel full of energy** during the day, which is frustrating. I’m looking for a **non-addictive alternative** to help with my sleep problems. My main issues are **falling asleep**, **staying asleep through the night**, and **falling back asleep** if I wake up.

"How can I help my boyfriend who resents life?  Hi everyone, sorry for bad spelling English is not my first language. So my (24M) boyfriend (26M) has always struggled with depression. We think he is on the autism spectrum but can’t afford a specialist to diagnose + our country has not very much supports. I’m still in college and working part time and he works casually (still about 30 hrs/week). We moved in together 2 years ago, and since then he’s seemed to be finding working more and more difficult. On days he has work he’s extremely grumpy and says that he can’t cope/wants to unalive himself at the thought of working. This has always been something he jokes about but in the last year he’s gone through some relationship trauma with his family and friends and now says that he doesn’t see himself ever being happy or satisfied living life in our society. He says life is not worth it. On days he does not work he is happy most of the time, but says that he wishes all he has to do is stay home and do his craft. We are both people who don’t like going out so this is fine, but then he gets stuck in his head saying money and a million dolars will solve all his problems. He even gets grumpy at me and argues when I say everything will be ok and he is too stressed, he just says life is too stressful for him. I don’t want to take it personally because I know he is suffering, but this makes me feel like our future plans and dreams isn’t worth working for. I’ve been carrying most of the household chores and supporting him as best as I can, but it never seems like enough. I know I can’t make him be happy, but sometimes it makes me sad that he is not excited for life like I am. How can I marry or have children with him if this is his views? We have talked about therapy and medication, but both are too expensive or doesn’t work. He also has no safety net or family that can support him. 
What are some steps I should consider? How can I help him?",depression

It just makes me feel broken in some indescribable way that makes it so hard to be happy.  Does anyone else feel this way? Did anything help?",depression
"homesick and depressed TW: drugs, depression, suicide, suicidal thoughts, death, substance abuse, alcohol, etc.

hello,

my depression fades in and out, a lot of days I can be really depressed, cold (physically), sweating or anxious. Then the next day my body acts like none of that happened. I wake up feeling really cold, but I sweat. The cold sweat every night, not being able to sleep, not being able to stop overthinking, it takes a real toll on me.

I've attempted suicide before. I will say that's not how I currently feel. Though, if I were to die, I wouldn't feel any type of way about it. I would want to accept it, because at this point it's more of a solution than an issue in my life. I'm behind on work, behind on rent, behind on other bills such as water and electricity.

On top of that I got suspended from work for a month and a half for some bullshit, like missing a single deadline for a document that wasn't even important. I did everything else right, every meeting, every document, project, but no this world wants to focus on the worst always.

I've been cheated on by every girl I dated, 5 girls out of 5. That's why I stopped dating and went to therapy, and I asked my therapist to help me build a healthier relationship with myself and others. He tried to help, but even he said I seem like a good person and that them cheating was their fault and not mine. But how can I even believe that when I'm the one being cheated on every time? and no i wont cheat back or anything because I have morals.

So I tried to have ""single fun"", online, irl, and i was successful. It was actually easier than I thought it would be, but maybe it was a fluke because after a fling, i had nothing. To be fair, I stayed inside my apartment alone, smoking weed or cigarettes until i would pass out or numb myself. I missed home everyday (living with my parents), I'm only 21. Life isn't supposed to kick me so hard from every direction all of my life. I see others who struggle less than me, and I don't really envy them until they judge me.

For example, I had one of my childhood friends visit me at my place. He saw it was messy and that I was ashamed, but he tried to joke about it being dirty and stuff. He asked me why I just smoked weed all day and nothing else, and I told him how depressed I was. I don't think he understood, because he tried to offer me other solutions like go to the gym. My problem wasnt gym related, I have a very well maintained, athletic figure, I'm fit with good stamina and I stay relatively active despite not going to the gym.

whenever people try to offer ""help"" why is it always advice and not something more concrete? for example, if my friends told me they were depressed, I'd ask them how I could help, instead of assuming their problem was gym.

Well anyway, I'm with my parents right now which is why I'm not suicidal I guess. I felt very good when I was here, safe and comfortable. But now I have to go back to my place (2 hours via flight or 8 hours via land), and I won't see my family for at least a few more weeks.

I know my problems may sound small to some, but to me nothing feels more important right now than staying here in my hometown with my family. I hate that I have to go back to such a stranded place where I'm lucky to see a person on the street.

Honestly, I've quit alcohol. I didnt touch it at all this year and that was big progress, because I was an alcoholic. I also tried to quit thc and I made some progress (2 months) but i relapsed. it feels like such an unnecessary battle now, why am i even fighting it? I should just give in and keep smoking or something until I get to go back home",depression
"I want to give up I'm only 27 and I just want to die. Haven't gone through with it yet because it would destroy my sister and grandmother. Cut out my ""friends"" because I got tired of being a fucking pushover and a people-pleaser. It's amazing how despite the constant emotional abuse, I'm the bad guy for not putting up with it. It makes my blood fucking boil. These garbage people are no longer in my life, but I can't let go of the hate and resentment. I know that I should, but its so hard.

I've tried bringing up my suicidal thoughts to my parents, but they are too emotionally immature to offer any sort of help or advice. Mom has threatened to institutionalize me in the past, and dad never really has much to say at all. They had me and my sister late, so they're older and naturally have that boomer mentality that their way is the only way and if you dont do exactly what they feel is best, something is wrong with you. I had to figure out a lot on my own and still struggle to figure out shit now, but I'm the asshole for telling them that. What a load of bullshit.

Can't afford therapy at the moment. Starting a new job soon so maybe that will change, but I'm so mentally exhausted and checked-out at this point. Hell, I even joined a gym a few months back because i wanted to feel just a bit better. To feel something at least, but I don't really know what I'm doing so naturally, that fell through.

I don't really see the point anymore. Hobbies don't hit the same. The loneliness fucking kills me and I don't know how to make new friends because of my shit social skills. I just want to eat a fucking bullet. ",depression

"I need help and Im only 15. (TW) 
I have been struggling with what i believe to be depression since i was atleast 10 years old. 

However, before i begin i would like to mention this is a really sensitive topic and situation for me to be talking about. So i would appreciate it if nobody tells me that “you cant have depression at 10 years old!!” or anything along those lines. 

I have always been so scared to talk to my parents about this because, even though both of my older siblings have struggled with similar issues, I just feel scared bringing this up with them. 
I must clarify though, that maybe i dont have depression but i do know that something is genuinely wrong with me and it runs along the lines of depression. 

2 nights ago, i attempted to overdose by taking 21 400mg ibuprofens. Obviously, this did nothing to me, And Ive never been one to act like this, But i just needed a big break from everything in life, Literally the noise, distractions, stress, and just overall pain. I need it all to stop.
The following morning, I just felt extremely nauseous. I cant even describe the pain i was feeling, it was almost comforting. 

Though, I suppose in the morning I just wasn’t completely awake when i made this decision, but i took 100mg of Vyvanse (An ADHD medication) and throughout the day i secretly took a little more, and more. 

I genuinely just think that I wanted an end not only to the pain, But to having no one ever take me seriously. I try to nonchalantly drop hints of me struggling to friends, teammates, teachers, etc. And everyone thinks im joking or just being dramatic.

If im being so honest. The majority of the time, Its not even that i necessarily want to die. I just need a break from the constant pain. I truly believe that I need actual help. - I dont know what to do. 

Please help me im so desperate and im struggling.",depression
"My therapist haven't brought up any question surrounding sadness I've been meeting my therapist for a few weeks now, maybe total two months. We have spoken a lot especially about social anxiety and my problems with focus. But one thing she has never brought up is if I'm actually doing okay... You know, she's never asked me about feeling sad or anything like that which in my opinion seems like quite an important thing. I have spoken about certain times where I don't remember anything from or me feeling very low but she has never forwarded anything on that. Idk, maybe I need to become better bringing it up but still. I feel heavily depressed all the time and she's never even brought up if my focus problems could be due to that... Also it's a difficult thing bringing up on your own because it's sometimes hard to explain but idk. I'll probably need to switch either way but still idk.

"crippling existential dread Often when I'm sitting at home I am paralyzed from doing anything as I am consumed by a feeling of existential dread. I feel invisible, lethargic, lonely, anxious, sad, and worthless.

I haven't had a human connection in years. I can't remember the last time someone texted or called me that I knew. I only communicate with people I work with, at work, that's it.

All that to say this feeling of dread is maybe me feeling that my life is very stressful and will just get worse. Sometimes I just need to sleep for 16+ hours to stop feeling like this. But even then eventually it comes back because nothing changes, my life just gets a little worse day by day.",depression
"Why can't I just buckle down and live life like a normal person?  I feel like this every day.

I feel overwhelmed so much and by nearly everything. I hate leaving the house. I eat my feelings. I feel utterly worthless in life. 

I started feeling better in March. I was finishing up some personal counseling. We got a puppy and I felt purpose again (which sounds terrible because I have a 17 year old at home). I had something that needed me. I woke up early to let him out and play. I attended training classes with him. Brought him everywhere to socialize. 

I started to feel better. Took vacations with my partner and son. Had family outings. I started taking better care of the house, started eating better, cooking and took on more chores. I planned to go back to school. I was so excited to get back to reality. 

And then our puppy was diagnosed with cancer and passed away within a week. He wasn't even 9 months old. 

I immediately went back to my depressive state and haven't been able to dig myself out of this hole.

Part of it is because I’ve been trying to count calories and lose weight lately and it’s a pain. My favorite thing is - well, was eating but now it feels restricted and all I can think about is eating something. I try to fill the void with water but in the end I always want more. Every serving size isn’t filling enough and it’s as if it’s for a toddler. 

Additionally, I have no goals or aspirations that I want to pursue. I want a quick way out but that isn’t feasible right now.

I can do anything except for be honest, and cry. I don't cry, almost ever. And nobody around me sees me as worth anything. I'm just there, quiet, and on the side. I can't think of a single emotion that I haven't had to suppress. I'm like a walking lie, a smile, a laugh, a living body, an unharmed body.

My girlfriend is needy and pushy and childish, and I can't tell her that, because otherwise she'll get mad at me. My best friend gave up on me and didn't even tell me when his fucking grandmother died, when he told everyone else. My friends all demand so much out of me and can't be bothered to care when I have nothing left to give. I am a worthless, useless, horrible person who can't even be genuine. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't want to cut my legs open or slit my throat. I can't do that, because I have too much work. I am angry with the world for screwing my friends over, while I sit here with my mind beating me into the ground. It got so bad that I completely shut myself off and have lied to everyone day in and day out. It's hilarious. No matter what I do, I screw up. No matter what I do, I'm in the wrong. I'm the bad guy. Everything I do is a mistake. I can't get anything right, and I have no power to help. My brothers have turned my mental health into a joke, and my parents get angry at me if I even look unhappy.

"I have depression from my ability to get laid and have developed sexual shame Just to be clear im not asking for dating advice here. If you are allowed to under the rules of the subreddit you can contact me directly about that. I am here to ask about mental stuff. I hate being in the position I am. I feel like my youth has been wasted from not having sex at all. I am M21, only had sex a couple times with one person and It didn’t work out. Ive built this stigma that a large amount of people my age have a good amount of sex. Not anything crazy for the average person but I think the average could get laid maybe by like one to three different girls each school semester or something. I just feel like thats a large amount of people that get a good amount of sex and im missing out on it. But ill try not to get too off track but this shit is really eating away at me mentally. I feel like every day life isn’t valuable if I didn’t have sex recently. Also another factor is that, and when I say this im not trying to be egotistical, I am a pretty attractive man with a good haircut and frame at 6’4 and I think that causes an imbalance with my brain when im not able to attract a woman. I just can’t keep living like this, I need a relatively good amount sex for one thing (not trying to be a p¡g) and I need to get over these mental problems

"Feeling depressed  Me F(25) feeling depressed and constantly self harming because my parents are trying to marry me. I haven't achieved anything till now and for past three years I'm in my room because they are conservative, don't let me go out, I've no friends, no one to talk about.
I don't want to end up in another room for the rest of my life. 
Till now I've only seen my college and my house that's all.
I want to end all this.

"Everything feels pointless I've been depressed since I was 13, I'm now 22 years old and still have to finish high school. My mother hates me and calls me a worthless bastard and my father doesn't even care about contacting me every once in a while. 
I don't want to go out anymore and don't know how to get over it, I'm just so fucking done with this life.",depression
"I began to hate everything amd everyone I've had issues since childhood, bullying molestation, random syndromes and illnesses, so Ive always had a somewhat fucked up life I suppose, top that off with apparently being a magnet for actually clinically diagnosed sociopaths that ruined my emotional wellbeing, both in a romantic and platonic sense, odd it happened twice now. I spent most of my feeling holding onto the hope that when I'm an adult Ill become someone Im proud of and show everyone what im worth, yet now I cant achieve anything I want, cant make friends, cant bring the courage to date again, so Im simply lost. 

I hate my job so much that I want to kill myself just to escape the thought of it but I don't because of my family, but im trapped here in corporate hell, in a country where I dont speak the language of very well, and I feel empty, lost, lonely, i don't even have anyone to say this to anymore, misunderstood, because of it every moment of every day. All the dreams I ever had became unachievable the moment I became an adult and realised just how rigged the world s and no matter how hard I try i will never amount to anything, so all i try to have now is a cozy life away from corporate stress but even that feels unachievable. I want to simply die, disappear, the amount of unease i feel everyday is indescribable. ",depression
"I‘m so over acting like I‘m okay.  I’m just over everything right now. I’m 25, turning 26 in a few months, and I feel like I’ve failed. I’m stuck in a job I hate, and after spending two years trying to break into the entertainment industry, I feel like I’ve just wasted time. I’ve lost all motivation to take care of myself. Even basic tasks—getting groceries, cleaning my apartment—feel overwhelming. What’s scary is that only six months ago, I was a happy, upbeat person, but that spark feels completely gone.

On top of that, I’m the only single person in my friend group, which leaves me feeling alone. Trying to date just adds to the frustration; it’s the same story every time—no one wants to commit. It makes me wonder, what’s the point of all this? I’ve been having dark thoughts lately, questioning if I’m even cut out for life the way others seem to be.

I know this is a bit of a ramble, but I needed to get it off my chest. Feel free to comment, or not. ",depression
"obsession at some point in a relationship i get to the point where i think i would do anything for them. Im not sure if thats good or bad. I want to talk about someone i first loved i genuinely loved them with my life, i would have taken mine away if it would have made them happy. they hurt me so bad i genuinely wanted to kms everyday but i didn’t because i knew i was the only person who cared about them. they hurt me so so much and ended up leaving my life entirely, that was 2 years ago? at first we broke up for a year, got back together because i never left them alone, i couldn’t or the connection would have ended. so they liked me again, it ended worse the second time but it was like my best relationship it had everything i wanted, i see that with the second time i fell in love, its over now, it ended awfully and everyday i go to school they try to torment me, but anyway my first one ended a long long time ago, why do I still think about them? i mean genuinely they are a shit person. but I always think about it a bit, i miss it? or maybe i just want a healthy relationship that doesn’t involve them wanting someone else or cheating and stuff, i feel like it all ends like that and it sucks. i imagine us talking again and liking eachother again, but i know that will never happen, ive tried to talk to them through someone else and they don’t want to- but maybe im thinking about them more to forget about the recent stuff im not sure but im trying to be better ",depression
I need to focus on the good things  And I know there is good just I feel overwhelmed I really feel worthless and useless . I'm old or older . I'm mad . Life doesn't seem like it use to. But I'm permanently scared from what I'm not sure. I still feel like something is different in my body even if Drs say things are basically normal. I feel lonely even if I have support. I am failing at absolutely everything it seems. Life is too hard and I can't take it anymore. I look forward to the end because life just isnt how it use to be and whatever took over is a permanent scar. The bright side is maybe 30 years more I can do this . ,depression
"I dont belong here... I dont really belong anywhere, really. I ended up with attatchments, which have kept me here this long: wife, kids, grandson. But I dont deserve them, and they deserve better than me. I cant change the world, or even myself. I get good moods, but eventually always end up with the gun. I'm too hard on myself, thanx to overbearing rapist step daddy, and I am never satisfied with my output on the job. It can always be better, and since there's room for improvement: I did'nt do the job right. I make friends easily because I always look for the good in people. But I end up forgetting they all have bad as well. And usually more bad. The world does'nt know right from wrong anymore, and it confuses me. The world cares about appearance, but not substance. September is Suicide Awareness Month... Great. How many fucking lives did that save? How many people started going out of thier way to notice others? None. The world walks by whats wrong with blinders on. And the only was to assimilate is to become like them. And so I have. I needed to become the good man that does nothing to oppose bad men. And that makes me one. 

I might try doubling all my meds first. Maybe that'll numb me enough. But if not: I'm either going with the rope or helium bag. Depends on how I want to be found I guess. Not that I care overmuch. But it would be nice if my grandson does'nt find the body. But he'll have to harden up to reality at some point. 

 I'm not giving shit away. These vultures can fight over my kingdom of shit. I'm not leaving a note: if ya paid attention you would've seen it coming. I'm not asking friends for help because I'm not even sure if they really are friends and that's too risky. If I had'nt just gotten fired on my birthday (Turns out you need to be a racist if you work for racists. That's the one thing I do right: all races should have the right to suffer equally...) I would'nt share because that's how you lose a job. I wont be calling 988 because they might just call the cops and I do not wish to be shot to death: it's not guaranteed enough. I'm not even asking for help here: Y'all dont know me. I'm just another NPC you have no reason to care about. It's fine. I just wanted to say this without being interupted. Sorry if this fucks with anyones day, but remember: you dont know me. Aint no blood from your vein.

  But everyone else should tough it out like I've been told my whole life. Maybe you'll get through it. Maybe you'll earn your good death too.",depression
"I feel trapped in my head  I’ve hit an absolute low. I’ve had depressive episodes but this time it’s horrible. In the past despite being down and unmotivated I was able to do enough just to get by but now i struggle to eat a meal (I only manage to eat something despite not having an appetite because of my medication), get out of bed, shower and go to class and work.

I have no one to turn to as my family has their own issues, my friends think I’m strong enough to deal with negative thoughts and the one therapist I felt comfortable talking to moved back to his hometown. For the first time I thought someone liked me and I had a relationship going on but I’ve been left on read for the past two weeks. What did I do to deserve a life like this. If this episode is like this I don’t know how I’ll cope with the next one.

"24 and Feel Trapped The weight of the many negative experiences I've had over the last few years is starting to get to me and I'm going to use this post to piece things together for myself. 

I started undergrad at a great school. I was really excited about it. It was fairly close to home, and I'd heard that they do a great job preparing students for the working world after you graduate. I was grateful for the opportunity. I struggled to get accustomed to the environment. My grades during the first semester weren't great, but I didn't want to give up. By spring of 2020, I felt so much more comfortable about my experience. I was even excited to study abroad. 

Then the pandemic happened. 

I was forced to go home, and all of the coping mechanisms I had couldn't be used anymore. I slept for weeks; my math teacher started to ask where I was. I couldn't comprehend what it meant to keep going even though the world was on fire. Eventually I faked my way through the rest of the semester. I fell out with my mom, the only person I was living with at the time, and I moved in with my grandparents. 

Fast forward a few years and I graduated. I moved to a new city for work. I'm a part of a program, but they haven't held up there end of the bargain of providing me with a full time role. I live in fear every day of losing my job, and my mom and others around think I was stupid for taking it. I'm exhausted. I try to fight it, but I'm haunted by the decisions I've made. I'm worried that I'll deteriorate before I find out what comes next. I don't know what to do. ",depression

* gas in the car, hair cut, or even groceries (I feel very sad if I have to spend 20 bucks on these things )

"i cant forget the day i… i cant forget the day i had to clean my friend’s cuts that were recently done some minutes before. 
it was september 16, i was in physics class and received a text from my friend who had went to the bathroom earlier. He was delaying a little but i didn’t care that much cause we were teenagers who usually went to the bathroom to smoke or just to use our phones. 
The text clearly said “m/n can u please come to the bathroom?” which i responded that i would be there in a heartbeat and if was something wrong with him. He didn’t answer. 
I asked my teacher to go to the bathroom cause my friend wasn’t feeling very well, so the teacher told me to go and please tell him how was my friend doing. 
When i entered the bathroom i didn’t saw my friend, but i could hear someone crying so i screamed the name of my friend. The last door of the bathroom slightly opened while my friend came out of it. He was crying, his makeup was ruined and his arm was full of blood and paper towels which he had used to stop the bleeding. I was petrified. 
I told him to give me the thing that he used to cut his arms while i started crying cause i was in shock. By this time i was 12 and i haven’t seen that much blood before and i didn’t know how to act. 
I remember my mom saying to me that if a wound won’t stop bleeding i just need to add some pressure for a few minutes and then call an adult. 
When i controlled the bleeding, i went back to class, still with my red eyes and trying to concentrate again in my buisiness. 

As i couldn’t do that, i waited for the break which i used to go to my fav teacher and the one who i was having teacher attachment atm and told her everything. BIG MISTAKE

"It's all too much. Surrounded by pain. Surrounded by suffering. Surrounded by loneliness. Surrounded by hopelessnes. Surrounded by poverty. Surrounded by illness. Almost every facet of life deteriorates into bullshit. And the only reprieve is death. Agonizing, unimaginable pain, and then... Nothing.

I don't want to die, but having even a basic level of contentment seems to be a trillion miles away, and there exists no vehicles to assist in the journey and my legs are already at their limit and ache badly. Contentment or day I say ""happiness"" just seems like a fairy tale.

I just wish this pain would stop. I want to be able to laugh. I want to be able to sing and joke and dance, and hug and cuddle and love and kiss and fuck all without worry. I want to be able to watch the sunset again before being presented with a big beatiful star filled sky and actually being able to feel the joy it creates and I wish my fellow suffering brothers and sisters could partake as well.

But all this doesn't exist for many of us; it is but a total, bullshit fantasy pedeled upon us by those who don't truly have our best interests at heart. And even beyond that, the universe does not exist to pander to our needs. Without thousands of years of intense work adapting ourselves to the whims of the universe, we have no choice but to suffer. And we have found ourselves only partway through that process, if there is indeed an end at all. To make a heaven out of hell... Well... it seems unfathomable.

""Please. Make it all stop. It hurts so much. No more. Oh god no more!!!"" I cry with all my might. But there exist no heroes... And I can only hope that one day I can see the brilliant light of day at the end of this relentless and cruel tunnel of darkness. I lie to myself that maybe oneday, I will be able to escape. But that is all it is: a lie. Regardless I must stay alive and beg the universe to show me mercy, lest I end up succumbing to the urge of departing from my weak and frail meat prison.

Not sure if I even have a point here. This was just all pure emotion transformed into words.",depression

"CFS/ME is the most difficult disease on this planet, it destroyed my life CFS/ME is the most difficult disease on this planet, it destroyed my life

For three years I have been struggling with CFS/ME which I got after a covid infection. By the way, I am a medical doctor, 29 years old, male. I can say with certainty that this is the most serious disease that exists on planet Earth. If this disease were deadly, then it would not be the worst disease. Precisely because it is not fatal and because the patient suffers terrible symptoms, precisely because it is the most difficult disease.

At the beginning of the disease I was mild, I could work, train, go out, but I was constantly tired and had mild PEM after exertion. As time went on that fatigue and PEM got worse and worse, so I'm currently in bed 90% of the time.
I am not able to work, socialize, I have a girlfriend, because of this disease I also lost my erection. 

Because of this disease, I lost my job, my girlfriend, my friends, my life. I am planning to kill myself, but the eternal separation from my mother makes me very sad. I am very attached to my mother and I love her very much.

The fact that if I kill myself, I will never see my mother again scares me a lot.

TLDR: I have CFS/ME, 90% bedbound, I want to kill myself but it scares me and makes me extremely sad to be forever separated from my mother.",depression

"pls can someone lmk if im depressed or anxiety or this is all just in my head hi, i'm 19yo female in second year of college. early last summer my blood test results showed me that my thyroid levels are unusually high. around early October i started feeling terrible and my feelings significantly worsened after mid October. i have tried reaching an endocrinologist since but none are available till 2025.

i am going to list my symptoms below. not expecting anything close to a doctors response but i would appreciate it if someone could read thru them and lmk if it's just related to thyroid or im depressed separately. it's driving me crazy

\- constant feeling of dread and that life is not going to get better and im just stuck in an endless space (im going to greece next semester i should feel great but instead i just feel numb and blank and terrible)

\- randomly crying for no reason . Lol once in class i inexplicably started feeling awful and cried a little it was so emb. other times when im alone ill start heaving and having a whole crying session that lasts ages

\- feeling alone / that i have no real friends / no one to confide to

\- heavy heart

\- sometimes ill wake up feeling fine . this is gonna sound weird but those mornings ill miss how i felt depressed and want to go back to it because I've become so used to it

\- feeling useless and undeserving of my quality of life

\- feeling unlovable

\- i can get distracted from all this when i hang out w people but as soon as im alone again it comes back. like a pit in my chest

\- feeling lazy and tired

\- harder for me to concentrate on work and lock in

\- hyperfixated on what i eat and eating ""healthy""

\- attaching all my self worth to my physical appearance, especially my body (but face too)

BUT... i have never ever thought of ending my life. in fact i have always been afraid of death and that has not changed and i don't think it ever will.

All of the above is for NO REASON btw. nothing is wrong in my life, i take easy af classes, there's literally no reason i should be feeling any of this but i just do. which is more frustrating bc in some ways itd be easier if i could just trace this back to a reason

"Depression is killing me and I’m making plans Ive been depressed my whole life. Ive thought about suicide for 20 years. I started giving away my stuff. I sold my car today. I’m boxing up my house. I’m making it easy. I’ve donated so many things. I’ve shared with two friends how bad it’s gotten and that I think of suicide every single day. They say to reach out, and that was me reaching out. I don’t know how or what I’d say again. People just can’t talk about things to help. I’ve been to therapy, groups, I’m medicated, I’ve been to the hospital. I am a kind and selfless person but I can’t be a good person if I hate myself. I know some of you will even call me selfish for wanting the pain to be over. I know it’ll hurt some people but I’m making it as easy as I can for others and shouldn’t there be a level of acknowledging I wouldn’t be suffering anymore? I feel like a failure and I know I’m not. I know I think differently than others, I know I’m not normal. I have my journal from 3rd grade with an entry saying I’m not like everyone else. Ive been sad forever. I hate living for other people and I’ve tried so hard to want to live for myself. I’m such an asshole for feeling this way and maybe putting people through pain. I know I lack the courage and fail at that too. I want to die so badly and I know I just need to be patient and eventually I will.

"I dont know how to deal with life I dont value having to work for things. I want to live in a world where- if I want something- I just instantly get it. No work, no struggle, no asking, no money, no developing skills, no earning it; I want to just get.

I cant eat the things I like because they make me fat. I dont want to eat healthy because theyre not the things I like. I cant spend my time how I like or I dont get enough exercise. I dont want to exercise because its hot and sweaty and requires effort. I cant simply starve myself or eat less because even being hungry is uncomfortable. Why cant I just...exist, and then be fine.

Everything I think, say, do, and feel effects other people; and vice versa. I cannot just be perfectly myself or other people either feel hurt or derride me. I share these feelings with friends and family, Im told its unrealistic or that I need to get over myseld. No comfort no sympathy. But if I object to something someone else says, they don't just agree once they realize I was right, it has to be an argument. Even the argument doesnt make them accept they were wrong. Goodness forbid its me whos wrong, then I get to either lie and feel like shit or admit it and lose standing and feel like shit. I like the trope idea of an unfeeling robot, theyd make a better friend and conversationist I think; at least when Im right.

I have to get up and work. I dont get to just eat, or socialize, or have a roof or power- even with all the bullshit stipulations above. No, I have to be useful. I have to contribute. If society does not actively materially benefit off my existence then I get to rot in the street? But do I get some kind of compensation other than the money to keep being sad? Some respect, celebration, fuck no. Everything matters except me. The people in power were born there, and deserve it by merit of already having it. Do I want it? Better fucking be pathalogically able to tolerate discomfort, because it basically requires living to work and then luck on top of it. And some stupid shmuck is willing to do it if I dont, and then they get to feel smug, everyone everywhere will think theyre better than me when I cant help any of the above.

And I know it sounds absurdly spoiled and fragile, but everything I just said actually legitimately causes me distress. I am unable to cope with basic reality. So long as I live in a world without star trek replicators surrounded by robots in an immortal perfect god body, I will be depressed. I will be sad and angry at everyone and everything.

"Feeling like an imposter / Derealisation Life doesn't feel real anymore. When I am surrounded by people I feel like an imposter: I copy their behaviour, their gestures, etc. to fake that I am normal being. But inside I feel like a walking corpse - I am just dead inside. There are no emotions or dreams left, I don't want to see or accomplish anything. To be honest there is only one wish left: not having to live. It is so tiring to live with this void inside myself, to push it down every day and not let it engulf everything.",depression
"Don’t think I’m making it through Winter Hey all, I’m 27M. I’ve been considering the end of it all for the last year or so. Some of my friends know that I’ve been extremely unhappy with life the past… three years? Let me walk you through my thought process.

I’ve always been depressed and extremely anxious. I refuse help, I can’t bring myself to go to the doctors or see a therapist. It’s just not an option for me. I’ve always had to be the support system for my friends and family, I can keep faking it that way. I ruin any opportunity for a relationship that comes my way because I overthink then just hide away. I can barely bring myself to go outside most days.

I live in a small town, I have the same friends that I’ve had since I was 14. We do the same things we’ve always done, but it’s not something I enjoy. I have to pretend to enjoy it still, so they have some reason to keep inviting me over. They all have families, kids, their own houses. They’re doing amazing. I’m so happy for them. I’m just stagnant. I make good enough money to have what they have, but, I’m terrified of letting people in, giving anyone a chance.

It’s not like I’m incapable of it, I’ve had a few relationships, but, I do always end up self sabotaging them in one way or another. It’s just not for me.

I have no drive, no wants, no needs. I get up, work, hang out with friends or just rot in my room. I can’t really keep doing it anymore. I feel like I’ve lived life as much as I want to. There’s nothing for me to prove, nothing for me to go home to. I don’t have pets, nobody relies on me, all my bills and loans are paid off, I’m just… tired of it all. 

I want to go back to when I was happy, looked forward to the day. When I wasn’t so anxious I make myself sick half the week. When I had dreams, had wants, when I wanted to travel. But, fuck man. Life just isn’t like that. And no matter what I’ve done, I can’t find a way to replicate it. 

I honestly think this winter is it. I won’t make it to spring. I can’t continue to keep making other people happy while not being able to feel that happiness myself. It hurts. ",depression
"Suicide attempt I had a nervous breakdown and tried  to kill myself a year ago 11-7-24. I have been in therapy the entire time since. I have no thoughts of harming myself. With the year of the attempt just days away I am nervous. I had no plans to harm myself. It was all as if I was observing myself and what I was doing. There was no pain and no fear. I ended up with stitches in my arm and wrist. I also had 30 stitches in my neck. Spent a few weeks in a mental hospital. 
So my plans are to keep busy in a positive way on the 7th. I will journal and practice mindfulness. 
Good luck to all in recovery. It’s hard but we deserve to push forward and find the happiness that is there. ",depression
"How long do I have to deal with this? I’m so exhausted. It’s been four fucking years. 

I’ve done therapy (with several therapists). I’ve tried tons of medications. I’ve done groups. I did an outpatient program TWICE. I’ve been inpatient.

I’m 23yo, have a really good job, and I’m just as bad, if not worse, than I was when this all started to fall apart.

I genuinely don’t know how to enjoy life anymore. I do fun things with friends occasionally, but even that is a ghost of what it should be. 

It’s also fucked me over with work. I’m not the kind of person who can still clock in, even if they’re a shell of themselves. I can’t even turn my damn work computer on work from home days, much less make it into the office when I need to. 

This is my first full time job and I feel like I’m on the edge of being fired. My manager sends me an email once a week about how poor my attendance is. It’s so much worse because I’m a genuinely competent employee when I’m doing well. My coworkers tell me all the time that I’ve picked things up much faster than anyone could expect from me. Hell, if I wasn’t depressed I’d be a fucking star employee. I was a star student before the depression hit. 

They’re doing layoffs next week too, which won’t help, and I don’t know what the fuck I’m gonna do if I have to find a new job. I don’t think I can make myself do it, but I live 1000 miles from my family. 

I genuinely don’t know what else to do. It’s possible I have treatment resistant depression, but all the treatments for that scare the shit out of me. Is there anything else I’m just not trying?

People who’ve actually gotten better, if it took you more than a year, how long did it take? How did you survive it?

Have any of y’all had to spend some time being unemployed so you could recover? If so, how long were you off? What did you do to heal? How did you afford daily expenses? How hard was it to get a job again after, especially if you got fired?",depression
"Childhood  TW 
I always feel a bit ashamed I never told anyone my brother sexually assaulted me as a kid. He was around 14 and I was about 3 or 4 but I remember it all. I wonder if he ever did the same to any of my other brothers and sisters. I wonder if they live with that in silence too. I get scared for my nephews because what if they were his next victim or what if he just did it to me because we were in foster care and no one cared about me at that time. I wish I could tell my mom but I know it would break her to have to choose between her kids and also the fact it was her fault we were in foster care. I wonder if she’d even believe me at all. I once told my little brother and he called me a liar , he said he could never imagine his older brother doing such a thing. I wonder if my older brother ever thinks about it when he looks at me. I wonder if he wonders if I remember. I wonder what he’d say if I brought it up to him. I wonder why he did such a thing to me. I feel like I can never let this go. It was so long ago and it still eats at me. I wonder if it eats at him too. I feel like I’ll die with this weighing me down, crushing my soul. ",depression
"Suicidal GF My girlfriend and I are long distance,. She has a lot of problems with her mental health and managing her emotions.

I just got off a video call, and she was saying things like ""I shouldn't be here/ this needs to end/ I'm tired/ I'm done/ why is my life like this""
Shes financially struggling, has no self confidence,  lives with abusive (physically and mentally) parents. 

She was crying and talking to me alot, then all of a sudden stops, acts really happy and starts smiling at me saying ""you will be ok"". She will then stare into space for 10-30 sec. Then I ask if she's OK, then she just smiles and says ""I'm ok, why do you think I'm not ok?"" 

I'm not sure how to read her and it's worrying me. I know she's attempted in the past, but I do t have a lot of experience with the last signs of when somebody is finally done/gives up.

What can I do to help? I'm trying my best but her mental state has been declining over the last few months, I don't know what to do.",depression

"I just hate my Life I know my life is not as sad as many others. I've been trying to live my life with fun, happiness, and peace. But as of recent my life has gone so downhill. I'm only 16 and part of me wishes I could just turn back time, my parents at this point in time rather care about my grades rather than how I feel.

A Majority of my grades are good, with A's and B's and only 1 C. But for my math class I have an F, even though my teacher will always bump it up to a D every 5 weeks, (So I don't take summer school) it has just kept stressing me out. When my parents found out that my Math was in an F grade, I tried explaining to my parents that I've been struggling. Yet my parents always deem it as being lazy or not asking for help. Soon after they wanted me to drop off my extracurricular activities. One of them being Acapella. I was so sad because my life was already filled with stress. My grades, my relationship, my family slowly giving me less privacy. It was horrible, yet Acapella was like a gateway to relieve my stress and forget all about it. Yet even to this day I'm still stressed. My parents were always stingy about my future, even putting me in homeschooling because I was ""doing horrible in school, and my friends were distractions"". My parents even want me to be part of a medical field when I grow up rather than letting me choose for my own future. I was even called into the school's therapy office, because I was found talking about suicidal thoughts. And now I don't know what to do. As of the time I'm writing this, I'm planning on going to school therapy since venting to strangers online might not work.",depression

When I started taking Wellbutrin it worked really well but it stopped working really quickly and when I went to the max dose I got really bad side effects so now I’m at 375 mg and that isn’t really doing anything for me.

"Will I go back to my caged life because am stupid ?  25 yo female, I had a “break” between my bachelors and my masters of 4 years, I made sure that I worked to collect enough money to study abroad in hopes to run away from my shit country where I couldn’t express my self freely (spoiler alert it’s somewhere in the Middle East) since I was a kid my dream was just to move somewhere where I can be myself fully. I met a man online and fell in love with the most amazing man in the universe who lives in Europe and gotten into a 5 years LDR where we only met 4 times in total for about 25-30 days each vacation, the more I meet/talk to him the more I fell in love. And he made me more excited to accomplish my dream of moving abroad so I was able to collect the money to fully support myself but in order for me to move to that European country I need a job and in order to get a job I need to be “in level” with the locals and rightfully so. So I decided ok I will peruse masters it was eventually one of my dreams to continue my studies so why not I did amazing and got honors in my BSc why wouldn’t it work for masters I can do well I thought to my self, since I was always really good at studying and perfected my job also. And I got it, a really prestigious university cuz I thought if I wanna be in level I gotta graduate with the best from the best uni and I got in and was the happiest girl ever, I got my student visa and moved since July and both my bf and I are renting the cutest apartment ever and living very happily together and everyday we wake up/sleep and eat next to each other even study! And am like damn this is so amazing this is the happiest I have ever been in my entire life. Studies start it is becoming more and more difficult with studies only but I am able to understand yet sadly I taken my first exam last week and I kid you not my confidence has been completely shattered I feel like shit and feel like a failure I don’t think I will succeed at all I fucked up my life is ruined is All I can think of every night before I sleep, I am wasting my money that I been collected cuz am failing in this course (we can retake exams but the point is never felt like this in my life, and if I retake I might also disturb other courses and fuck them up) I know am not alone many other students felt like they failed and they seem to be smarter than me ngl but I am shattered internally, the grades have not been publish yet it takes 25 days but I already know the results and that is making me feel depressed and anxious and stressed and all the shit feelings on earth. And all I can think of is if I fuck up my first exam ever in uni then am fucking up all the other ones too cuz this one is meant to be the easy level. And if I also keep fucking up that means I can’t get my masters and if I can’t get my masters it means that I can’t get a job once I graduate and if I can’t get a job that means I have to go back to my depressing country which alternatively means I can not be with the man that I love…. 

All this is just on my mind constantly and I can’t stop thinking about it, am not sleeping properly at all, today I slept only 2 hours and am going to class and I have deadlines and shit to do, I just feel so down and feel like I failed my self and my partner he has been nothing but supportive and reassuring but I already feel like am not gonna do well cuz I have no options, except for masters > job > happy but now I know that non of this will happen cuz am stupid and am fucking up everything. 

What also sucks is that every time am on my own and thinking obsessively about this I start crying or tearing up and that makes me get a stuffed nose and the en a migraine so it just makes it worse and worse.

Yeah that’s all I have I just need to write all of this down and rant to strangers cuz I don’t have the heart to bother or wake up my sweet man and scare him for crying at 4 am he is already having disturbed sleep from me I don’t want to bother him with that more.

"My father's depression is killing himself and I don't know what to do, I need support and help **Background:**

The past two years have made my dad more stressed than he has ever been in his life.  He and my mom downsized their home and moved into an extended stay for \~8 months while their second (much smaller) home was renovated so that they could flip the house.

While they are re-renovating, they found a crack that is causing a leak in the foundation, and it really stressed him out because now all the newly laid flooring had to be torn up, and their home has been in a state of chaos for a few years while they're getting everything fixed.

My dad had a pretty terrible childhood, moving place to place with an alcoholic and narcissistic mother.  However, he was able to pull away from that and become extremely successful in business, providing my brother and I with a comfortable life.  This has given him control issues and caused him to have long decision making processes because of his stinginess and background of being poor despite now having money.  It's also created strain on his relationship with my mother, though she has stayed by his side for over 30 years.

**What Happened:**

Last month (September), my dad was checked into the hospital for the flu.  It wasn't COVID, it wasn't actually the Flu, in fact the doctors/nurses couldn't find anything and said that he was ok to go home.  All they gave him were some OTC meds and fluids.  My dad said the doctors/nurses were trying to kill him (untrue), and at home he almost threw a 'fit' and stopped eating and drinking.  He was taken to \~10 doctors who all said there's nothing physically wrong with him and that he is clinically depressed.  He started saying that he couldn't sleep, which the doctors attributed to stress, and he refused to shower or eat/drink anything that made him extremely dehydrated.  I had to take off work on Tuesday because he was taking large, labored breaths between every word he tried to say and wanted to go to the hospital for IV fluids since he wasn't drinking.  He wanted an ambulance so he wouldn't have to wait in triage in the ER, and instead I ordered a mobile IV unit to give him fluids and he felt better.  He said he keeps throwing up, but he won't take anti-nausea medication.  He took Lexapro for two weeks, which is not long enough to make it even work, and he said he can't take it anymore.  The next day he said he felt better off the Lexapro and was prescribed Zofran, but he can't take it because he has to 'first come down from the Lexapro (?).

Things came to a head this weekend when I decided to take my mom with my family to a theme park so that she could get out.  I set my dad up with food/drink/etc. and when we came back, he hadn't eaten/drank anything and looked terrible.  I took his BP and it was 179/80, and I called an ambulance.  The doctors said that he would have died if we waited, and he went into emergency dialysis and then had a TIA stroke the next day that landed him in the ICU.  His kidneys might have completely failed because of his lack of hydration and refusal to drink.

**Advice that I Need:**

I understand that my dad is clinically depressed.  However, it seems like because of his inability to control things, he can only control what he eats/drinks/etc. so that's what he's trying to do.  He has psychologists and psychiatrists, but the main focus now is getting him food/water/sleep, and he won't even do that.  When I ask him how he's doing, he lies and tells me he eats and drinks when he didn't and that he's feeling/looking better when he's not.  We can't figure out how to help him, and it's causing us to become frustrated and confused.

If anyone has some advice on how to deal with this, I would greatly appreciate it.  I'm going to therapy myself to get through this, and my poor mom is going through burnout because he won't do anything she suggests (eat, sleep, drink, walk, sit up, etc.).

My mom is at the hospital and just called me saying the doctors said he was fine and then when she walked in he tried to make himself throw up, but since he has nothing in his stomach he was just dry heaving with some spittle (the doctor said that he didn't do that until my mom got there).

Thank you in advance!

**TLDR:** My dad's depression combined with his refusal to eat/drink/shower/walk landed him in the ICU and he still won't take steps to help himself.

**UPDATE:** He has Lupus.",depression
"help Long story short, My Husband started acting strange in March, then seemed really manic for two or three months. He was emotionally unavailable, distant, and angry. He was also paranoid. He filed for divorce, then took it back and said it was a mistake. He ended up in the psych ward for four days. And for the last few months, he’s been experiencing the darkest depression ever.  after the psych ward they added olanzapine and that didn’t really do much. Then several weeks later they added lithium (ten days ago). his current meds are 200mg sertraline,  small dose of olanzapine, clonopine and lithium.  he’s been so so so depressed, can’t hold a conversation, can’t get out of bed for days, and doesn’t work anymore. he says his depression is not getting better. But he’s not on the full dose of lithium yet, he’s had his second blood test Friday and a meeting with the psychiatrist tomorrow to see if they are going to up the lithium. is there any hope for recovery? i am starting to feel depression myself, i don’t know if i can live like this. i’m a mom of 3 and it’s really taken it’s toll.

"Poor dental hygiene, how can I explain to my dentist tomorrow  So I think I have depression, anxiety and ADHD, not certains not diagnosed but I’m on 150mg sertraline now lol, also my mum thinks I have ME/CFS bc I have a lot of the same issue she does and that’s what she has (all this is just background) 

So, probably been asked thousands of times and probably very relatable BUT, I have got to go to the dentists tomorrow for a checkup and of courseeeee I’m terrible with dental hygiene. I’m not diagnosed ADHD, I saw my GP and she got my to do a self assessment checklist and she said my results indicate I could have adhd and she sent it to some people and has just said that “they’ll contact you” so idk if that’s a waitlist or what. I also have been on antidepressant for months now keep going up basically for anxiety and depression, again not diagnosed and she just said a therapist might diagnose me we just need to keep on the path we’re at lol. 

Anyway so I just wake up and don’t think about brushing my teeth, I’m awake till I’m exhausted so I then just flop into bed and rot until I sleep, I’m ashamed to say I can go weeks without brushing properly and flossing, my dentist has told me off before and I said I’d do better and I do for a week but then it continues. Last time I saw her was before I spoke to the GP and started all this. 

SO my two questions are 1- what can I do to make my teeth look as best as they can before tomorrow lol, and 2- how can I explain why I’m so bad at dental hygiene properly idk I hate being told off I feel ashamed, my mums also going for her checkup and maybe I’ll get her to explain it but I’m literally 20 yrs old I should be able to do better :/",depression
"Emotionally scarred  Hi, I’m a woman 33 years old and I’ve felt so lost for so long. I was very sheltered growing up and I’m so confused on how to make a man happy. I don’t mean to sound narcissist, but I am very attractive and never thought it would be a problem finding a man. I had a huge secret crush on a friend and I made the first move, and he was over the moon initially. I wanted this relationship to work out for so long and I’ve known him for 15 years. What does it mean when your boyfriend won’t touch you? I walk around completely naked and he won’t even snuggle. I have to reach out and make him touch me. And then it doesn’t always lead into sex. At first I thought it would get easier, but he pushed himself farther and farther away. My love language is touch and affirmations, but he never tells me how good I look until I ask him what he thinks. I want to feel appreciated and like a true woman, but my patience has gone out the window and I turn almost violent. And I’m just asking him to hug me or hold me. 

Our worst fight we ever had was over him not wanting to spend an evening out with our friends. We were living together for almost 4 years and things were getting tense during Covid in a tiny studio with not much space. I wanted to hang out with our friends bc he seems to loosen up, but when he said he might just do something else I freaked out and took his car keys and parked his car only one street up, but when I got back he was on the phone with the police saying I was acting violent when I grabbed the keys and the police wound up arresting me and I freaked out completely. The cops were so demeaning to me and it only made me more angry. I had to bail myself out for 5k with help from another friend. My mother found out and wouldn’t even help me. I felt so abandoned. He wound up paying me back 6 months later. He threw out most of my things and packed up the rest and dropped it off at my mom’s house all behind my back. I was so emotionally hurt and I just wanted everything to be good again. He apologized and said he didn’t know that would happen when he called the police, but we didn’t get back together for almost a year. I thought I could make things work and now I just feel used. He told his family about this and now I’m never invited to anything. I have felt so lonely and angry with the world. I don’t feel like I really have a voice, and all I want is for life to be a beautiful fairytale. 

Any advice would be absolutely appreciated, thank you so much in advance. ",depression

"Don’t know what to do anymore  Hi guys, I’m just going to share some thoughts that have been on my mind lately. I have very limited support system, so getting some feedback and outside opinions on my circumstances will be nice. 

This year I’ve lost my best friend who I’ve been with since middle school. I have also lost my sister who I grew up with for basically all twenty five years of my life. 
Starting off with my best friend, we had multiple conflicts and miscommunication during the months before her wedding. We went to a small shop together to find a wedding dress for her, all went fairly well, I even got my bridesmaid dress from there. Knowing she’s on a budget, I offered to pay half of her dress as my gift for her wedding. However, my bridesmaid dress was never shipped, no notification either for weeks. I asked her, if she have received her wedding dress yet since we ordered it from the same shop, and she said yes, she have retrieved it yesterday. I was a little offended by it since she never reach out to question the status of my dress, considering that she have gotten hers. I ended up asking for a refund because the shop was taking forever to get the bridesmaid dress ready, and ordered elsewhere to make the process simpler. Then, I suggested we should get the dress tailored together. I told her the days that I’m available to met, and she completely disregarded that. She made a appointment on my work day and suggested me to come. After clarifying it with her, she suggested a different day, but at that point I didn’t want to add anymore stress for the both of us. I told her how about we each separately get our dresses fixed and tailored? Fault on my part for being wishy washy because she got upset, stating that she was being flexible and I refused to work it out with her and rather do things separately. Fast forward, I apologized again and again, tried to call two times to talk it out, all of which she refuse to corporate. We went on a month without talking after that. I was stubborn, I refuse to keep begging for forgiveness if I’ve already apologized several times…finally, on the month of her wedding, she send me a lengthy paragraph basically telling me let’s end the ten year friendship, before permanently blocking me. 
This happened on my birthday month in June. On that same month, I had a heated argument with my sister who have went through thick and thins with me. My sister who I grew up with, is my main support system, I relied heavily on her. We traveled to multiple places from out of country to in states. We share many similarities, enjoy the same hobbies together, talk on the phone for hours and when she visits me, keep each other company every single day. (You can see how this will not end well). To cut it short, we had multiple arguments even gotten a little physical, which is a fault on both of us. Right after her graduation, jobless, she told me she’s moving to a different state with her boyfriend she met for three months..logically that’s a normal thing for a young adult to do. But on my end, I can’t help but felt extremely hurt, upset, and disappointed. I understand it’s not her fault for seeking out what she wanted in life, it is her life after all. But I just felt upset over this. Few years back, she would ask if I wanted to live with her after graduation, and it’s just shocking how time changes everything. Having a sensitive, emotional, and sentimental personality makes coping with this ten times worst. As expected, we started to grow distant, going from phone calls every day to barely any messages or calls now. She tried to reach out to me once in a while, asking how I am, but I didn’t really wanted to engage in making a conversation anymore. I think I still couldn’t accept how she could just drop everything and leave, with basically a stranger she’s have met instead of staying in the comfort of my place. But it is her life at the end of the day. 

I should’ve had met more people back then, now with two of my main supporters gone, everyday felt heavier and heavier to get by. Getting “haunted” by those past memories constantly, just suck all the motivations to do anything out of me. 
Anyway, if you have read this far, thank you for taking up your time to do so. ",depression

"Should I try nortriptyline or desipramine? I did a gene test and these 2 are the only two TCA’s in the green category - all the others say I am an ultrarapid metabolizer. I have been taking clomipramine in spite of this, but it’s caused me to gain 30 pounds, so I am looking to switch to something else. I have comorbid ocd and adhd as well. It has to be a TCA because snri’s aren’t strong enough for me - I am taking pristiq but have to be taking a second antidepressant with it. Between nortriptyline and desipramine, which would be least likely to cause weight gain? I don’t know if one or the other would be better for ADHD symptoms either, as those are what I’m dealing with most. (I do also take Qelbree for that but it’s not enough on its own). I asked my psychiatrist what he thinks and he didn’t really have an opinion, so I suppose it’s up to me which one I decide to try first. ",depression
"I don't know what there is to look forward to. Half of me wants help and the other half wants to be left alone. The only reason I'm even putting it on reddit is that I practically refuse to find a new therapist for the millionth time. Nothing they say works for me and I don't think they can say anything to me that I couldn't say to myself for free. Knowing that I'm paying someone to misinterpret me places a permanent wall between us.

I hate saying ""I wish I was dead"" because I know that's not the solution to the problem. But like man I am the cause of my problems half the time. So maybe it is. Idk.

I set myself up to be judged because my brain never ever ever stops thinking for a second and I don't trust myself to know for sure if I've done something wrong. But then I get all mad if someone says yes. I'm not even mad at them, I'm mad at myself for asking. I'm mad at myself for getting input. Especially in a place like reddit (yet here I am). I'm mad at myself for continuing to obsess over things that I can't change, and making myself a fool in the process. I don't know how anybody can stand to be around me. Something just isn't right and I can pretend I'm getting better but in the end I'm just pretending.

I feel like my brain doesn't work. Or it does, but too much in the wrong place, and some other part simply never got the message. It can't be that simple (I'm sure this is a result of many years of intentional bad decisions, or something). But I wish it was. I wish anything could fix me.",depression

It’s not my job, I know, but the moment I speak up - I get told I’m making myself the victim. I’ve come to accept that I’ll just be happy when I’m dead.

"Struggling a month into a new job I began a new job a month ago and ive had big ups and downs throughout the entire time. Currently, I feel like shit and its hurting me to go every day, even though I have to.

I work at an insurance company and I am afraid that I am a disappointment and I’m going to get fired. I can’t stop bringing myself down about this and I am unsure if I am overthinking.

The work I do is pretty complex, with very different ways of doing things for each task that really require you to know specific information to understand it. Most of the time I feel like I am on my own trying to figure things out. 

My supervisor is responsible for me and is there in person only 3 times a week, working 2 days remotely. Its very difficult to get a hold of her because she is so busy while also yapping about her personal life to co workers on zoom calls. When I am able to get her to show me something, its for about 30 minutes to an hour.

I am a temporary employee in this position, and the only good thing ive heard so far about my performance is that my supervisors boss encouraged me to apply for a full time position that opened up, and that they are happy with the work I’ve done. Its been a week and I haven’t heard anything about it again.

My co workers also dont seem open at all to helping me, and when I do ask for help in the most respectful way I can, they seem slightly irritated like I am interuppting them but what else can I do? No matter when I try it is always that way.. also there is only four people in the office max at a time so we are severely understaffed.

I feel like an idiot asking for help all the time, like I am behind and just not understanding things like I should. I dont want it to seem like im lazy or just not trying to understand, because I truly am trying my best. 

At one point I heard a co worker kind of talking shit about me complaining that they are on the service counter that day, and that I am still listed as “other” on the schedule. Like wtf am I supposed to do im not knowledgable enough to do that yet!

My boss seemed slightly agitated today because I was asking so many questions and it really upset me. I just really dont want to mess up because with the work I do it is important to be accurate. I am afraid I am going to get fired and all of this was for nothing. I am afraid that I am messing up on the work I do, but I feel like an idiot saying that to them and that it’ll make me look even worse.

"I feel like no one around me understand the depressive believes i have so i made a kind of story. Maybe some people can relate. Its a big read. TL;DR added. What it is like

TL;DR

I’ve been struggling with depression for over four years, feeling alone and misunderstood. Although my friends try to help, they don't truly get what I'm going through. I'm scared that being honest about my feelings will make others see me as a failure, so I constantly try to prove my worth in every part of my life. This pressure leaves me feeling stuck and questioning my value. I fear that if I reach out for help, I’ll be judged or given superficial advice, making it hard for me to connect with others or find the support I need.

What it is like

Alone. I feel so alone in life. I feel like being in the middle of a crossing on the street and everyone walking past me busy with their lives. Meanwhile I am standing still unable to move. Unable to get anyone’s attention. Unable to ask for help.

I am struggling with depression for over 4 years or longer and no one ever understand me. I cannot make people understand me. I know people notice but they don’t know what to do. So, they just leave me alone. Which is the opposite of what I want. But I can’t reach out.

I feel like if I reach out people will not understand me or give superficial advice. After which I seem like someone who just wants to stay depressed.

My friends know I am not 100% and they try in their own way to motivate me but they just don’t understand what it is like. I feel like if I am truly honest about my feelings people will see me for the loser, I think myself I am. The loser who won’t get further in life and will remain stuck. Stuck in a repeated pattern constantly fighting against myself and winning just enough to survive through the days.

I don’t want anyone to think of me as a failure. I have been a failure all my life. I want people to know me as successful, proud, honest, kind and interesting. Not depressed, lonely, failing and boring. Which is my opinion of myself.

It feels like all aspects of my life are hanging by a thread. I hold the strings together by portraying myself how I want people to see me. Because I am afraid that if I stop fighting and show them how much of a failure in life I really am they will leave me over time. Distancing themselves from me because I am the only one who cannot move forward. And going through this life without them feels like a death sentence. I cannot fathom why they would want to be friends with someone like me. In the current state that I am in. I cannot fathom being the one in a friendship with nothing to offer. Which I think I am. But am not admitting nor acting in this way. I go over mountains to give value to friendships and meet ups and parties so people will be content with me. I feel like they will leave when I have nothing to give. When I am at my lowest.

Furthermore, it scares me being at my lowest. I waste my potential day by day by surviving this way. It scares me when I look in the mirror and see in what for pit I am. Like being in the darkness of space and seeing this one star. This one star that represents the joys I still experience today.

A star that just keeps getting further and further away from me until there is nothing anymore. Just me in this survival state. Unable to get better. All bridges burned. All hopes of support gone. Waiting for the end.

Its even come to a point where I just accept, I am a failure stuck in life with friends leaving and being lonely in life and death that I forget the very things that make me feel this way.

Why. Why am I feeling this way?

I feel like I have accomplished nothing of worth in my life. I have a life but have nothing to show for it. I can’t justify my existence. I feel like I have to do something extraordinary to be worthy of it. I feel like I have to prove I am worthy of having gotten this far. I need something to show for it. And I got nothing.

Most of my childhood I was rejected by almost everyone. My childhood was literally the busy crosswalk.

It went better later in life when I was actively pursuing a good job through my studies and was accepted by my classmates. Now when I have a good job I have to prove I am worthy of it. Every project I work on has the potential to make me worthy or unworthy of my job. And even my best may not be enough against my competition aka coworkers.

This feeling of having to prove I am good enough has spread to every corner of my life. From my job to my relationships to my aspirations, needs and wants. If I feel like I did not prove myself enough I will be unworthy of any aspect of life that comes that day.

 

Sometimes at my job I feel like I have proven myself for the day and I feel proud and act as I want. Free expression. Yet in many areas of my life, I rarely or never feel worthy.

I constantly do not feel worthy of a relationship or love. For what is there to love? I may be kind, funny or any other bland aspects found in most boring personalities but I do not have a wow factor which will make worthy of love. That one special quality or aspect of personality that will convince me I am worthy.

And here comes the most bland, superficial, boring, unusable advice ever given in the history of advice.

“Don’t worry about it that much”

Let’s go back to the crossing. That one crossing where I am standing in the middle with everyone walking past me. Eventually someone walks up to me and sees just me standing in the middle and says: why don’t you just move?

The thought of just taking step after step seems simple enough. But in what direction? And even then. As I am about to take a step my body freezes like an electrical current is flowing through my muscles tightening it so that I cannot move.

A shadow of myself appears and tells me:

*What have you proven to be worthy of moving. And are you certain that you will be worthy of taking this action after you have reached your destination. For if you are not you will never walk again. Then you will have certainty you are to remain in the middle of this busy crossing. Are you willing to moving to an unknown destination with the risk of never being able to move again.*

 is example might seem far fetched so here is another.

Say I am at a party of sorts and get a girl’s attention. Which is already pretty rare because of how I hide myself from it. Let’s say we hit it off and we eventually get on a date. On the date she discovers that I have a kinda interesting job, still lives at home, mostly game, sometimes goes on a walk or take a swim. Has many hobbies which he does not really participate in. Hangs out mostly with his friends drinking a beer. And had one previous relationship which wasn’t really that well structured. The girl eventually figures out that this is kinda boring and uninteresting. She decides to leave.

In this scenario I present my true self and that is not worthy enough.

Of course, I already have a feeling of unworthiness so this will be an outcome no matter what.

As long as I believe I am unworthy of love I will be unworthy of love. And as long as my life is the way it is now in terms of accomplishments, I will believe I am unworthy of love. Love of any kind that is.

Now the next step might be obvious. Change the way my life is. And here comes the cycle. For I have not been idle and have tried this many times.

I seek to walk away from the busy crosswalk. I take a step. I ignore the words of my shadow. I keep walking in a certain direction. But I never arrive anywhere. I look in the distance and do not see the thing I want. The thing I think will change my life for the better albeit small. Withered by a feeling of defeat and a hopeless thought of not finding what I am looking for I turn back to familiar ground. The busy crosswalk. At least here I have perspective. I turn into another street. I see something that might help me. Some aspect which will make my life more worthy. For a time walking down this street feels good. But eventually the road begins to turn so steep I fall down. I try again and fall down, again. I look and look but find no way to climb it. Looking at my watch I am shocked how much time has passed by exploring 2 streets. I have spent so much time achieving nothing that I give up and return to the crosswalk. Waiting for the perfect path to arrive so I won’t waste any more time with the pursuit of illusionary paths of change.",depression

"Scared feeling of going crazy Hi, I’m 18(m) and I just created this account to post this. I haven’t attended school since summer. And I’m scared of going crazy/insane. When I leave the house, I get a lot of unwanted thoughts. When I bike to school I get constant extremely weird thoughts. For example, what if I crashed into that car over there? Or: what if I just killed myself right now? I’m scared, I don’t want to think about these things at all. 

The further I am from home, my safe space (bed) I get extremely anxious when I focus on the fact I’m not home. I’m scared of not being able to move my way back home (my limbs literally not wanting to move) over the last year, when I think about moving my body. I just feel weird about it. Like, how do I move? How am I able to move? That gets me all weird and scared i that won’t be able to move anymore. Like my brain just can’t do it anymore.

Whenever I see someone kill themselves on the news I get scared. What if I become like that one day? What if I lose control one day and do something weird? 

Other than that, the thoughts can also intensify at school, or when I’m with someone. Like, what if I punch this person right now or what if I just pull my pants down? My thoughts are always there and it’s hard to avoid. I’m hopeless, and don’t know what to do. I don’t wanna feel like this, I just want to live a normal life not rotting in bed all day. However, when I’m gaming or doing something intensive, my attention drifts away and I don’t think about it. 
Also, weirdly enough, whenever I feel uncomfortable, I get the urge to touch myself. Idk why this is.

These annoying thoughts, combined with panic attacks, make it really difficult for me to function normally in this society. It’s stopping me from getting a job, or even attending school.

Is there anything I can do? Am I going crazy?",depression
"I want to kill myself  Lately, I’ve lost nearly all of the people that I’ve loved and cared about. It’s not that they have died or anything, most of them just something they thought were more important to them than me. I just feel like I’m a fucking bandage that just gets thrown away after healing someone and now I’m still together with a girl i promised to myself would be the last person i would ever try to hold a relationship with or try to ever open up to. Now she’s saying that she still has feelings for her ex and is debating if she should go back to him or not. Mind you this is while we are together and I’m just scared of losing her because i have attachment issues, due to how i have always been the second choice, the person you only talk to when you don’t have anyone else and the person that gets abandoned. I’m convinced that if she leaves I’m going to kill myself, she was the only reason that i have been alive this long and if she leaves i loose that purpose.",depression
"Success stories from switching antidepressants? Going from SSRI to SNRI? I (30F) have tried a few different medications over the years. I'd say anxiety is the main issue, but that combined with social isolation has definitely driven me into a depression. I was on Celexa in college but truthfully didn't really feel anything on it. Plus my situation changed and I felt comfortable getting off of it. I've had depressive episodes over the years that came and went, but I never prioritized medication again. Last year I was going through an incredibly rough time deciding to end a relationship (lost interest in most things, wasn't sleeping, threw up often from anxiety) and decided to get on Lexapro. The first few weeks were awful getting adjusted, but once I got over the hump I'm honestly not sure if it was really helping me. Again, I deprioritized it and eventually weaned off of it once my situation started looking up (mostly having things planned with friends and ending that period of social isolation).

All that said, this year has been the most trying so far. I try to put myself out there and meet people, make plans with friends, focus on my career/hobbies, etc. but it feels like they're all just distractions from a deep discomfort within myself. My friendships/connections feel superficial. I work remotely and spend most of my time alone. Dating has been draining and disheartening. The second I slow down, it all hits me. The fatigue, the loss of appetite, the constant nausea, the insomnia, the lack of interest in doing *anything*... I knew I needed to address the underlying fears driving my anxiety and driving me into depression, but I knew medication was a first step and that I really needed to make it a priority this time, not just hop on and off whenever my situation changed. It's clear that  I need to work on my ability to cope and function regardless of my situation.

I started Pristiq a few days back and the side effects I had on Lexapro came screaming back to me... the insomnia, the horrible nausea/vomiting, the jitters, the worsening depression/anxiety as I get acclimated, etc. I don't have any experience with SNRI's as opposed to SSRI's but I'm really hoping there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Has anyone here had success switching from one to another? These side effects feel 10 times worse than the depression and I'm just hoping to come out the other side stronger.",depression

how do i tell if i have depression or i am just tired? Lately i’ve been working a lot and have been very busy with school. As a result i don’t feel like doing stuff as often. I would rather just chill in my room and watch tv then hop on xbox with my friends and go out. I still do these things but just not as often. I don’t respond to texts for hours. I see them but i just don’t feel like answering.  I also don’t feel like talking to my family i just want to be left alone. Sometimes i’ll get angry when my family comes around me and other times i won’t. I wouldn’t consider myself a super motivated person also but i feel like i’ve just been doing the bare minimum recently. I would never go above and beyond but i feel like my effort has been getting worse and worse.

Taking a gap year seems appealing, but I'm worried it would be a waste of time and academic progress and my family would most likely not support it either. I've chosen a course that doesn't interest me, and I lack any real ambition or drive. No course in general interests me. All I want to do is stay in bed and avoid the world.

"Not sure why I should go on. Tired of being alone or used.  Its 1 AM and i just need to get this off my chest. 

I literally just don't know what to do anymore. I grew up with a loving family and was the eldest between me and my brother blah blah blah. I was raised in my life that I should dedicate my life to paying my family back for raising me. But the way I was taught growing up forced me to be a loner and loser.   
Rules.  
1. I could only wear clothes and accessories approved by my family. 

2. My male friends were strictly vetted to the point where my family would even call these peoples parents and tell them not to let their kids associate. 

3. If i was found with a females number on my phone i was be strictly disciplined. (included the parents talking to not let us associate.)

Punishments for these included not being able to enjoy hobbies, beatings, emotional abuse, and more than once I was locked in my basement. 

My cousin that i grew up with maybe two years older then me. He continually lied on my name. Telling my parents i did something i didn't do or said something i didn't say. Leading to more of these punishments. At one point my punishment was to go to school, come home. And be locked in my room with literally nothing. Not even a paper and pen. no books. No entertainment. All because he said i disrespected him in a way i didn't do. 

At one point i broke down leading my family to forced me to attend this religious focus group that taught me basically the same rules listed above. And i did it because maybe if i made my parents happy i could get some sort of freedom. 

All of this led me to be the loner and loser i am today. unable to make friends. Unable to find a relationship with girls. I don't even fit into my local community. People will say out loud not to talk to me and that i'm weird or challenged or some other horrible disrespectful stuff pertaining to my race or character or upbringing. 

  
Now here comes my brother. Someone who didn't have to follow any of these rules. Who wasn't brought up with a shit bag cousin lying on his name. He gets whatever designer clothes he wants. Allowed to wear gold and silver (I was beaten for asking the same). Allowed to be friends with whoever he wants. Allowed to go to other females houses (something i was locked away for even asking for). Mother fucker even had sex on MY bed while both our parents were downstairs. Uk who drove him to these females houses while girls in bikinis were waiting outside for him. Me. Uk what would happen if i refused? This emotionally manipulative bullshit that i owe my family for raising me. Raising me how? To be a fucking loser? To not let me enjoy the life he was given the freedom to have. 

My ex that i have fought tooth and nail to be with left me not to long ago and ill explain why. My parents didnt like her and at times disrespected her. They told both of us if we got married to never speak to them again. My little brother was allowed to go to whore after whores house with me as his personal driver but i finally find someone special to me that's my treatment? Yea i could've been better to at times. But i was never taught how to love or interact properly. Even she said it to me before it ended. 

I dont plan to hurt myself in anyway. But i want to carve my heart out. i explained all this to my family before but all they say is stop saying this its in the past, while i watch my younger sibling do everything i wanted to do. If or when i do decide enough is enough. i want them to read this over my corpse. I dont have enough money to be able to leave. If i did and i didnt have to pay my parents for raising me along with school bills and whatnot i would have left a long time ago. But im also scared to leave. Even if im treated poorly its better then being alone. With my skills i wouldn't even make new friends. id be alone in my apartment anyway. 

  
Sorry about all the grammar and spelling mistakes im tired. I just needed to write this so i can have some peace of mind to sleep.

Oh if anyone plays bo6 my in-game name is the same as my reddit user and I'm really bad. ",depression

It just feels like it's gotten really bad again like it was when I was in middle school.

I tend have these breakdowns that are really intense and sometimes they last longer than others and right now it's been going on for about a week and I'm tired I feel worn out mentally and physically.  At night I don't do my little routine anymore before bed because it feels exhausting even though it's nothing crazy.. what's triggered all this is idk lots of things. I've been lonely my whole life too I'd say I didn't have a normal social life I've had what I'd call a phone addiction since like 11. Mostly addicted to talking to friends I've met or just using it as a form of comfort which has majorly fucked me up now I can't tell you how many times I've been checking my phone these past few days like it'll magically heal me. Especially at night when I'm completely alone in my room it's like I can't put it down and just sit with my thoughts it's genuinely bad.. I've been feeling extra alone lately which has caused this major depressive episode I won't get into details because it is about my relationship and I don't want to discuss topics that include someone close to me like that on a post like this just it's been hard cause I feel my whole life I've been the person comforting me and I don't often feel comforted by other people. I just want to have that feeling that someone else cares besides myself.

Its really hard for me to feel so completely alone it's happened multiple times in my life and it's gotten to a point where I feel so over it like why can't I just feel good why do things keep happening? it's like an endless loop i keep going through the same things at different points in my life. I want to feel like i can be vulnerable without being scared I'm too much but I think maybe that's just how it's supposed to be? I'm too much and it's something people don't want which i don't blame them at all I'm probably draining to be around especially for my partner I guess I'm writing all of this cause no matter what I do i can't stop thinking bad things or crying and I know the only thing that will make me feel better is talking to the person I need to and getting out of this episode but right now it feels like the end of the world for me which I know is silly. I wish it was easy being human but it's not and it's hard to find how I'm supposed to feel content in life with the problems I have. There's so much more I could say and ramble about but I'm not good with words at all and I feel stupid so yeah.",depression

Also, I am so afraid of finding a job after my exams end. I feel like a useless person and nobody is ever gonna hire me. 

The worst part is I'm so lonely but I'm also scared to date again after my last break up. I still miss my ex and want everything to go back to how it was.

"I'm Honestly Scared & Confused I'm 21 years old,I live with my grandma because she just lost grandpa and doesn't want to be alone she also has dementia so I have to be very patient and careful with her regarding what I say otherwise she cries.
I moved out of mom's to take care of grandma
Currently I work security and have my free 2 years from the state of Michigan for community collage.

The reason why I said all of that is to give a little backdrop, I don't know what I want out of life and I'm thinking how bout how I have no actual reason to live, if I die my dog will be safe with family, if I die my grandma can be taken care of,
My sister hates me or at least heavily dislikes me
I don't talk to my mom anymore because of her bi polar disorder scaring me with how frequent she changes moods Currently using her as a proxy for insurance by paying her the fee so I don't get screwed over by insurance companies.
For the 1st year of my life I managed to keep a job (security) for long enough I made enough for taxes so that's something else for me to be scared of because I don't know how to do taxes.
I have a bad porn addiction that I wasted thousands of dollars on but I've stopped that and stopped wasting my money on that stuff. I'm trying to lose weight and get a better diet
I have no diet and I don't have the motivation to actually work out so I've gotten sorta husky. I can't get a girlfriend because after every 1st date it just dies out.
My social skills are terrible because I've been told all my life to speak up or shut up, I have no friends and recently I asked a female co worker out on a friendly outing (movie)  after discovering neither of us had friends, we exchanged numbers but this morning she said she didn't want to have a relationship or be friends.
So I'm feeling rejected and just bad all around.
I can't find the motivation for anything, I have a broken headlight on my car, I ordered the parts and that was over a month ago and I still haven't fixed it out of sheer laziness.
In short I'm lost and confused what I want in life and how to do it and I'm scared.

I can't smoke or cut. Those are the only things that make me feel anything. This numbness is tiring and sometimes exhausting. My faith in humanity is low as always. Humans make me sick. Most relatable sentences, am i right?

"Dont know what to do anymore /venting Im sorry if this is long.

I dont know what to do. Im married (27m) with a 1 year old child with my wife and have a small dog. My wife doesnt work due to the baby and i work full time.

Due to some unforseen circumstances, in 2022 we ended up moving in with her parents. Since then, i feel like its been the worst decision of my life. I do not get along with her father, he judges me constantly and talks about me constantly behind my back, etc. I know im not perfect but he is constantly on my case about literally everything and at this point its just annoying. Ive became extremely detached from everything since being here. It actually feels very similar to my childhood situation when i lived with my emotionless mother, i use to lock myself away which is what is happening now.

 I have tried to be better: I have gone to therapy, seen a psychologist, taken medication for anxiety and depression, gone to the gym, and eaten better. No matter what I do, someone points out that I am doing things wrong. ""You're not a real man because you don't have your own place and cannot provide for your family"" or ""You don't go to the gym enough; you make excuses."" These comments trigger ""PTSD-like"" symptoms in me because my father used to say similar things, as did my mother's husband. I don't know why the adult men around me feel the need to target me like this, but my therapist suggested that it might be because they are intimidated by me. I don't know.

The gym thing, for example, I used to go four to five days a week. My wife complained that it was hard for her to watch the baby for longer hours and asked if I could cut back, so I did. I would come home and take care of the baby until I got rest for work. I ended up only going to the gym one to three times a week. Guess what happened next? He came and said I was making excuses and that I wasn't man enough to make time to go to the gym more. I was done. Since that altercation, I decided not to care anymore and just do what I feel is right, but nothing I do is right to anyone. Even my marriage is extremely strained. I want to move out, but I don't want to leave my daughter behind. I know with work and everything it will be hard for me to tend to her on my own, so the best bet is to have her stay with her mom, but I just can't find it in me to leave. It's also hard due to financial reasons; places around me charge an arm and a leg.

My therapist asked me what I have done so far in life, and the only things I can think of are that I graduated high school, left for the Army right after and served six years, work full-time now, and have a child. She tells me to feel proud of my accomplishments, but others put them down.

I'm just at a loss and don't know what to do with my life. I know I'm not perfect, but why do people feel the need to point out all my flaws and problems? Some days I just want to end it all, and others I feel like I can't miss out on my little one's life as she would need me. 💔 I am sorry again for this long post.",depression
"I'm so lost from the title, and the page we're on, you can prolly assume what ima talk abt. also btw sry for any typos.

okay so for context, im a 14 year old girl and ive been depressed since 5th or 6th grade. ik yall may not beleive it,but ig thats just how this works. i also come from a pretty well off family. actually, like- reall well off. see most people are like, ""omg i wish i was rich"" but being rich and being in a high class is differeent. being in the upper class is constant pressure. i have to do 5 sports, i am taking 4 AP classes(im only a freshman) and i have to get into a good college or else ill lowke be disowned. sometimes idk what to do. its so much pressure to do good, but i dont wanna do it anymore.

okay, so ive been honor roll track since kindergarden, taking art classes and everything. i even went to that kumon shit they have kids do to get better at math or smth. and in like 4th grade, that was fine. we were in covid so it was a nice break. i had basically no friedns to miss, so that wasnt an issue. i know covid is when a lot of depression started, but not mine. 

so when we came bac from covid, my one friend i had left me for another group. i was basically a loner. i was the ""weird kid"" and no one liked me. but then we moved from nyc to florida in 6th and that was better. i got a new tsart and now i have a lot of firends. why a i not happy? because now im in 9 extra curiculars, 2 sports at the current moment, and im juggling all these honor and AP classes. 

im so burnt out of life rn. its too much and i just dont wanna try anymore. but i also dont wanna die. its not a su!c!de thing, just a dpression, sorta thing. i lowkey just feel numb.

anyone out there that can relate? im so done.",depression

"How do I tell my girlfriend that she's damaging my mental health How do I tell my girlfriend that my mental health is in a shit state, and she's contributing to this?

Context: 
I have pre-existing childhood trauma that really affects my self worth and confidence that I'm not going to go into here, but the full story is in another post I made if anybody wants to see. 
I'm a Medic in the Royal Navy, I fucking love my job, and without wanting to big myself up I'm pretty good at it. 

I (25m) live with my girlfriend (23f) of two years, and lately I've been struggling a lot. 
Of the two of us she is definitely the smarter, she's got her shit together. 
Meanwhile I'm waiting on an ADHD referral
Sometimes I do dumb shit or just don't think of things. The result is that I feel like I'm under scrutiny all the time, because I feel like she don't respect me or trust me. 
There's times I feel micromanaged and it's very disheartening.

I'll admit I do dumb shit sometimes, but the problem is that if I'm under scrutiny, I overthink. When I overthink I make mistakes; and it's a repeating cycle and a self fulfilling prophecy 

I don't know how to resolve this because I can't expect her to just suddenly trust me, but I do want her to not automatically assume that I'm being an idiot. 

It's really depressing because I know I'm no more of an idiot than the next man but then I feel like I'm useless

It's not just that either, one thing that's been causing a big problem is the fact that my hearing isn't great. It's got not much to do with actual hearing as it does with ADHD. When I discussed it with my doctor we discussed the possibility that I might have auditory processing disorder - which is part of ADHD- where you can have good hearing but if you have background noise, you're concentrating on something, or anything else that could distract you you just don't hear other things. 
We went bowling tonight and the music was very loud but she would talk at a normal level, so I didn't have a hope of hearing and kept asking her to repeat herself so she stopped bothering to talk to me at all so we ended up bowling in all but silence and it was utterly crushing

"Sleepy I’m still young, almost 17, but i’m done living. I cant really function anymore. Idk if I’m actually sad, but i keep having this desire of killing my self for years now. I’m really disconnected from reality, from my emotions. I cant understand how i feel, who i am. I have potential, they say. I’m smart, attractive, mature, they say, and i’m fully aware. But i can’t take this anymore. I don’t want responsibility, i dont want people to even think of me or expect me to do something in life. I don’t even want it. We live in a disgusting and distopic world, why should i want to be here. 
I cant even take care of myself lately. I’m skipping school, too many sweats, and i cant stand people anymore. 
It’s not like i want to die, i just wish i’ve never been born. I’m a terrible daughter, i cant have a proper stable relationship with anyone and with my self, i’m so inadequate for everything. I wanna destroy every memory everyone has of me, and i’ll go to sleep now wishing i wont wake up in the morning. ",depression

"don't want to commit suicide but I wish I was never born I've dealt with depression for years now and usually it centers around something or another that I feel is devastating and unchangable, It's an awful feeling but lately things have just been different and I don't really understand it honestly.. I just feel like nothing really can heal this feeling inside of me. I used to look at the crimson and yellows of fall leaves and feel a sense of wonder or appreciation for the beauty and nuances of life. 

Now it's hard for me to stop and forget how dejected I feel, I just continue the cycle of using anything I can to forget even for a moment that I'm alive and how I feel this way. I just think about my life and everything that's happened, everything that's shaped me into this person. I guess I feel defective if that makes sense. I'm so tired, I've only slept an hour or two for the last couple nights. My mom is struggling so much and I'm watching my relatives decline, my grandparents struggle and have their own issues, I keep thinking to myself - I wish I was a better person, If I could just get my shit together I could save my mom, maybe things could be better for us and we could leave this awful period of held breath and stagnation that were both struggling so much with.

I guess I just feel like I can't do this, I've always had it in the back of my mind that things turn out okay, but the older I get I'm realizing that many things are outside of your control and the only thing that you can really do is stay alive. I'm just so tired. I don't know really even know where to start to take the reins in my life, I try but I'm just drifting along in the wind..",depression
My friend needs help My best friend has been struggling with bipolar disorder and awful trauma her whole life and we always talk things through a and i know at the end of the day she’ll be okay but im really worried about her right now. what worries me is usually im able to give her really sound advice that resonates with her and helps but last time we talked there was really nothing i could say to help she is just so sad and i dont know what to do but i want to help. its hard for her to tell what phase she’s in objectively because there’s so much in her head but as an outsider and someone who knows her i can see she was probably manic up until a few months ago and is now in a huge depression swing but its really bad. she knows the only thing that will help her is therapy but she can’t get in to ANY clinics she’s reached out to so many places and no one will take her or offer help it’s so fucking disappointing. She’s pretty against big pharma and has never felt like her meds have helped her mentally so she’s not taking anything and just genuinely wants a good therapist. i don’t like better help and sites like that i feel like they are more profit oriented than establishing a good connection with someone so please any advice on how i can help or clinics to look into??? ,depression
"I think I’m better Since 2020, I didn’t realize it but I was depressed. I thought it was just my personality changing from being isolated. When I got back to school in 2022, it didn’t feel the same. I was a freshman in high school and I was already worried about that fact. When it started, I was extremely worried about talking to people. I started to mumble when I talked to people, I talked quieter, and because of those 2 things on top of me being already worried, I think it sent me into a depression. I developed body dysmorphia, I stopped talking to my classmates. I didn’t realize what was happening to me at the time but now it’s so clear. 

I clearly knew something was wrong, but I thought I was just being dramatic. Probably for the last 3 months or so, I was feeling more confident about my self. I started to go out of my comfort zone more often. I began going to the gym more. I’ve been getting better for a while and I didn’t even realize. 

I’ve been looking up how it feels to come out of being depressed, and it’s pretty much exactly what I’m feeling. The sun shines brighter, you feel better about yourself, you start talking to people more, you think about things differently and in a better way, you feel like you can pretty much do anything. A few days ago I woke up, and something was very different. I used to get mad about every little thing in the world. I would hate people for no reason. I’d hate myself. A few days ago, it’s like I just woke up and knew something was different. It’s like there was a switch inside of me that was stuck in the sad position. I felt as if no one was looking at me as close as before. For the past 4 years I’ve felt as though every single one of my moves was being watched. Every time someone laughed around me I would think they were laughing about me. I felt very self conscious about the clothes I was wearing and even things as small as where I was putting my hands. The past few days I’ve been thinking it might be mania or something. I don’t have a history of being bipolar or anything, but I’ve heard of it. Now I look back and see that I was just getting better. It’s like those 3 months we’re building up to this exact moment, and the switch finally flipped. I feel as though I will never go back to who I was during those 4 years. I would have never been able to sit here and write all of these words in the state I was in. I have never felt so clear minded in my life. It’s like I’m a kid again, with no worries in the world


I think and know now that depression takes time to heal from. If you are suffering from anything that sounds like mine, please get help! It is no way to live how I was for so long. I was so scared to reach out and talk about my feelings. But you shouldn’t be. Everyone thinks the same, no one is looking at you, you’re simply a person, trying to do the best they can. I feel like I am alive again, and you will too when you get through it. It definitely takes time, when you’re in a depressive state you don’t believe any of the words that are said to you, but just trust me cause I have literally felt the same way. Don’t ever think that you are never gonna be better, because you genuinely will, I never thought I would ever be the same again. And if you are coming out of your own depression, it’s normal to kind of obsess about how you randomly got better one day. I just thought I might help a few of you. Just trust the words I say, and you can get better. ❤️‍🩹

"Working with Depression Hi, 

This is a genuine question I have for other people without high functioning depression and may even have executive dysfunction. How do you force yourself to work when its one of those days that you're struggling to get out of bed or do anything? 

  
I have been searching for a job for the past year and I am struggling on how to explain to jobs why I left previous jobs. I left my second job because my family felt like my depression was so bad and I was so suicidal that I needed to be in a psychiatric hospital. So, I quit, because they needed someone to work there and I wasn't even full time and I was unsure of how long I would be in the hospital. I quit my first job because I was working at a call center where I was getting 50-80 calls daily and I barely had downtime because of my second shift schedule. I didn't even leave the house on weekends because my social battery would be completely depleted from talking to 100s of people throughout the week. 

I tell jobs I left for medical reasons, but that doesn't seem to be enough for them when I left two jobs for the same reason. I'm only 23. My emotions feel so overwhelming on those bed rotting days and I'm already thinking about disappearing and not wanting to be alive more times than I should without my anti-depressants (psychiatrist practice shut down). I'm stressed because I can't find a job because of these and obviously other reasons and I'm stressed about what to do on those days that your brain just wants to bed-rot. Or you're feeling anxiety about how many people you have to deal with at work. Do I just stop trying to work in customer service. 

  
I really feel like I'm on my last leg and everything feels so suffocating and not worth it. I don't know want to live my life anymore because it feels like I've just been on a decline ever since I turned 18. And I don't see it getting any better no matter how many times my family and friends say things will. I just don't believe it. How can I keep going when I'm so pessimistic about staying alive. How are people even getting themselves out of bed? ",depression
"The Sun doesn't shine like it once did. Life has become so disappointing lately. The bad officially outweighs the good. Life is all about work, a thankless job. Zero free time. I haven't taken any time off since 2022, and it still feels like I'm not doing enough. Bad things will continue to happen to good people. It's become easier to be numb than to feel at all. ",depression
"I just give up This is just a post to say I’m done I give up. I’ve tried to be better in work and life and with people and I just don’t think I can. I’m not suicidal exactly but I don’t have the will to live. I lost my grandfather who was my best friend almost 2 years ago and I have lost all internal thoughts and feelings. My family who is the only reason I’m around for as they need support in helping provide for the lives of others. I have sisters who rely on me a grandmother who does a mom who is retired all of them need me to work to provide for them. I believe my job is about to shift me to another location without any of my say or knowledge of what’s happening I have helped provide for everyone in my life in anyway they need but I can provide for myself. I’ve tried relationships therapy anything to just make myself feel somewhat like a person or normal or regular but I just fall into all day marijuana use random sex with women so ill feel something and because of my mind snapping from so much weighing on me and constant anger at life and just myself I always am just alone. So I guess this is a long winded way to say I’m not suicidal I don’t want to hurt myself but I just don’t wanna be here and have no choice. Toronto is not a nice place either. 

Thanks ",depression

"I’m about to kill myself.  I’ve been struggling with depression on and off since I was 17. I’ve attempted twice and couldn’t get it right, well now I’m 24 and I can’t take it anymore. I have family and friends but I still feel so cast out and so alone. I even fear talking about how I feel will do nothing for me but make others worry. I also have a 4 year old daughter and for so long she’s the reason I’ve even stayed in this world so much longer. I love her so much but I just can’t do it anymore. She’s part of a huge family that will love her and take care of her while I’m gone. My only fear is that this attempt won’t work and I’ll be forced to treat this depression again. It’s all too much, I feel like a burden and I’m the black sheep on my family. They all think I’m annoying, my own mother said it to me a couple days ago and never apologized.

"Tired of life Feeling so alone and unloved. I don't know how to continue living like this. I live abroad, and once a year I visit my home country it turns out to be constant fights, screaming that make to do self harm. So many childhood traumas, family members struggling with their own demons.
 I have a hard time making friends I feel like I'm not even the second tier person to the people, not sure if I'm the third tier. 

Mutual friends I introduce to each other seem to be hitting off better with me excluded, which is ok, but it feels so abandoning some times. People keep bailing on plans to hang out, it feels like they only can see me only when all of the other people are not available.
Never had a normal relationship (36F), seems like men only want me for sex, and no one see me as a person.

I feel like a shadow, abandoned, worthless, unseen and forgotten. People at work and at social functions walk off in the middle of me speaking. I just wish someone cared about me.

Went to the therapy for years, tried medications, nothing seem to work.
Tired of living like this, tired of trying to better myself and my life, but it all seem worthless.

 Gravitating more towards finding the will to end it all, as more therapy and more self work seems like a waste of time as no one likes or cares for me. It feels like it never gets better. ",depression

"I feel like I will end my life soon even if I don't want to. I just want the pain to stop. I want the crying to stop. Its been almost half a year. The person I loved the most left me. Gave up on me.

Even after meeting me, I guess I wasn't good enough to plan a future with. It's pathetic, isn't it? To be so infatuated with one man. I can't contact him ever again because I will only make it worse for him, and he deserves to move on. Well, he already did, so I don't want to ruin his progress in healing, that would be selfish.
This and other thing, but mostly being given up on by someone I love so much, was the breaking point for me. The loneliness, not having anyone close irl to talk to, not being able to vent to him anymore like we used to, it hurts being abandoned again and again.. I don't know when or if I will commit suicide. But the symptoms, the feelings, the signs are all there.
I'm just writing this here because I can't tell him. It would be wrong and abusive. Even though I want to beg for his support at least, if not him coming back to me, I won't. Even if it kills me.

"Overwhelmed and need advice I thought I was over the whole 'severe depression' thing, I always think I'm over it. I'm on antidepressants and antianxiety meds and can function well...until I can't and I take a dive. 
I just had my 36 bday and historically, I get depressed every year bc I know how much I haven't achieved. Not married, no kids, not in a job in my field of study.
My mom is the most important person to me, and the reason I'm around. She has cancer, had a masectomy within 3 weeks of finding it, and now is refusing chemo bc she's ""older and doesn't want to spend the rest of her life sick"" (she is 62) this gives the cancer a 1/3 chance to come back in 5 years.
I have a job I like with people I like to work with, but my absences are starting to go noticed. They know my mom is sick, they don't know I have chronic illnesses (early onset osteoarthritis, migraines, tmj, etc). I'm in pain every day as in not a day goes by where I'm pain-free. I get used to it until a flare pops up and takes me out. 3 or 4 of these usually make me lose my job. 
I didn't come here to complain. I'm aware a lot of people are in more pain than me, or have already lost their mom, or have no job, and while I'm grateful for what I have, I'm exhausted for always having to put on a fake persona of a clown, happy, stupid, comical, while inside I'm on fire, while on breaks I cry in my car, while I have ideations I shouldn't have but can't get rid of. 
For my mom, I would never do anything, but I feel like I'm a gear that just keeps spinning, keeps working despite grinding myself down to nothing. 
I'm anxious all day every day with a resting hr of 92 either from pain or fear: losing my mom, losing my job and therefore my freedom and my home, losing myself in the act that's not me.
As I said, I'm already on antidepressants and antianxiety meds that I take religiously at the same time each night. I'm currently at home on my last sick day bc I just can't handle getting up. I've had a migraine for two days complete with dizziness and neck pain. 
Is there anything else I can do? Is there any form of comfort I haven't already listed?

"Lifestyle issues..(mostly venting but advice would be heavily appreciated) I (16) think I'm slowly killing myself by living the way I do but I cant stop. I've been mostly at home for the past 5 nearing 6 years and I am homeschooled due to severe bullying. I'm extremely introverted/scared of social interaction, I don't work out, I don't go outside unless I absolutely have to, my diet isnt good, I smoke, I'm around people that aren't entirely good for me. 

Lately I've been slipping mental health wise, I've been extremely depressed and irritable and have been even getting suicidal thoughts or thoughts about hurting myself again after I spent a year trying to get better. My family doesn't want to believe that I have depression even if I've been prescribed medication for it. They keep denying it and saying I'm ""Just fine"" when no one my age lives this way. 

Not to mention, I haven't been feeling the best physically either due to it, I developed hypertension and nervous system issues over the past 2 years. 

I want to get better but I'm horrified of going to therapy because for one, being mentally ill and talking about it/going to therapy is taboo where i live and I also don't know how to voice any of my issues in a way that ""normal"" people understand, let alone in my native language. 

Any advice on how to motivate myself to go to therapy would be appreciated.",depression
"I don’t know if I want to keep going TW for mentions of bullying, SA, chronic illness, attempting

I’ve never had a calm and normal life. Affection from my parents was non-existent, emotionally unstable dad and narcissistic mother. Got bullied from kindergarten until high school, from physical beatings to sexual harassment everything. Got SA’d at ages 4 and 16, but I don’t even know if they count as SA since no PIV happened (fingers). At 13 I attempted, but my mom got home earlier than usual so I panicked and spit the meds out. She doesn’t know to this day.

I thought I could move on from these, but here comes the part that destroys me the most. I’ve been chronically ill most of my life. Started out at 8 years old with Hashimoto’s (autoimmune thyroid). I thought it should be fine, everything hurts and I’m exhausted all the time but it’s the weaker one of the autoimmune diseases, right?

It keeps going. Last 2 years are hell on earth, I keep losing balance, limbs randomly stop working, I feel like I’m being crushed to death. But I push through, have to finish that Bachelor’s! I did it, but then the diagnosis came after I nearly went blind in one eye. Multiple Sclerosis.

Not even 2 months later, now, I get a message from my specialist about the ANA testing we did a while ago for the insurance company. She tells me that I have to see a rheumatologist as I have every single antibody for Lupus.

I can’t do this anymore, I can’t keep it together. I have a few good friends and an amazing boyfriend, despite being together only 6 months and him seeing all this shit, he still wants to stay. But what if I destroy him and his future? I wanted kids so fucking bad but with all these it would clearly be selfish, I don’t want to pass on my horrible genes filled with diseases.

I’ve been unemployed for almost 4 months now so I’m useless, in my country mental health is not a thing so I can’t seek out any help. But not like I have money for it.

Sorry if this is messy, my mind is a fog and I can barely breathe from crying the past few hours. But I had to get this off my chest. Hopefully the people who know me never see this but if they do… I’m sorry.",depression

The election results have hit me very hard. My social media feeds are heavily political and I'm surrounded by MAGA. I have deactivated my facebook and I'm purging subscriptions to political youtube channels, but I'm still hit with random prolonged bouts of despair.

I'm having a really hard time with coping. I graduated college into the great recession, my wages have been stagnated my entire career. In 2020 I got a much better unionized government job...then COVID happened. Now this, and its only going to get worse.

"IM EXHAUSTED AND I JS WANNA END IT I’m so fucking tired of everything. I feel like I’m stuck in this constant loop, always uncovering my traumas over and over again, and it’s just exhausting. I keep falling into this depression and feeling like I’m never going to get out of it, no matter how hard I try. And now, I’m just numb. I can’t even feel the things I used to care about anymore. I try to keep pushing forward, but the weight of it all is suffocating, and it never ends. It’s like a never-ending cycle of exhaustion and emotional pain that I can’t escape from. Every time I think I’m out of it, it pulls me right back in. I keep telling myself to keep fighting, but it’s getting harder to see the point. And what’s worse is that no one around me understands. My mom, my best friend, they don’t see it, or they don’t get it. No one sees the real me, and it just makes everything feel more isolating. It’s like I’m invisible, like I don’t matter, even though I’m dying inside. Every time I try to talk, it feels like I’m talking to a wall, and it just gets worse. I keep waiting for someone to see me, to understand me, but all I get is silence. And honestly, I feel like maybe it’s me, maybe I’m the one who’s the problem, but I can’t seem to get out of this dark place. It feels like I’m trapped in my own mind, and it’s killing me. And on top of all that, I’ve had to deal with a narcissistic ex who left me with trauma, and my mom, who’s been equally selfish and dismissive, emotionally unavailable. I’ve been to a psychiatrist, but it doesn’t feel like anyone really gets me. I feel like I’ve tried everything, but no matter how hard I try, I can’t shake this feeling of being misunderstood and alone. When I went to the psychiatrist, I opened up about my trauma, about being manipulatively sexualized, about what I went through, but he didn’t even acknowledge it. He didn’t say a word about it, and I don’t understand why. It’s like my pain didn’t matter. I felt so dismissed, like nothing I said mattered. I just don’t know why it felt so... empty. And for some reason, I still find myself being nice to my ex when he reaches out for a chat, even though I don’t want to. I’m tired of it, and I’m angry at myself for allowing it. But it’s like the anger and frustration keep building up, and I just can’t get out of this cycle. I’m exhausted, and the numbness from all the times I’ve fallen into depression is just weighing on me. I’m so tired of all of this, and the worst part is, my mom never even cared enough to check if I was seeing a therapist. She doesn’t even know I’ve gone to therapy because I did it all by myself. I didn’t expect anyone to care anyway, and I guess I was right. And when I went to the psychiatrist, I tried to explain, but he just brushed it off.

He didn’t get it at all, and now, I'm left with this. It’s like no one’s ever really there for me, and I’m just stuck in this horrible loop. I’m so fucking exhausted, and honestly, I just want to end it. I feel so fucking misunderstood and just trapped in my own body. I don’t see myself anymore .I just see someone who's been through so much trauma, and there's a part of me that just wants to escape. But there’s no one who understands me.

"I’m so tired.  Every day I truly do try to wake up and make the best of it. I just don’t know how much more I have in me. 

I’ve realized I’ve isolated myself from most of my friends. I have poor eating habits. I’m having some relationship issues with my boyfriend. My job is a complete joke and I am struggling with money. I’ve not finished college. It’s getting hard at this point to even get out of bed and get dressed everyday. 

I’m just so fucking tired of it feeling like nothing is ever going to get better. I try SO hard to just make it through every day and I really just feel my will to do that giving out. I don’t know what else to do anymore. I’m just really tired, really lonely, and bone-achingly sad. I can’t do more pills and more therapy. I’m just exhausted and want to be done with it all.

I wish I could just restart my life. ",depression
"I'm tired hi, i dont really have much to say, other than im feeling tired. im feeling alone. avoiding my friends and avoiding my family. 

I work from home, so im not even leaving house. thankfully im not falling into the self-harm traps and wishing of dying, but the feeling of isolation is just eating me up. it's an endless cycle, im tired so i dont go out, which makes me more isolated, which makes me more tired. 

despite being in my mid 20s, my parents still treat me like the girl child. they dont visit often, but when they do, i try my best to not show anything, but im really uncomfortable and just want to be left alone

"When should a person go to a psychiatric hospital? So about a week ago I started a new anti depressant. It made me very sick, like to the point where I was shaking, drenched in sweat, diarrhea, and having panic attacks. I was also feeling very depressed and suicidal. I almost called an ambulance but was able to make it to the hospital on my own. My dr switched my medication and today the same thing happened. I had to stop working because I felt the same symptoms and started dry heaving until I took a sip of water and threw up. I checked my bp using the machine in the break room and it was 142/81 and my heart rate was 112, so I left and went to urgent treatment. 

Now I’m contemplating on if I should go to psychiatric in patient or not. I’m to the point where I’m terrified of taking another new antidepressant. I also can’t keep leaving work early because of a reaction to my medication. Personally I would like to take an fmla leave until I can get my medication figured out, however I’m not qualified because I haven’t been at my current job for 12 months. I feel like going in patient would be good because they could try different medications and I’d be somewhere safe if something were to happen again. It’s also an excused absence from work. However, I feel like mentally I’m just not at a point where I feel like I’m a threat to myself or others. Most of the time I feel fine (still depressed but overall fine) mentally, but it’s when I’m having severe reactions to my medication that I feel like I want to die. 

If anyone could help point me in the right direction, I would be very appreciative. Thank you for reading my yap session.

"Why I’m depressed  1. My mother has been constantly in and out of hospital for 2 years now. She was diagnosed with breast cancer back in 2023 and although she’s clear now, my family have a long history of cancer. Both my grandmas had cancer, my uncle has been diagnosed with cancer recently (I think not too sure on details but my family never tell me anything) my grandmas sister died of cancer before my grandma was even born (she died at 2 years old of cancer). Basically what I’m saying is that because there’s such a long history of cancer my mother had an operation to have her ovaries removed so she wouldn’t be at risk of cervical cancer. Also not to mention me and my sister are potentially very screwed over as we’ve come to the conclusion we could be at higher rush of getting cancer. 
 2. My family is literally falling apart around me and I’ve left most of the people I know clueless. I live in two different places (my friends mostly don’t know), parents are divorced (again friends don’t know), my mum quote literally has a boyfriend and two children (daughters slightly older than my sister who’s 18). My sister won’t make any efforts to get to know these people so I’m on my own again trying to make myself likeable for a family I don’t even care about.
4. Exams, too many exams that I have 0 confidence in as I’m definitely not an academic weapon and executive dysfunction is my worst enemy at the moment.
5. Intrusive thoughts that are so bad. Every 5 minutes my brain is telling me stuff that just isn’t true of telling me If I don’t do a certain action e.g. tap a pen 3 times I’m going to fail these exams.
5. I can’t end it because I’d make people sad (I wish it didn’t though) and also I don’t want to traumatise my parents because they’ve been through enough. My mum lost her dad at 21 and my dad lost his father at 15. My Grandma (mothers;mother) has severe dementia and my mother just seems to be loosing it a lot.",depression

It's been really bad, They have been trying my best to just push through it and until the summer when I finally can leave because my dad's taking full custody of me, shit I'm not even 18, When I was younger I wanted to be somebody impretend and I wanted to help the world.

Nothing intrests me, I don't enjoy anything (though I understand I need to keep on so I do basic things and even keep on some hobbies).

"Spiraling Nobody cares about me as much as I do about them. The father of my child is a complete douchebag manipulative narcissistic piece of shit that adds an immeasurable amount of stress to my life. I feel like he ripped away my chance at freedom from my life of neglect, I got pregnant at 20. I was a virgin, never had a relationship before that. I understand that I was an adult, but I am neurodivergent and I can’t help but feel like he somehow still groomed me. Used me. Manipulated me for three years before I finally called it quits. There is so much more about him that I could type out but I just don’t have the energy. 

I’ve been depressed and suicidal as long as I can remember. Unloved and neglected by my family. Unhealthy, obese starting from a toddler because my parents didn’t give enough of a shit to try to change it. My sister tormented me until she moved away when I was 13, but the damage she did had already left many scars on my brain. And it still has. Sure I am kind and loving, more intelligent and open minded than most people nowadays. But what is any of that worth if I feel so constantly alone and invisible? I can’t leave my daughter in this world by herself, but sometimes that just makes me feel like she’s an anchor. I could never leave her to suffer the mental manipulation her father is capable of. I couldn’t. I love her so much but I am finding myself wishing more and more that I had never met her father. None of it is her fault either, she is a beautiful and happy, very intelligent little girl. 

I’m so pathetic. I try, I try so fucking hard to keep myself motivated, I quit everything I could think of that would affect my brain negatively. Weed, nicotine, sugar, caffeine, alcohol, and other occasional substances. Maybe it’s just withdrawal symptoms but maybe not, because I’m no stranger to these thoughts. 

I am so bored with life. I’m so exhausted from just waking up in the morning, from having to move to appease my basic bodily needs. I wish something would end my life so that I don’t have to. I won’t, I never will. But this life is looking like a long, torturously unhappy life and I’m just left wondering why? Why me? Why couldn’t I have been someone born to a stable home, where I had a place to grow up and have roots? Instead I have had to move nearly every 18 months growing up, like clockwork. And since I have had my child, I haven’t stayed in one place longer than 6-8 months. I can’t even afford childcare to work full-time. Don’t even get me started on the actual idiocy of that vicious loop, not being able to work because I don’t have childcare, not being able to afford it because I can’t work for the money. 

I’m tired of feeling hopeless, helpless, worthless. I just want to be happy. Why is it so much to ask for?",depression
"Hi everyone, this is my only hope to share my problem a little, and I hope I can get some support.  I’m 21 years old, and this past year has been a disaster for me. At the beginning of the year, I had a good job, a partner, and everything was going well... But in February, my health fell apart, and I ended up in the hospital. A few days after I got out of the hospital, I went back to work, but they fired me. My health kept getting worse until May (stomach and digestive issues), and I wasn’t able to work. Since then, it’s improved a bit.

But what I can’t bear is... I live in Hungary, in a rough area. I have no job opportunities. I’ve submitted my resume to 27 places, but I haven’t heard anything since August. Every day, stress has built up inside me. This whole year, I’ve been surviving on small amounts of money that I could earn through small jobs. Over the past month and a half, I haven’t been able to see my girlfriend or my friends. I’ve been at home 24/7 for weeks, alone with my thoughts.

I have so many negative thoughts that I even reached out to family and friends for support, but I didn’t get anything from them. Mentally, I’m getting worse and worse because I can’t see a way to have a good life. I broke up with my girlfriend because I was feeling so low and didn’t feel I was getting any attention or support from her, which was my biggest mistake. I still love her, and I’m completely broken because she’s totally turned away from me.

Right now... I don’t have a job, I don’t have a girlfriend, I don’t have friends, no one talks to me, I just lie here quietly with my negative thoughts—it’s been two weeks of this now... I feel useless in life; I’ve failed, and for the first time in my life, I need help and I haven’t gotten it from anyone. I’m not doing well mentally, and every day it gets worse... My health is declining too, I can’t sleep because I just can’t, I’m not hungry, and when I do eat, I immediately end up in the bathroom. I wake up at night feeling short of breath. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Is there a way out of this? How can I try to explain to someone close to me that I really need mental support? I feel so lost...

"helping friend with mental health issues is driving me crazy and theres no escape I’ve been dealing with persistent anger issues for a while now, and it’s starting to feel unbearable. It’s especially intense when I think about a close ffriend of mine who has mental health issues and is constantly crying and complaining about shit nad never bothers to make a change. he has CPTSD, social anxiety and bit of bpd and used to have depression. he is constantly moaning and complaining and he finally started to make a change to improve his confidence and on day 3 of his confidence plan he kept moaning about how he'll be awkward awkward awkward he kept repeating that in my fucking ear awakward awkward and how he'll never be confident but he never fucking tries and he always find shit to rant about like how people dont respond positivley to whats hes saying but i've told him he needs to put in the effort to be more popular he understood that but he still fucking drives me craazy. i've set boundaries and everthing but i still get reminders of the memories. i just woke up at 6am to have an anger outburst. it triggers something in me. I get this strong urge to punch something or scream, and it makes me really anxious, almost like I can’t escape this feeling.

I’ve tried everything I can think of to manage this anger. I’ve done things like deep breathing, journaling, and even exercising. I’ve had some small successes, but nothing seems to work long-term. The anger comes back, especially when I see my friend getting upset or feeling hopeless. i'd rather have no friends then a mentally ill crying and complaining one. i've been ""there for him"" and he says hes grateful but that means i have to deal with him

i can't escape from this guy until hes somewhat better as i see him in many classes and he'll always find the oppurtunity. i'm gonna recommend him to see a GP to get meds as thats his last hope because he's too moanining and complaining to get confidence the hard way and didnt wanna do EMDR therapy because he said ""why do i have to remember when my life was shit"" even though his ptsd was from bullying and a can of £5 pepper spray can be easily used against a bully

Has anyone else dealt with something similar? How did you manage anger in a situation like this, where you care about someone but their struggles are affecting your mental health? I’d really appreciate any advice or strategies that have worked for you.",depression

I'm scared to die, I love him, but I'm a trouble for both of us, I guess the only way out is suicide. I don't want to leave...I could have a good life,but it's so painful, why I have to suffer this?

My heart hurts so bad now, I need to get up,I need to study,I need to make a progress,I'm so scared...so afraid...so anxious.I don't know how to defeat this nightmare, I used to be a happy person...this is not me, I don't know... :(

"Goo Goo Dolls verse that hits close And I was in love with the things I tried to make you believe I was
And I wouldn't be the one to kneel before the dreams I wanted
When all the dark and all the lies were all the empty things disguised as me.

In a poetic way this verse sums up the personal interactions of my adult life.  This inability of mine to let people in to get to know the real me.  Only in the last years have I come to see that it was always a mentality issue.  A mental state.  For decades I tried physical remedies.  Get out more.  Relationships. Hobbies.  Education.  Networking.  And while all these things are positive on their own the issue at hand was always inside me.  Some wise quote goes ""a man who can't control himself will always be a slave"".  I made a slave out of myself by overguarding my ego from all the judgements of reality.  I couldn't tell you why I'm this way.  It's just always been since I can remember.  I was a child who lived in his thoughts and I became an adult who retreated to his thoughts whenever he could.   Nature or nurture?  These are just my thoughts into the void. ",depression

I literally can’t  I hate living like this. I’ve been depressed since I was a kid bc I kept getting bullied and sexually assaulted. I always felt empty and chased the feeling of happiness. I didn’t do anything super destructive like drugs and alcohol until now but I dissociated often. I’ve been at a mental decline for months now before I could self regulate and be happy for months at a time but it’s hard when you are constantly shot while trying to get up. For starters I lost my boyfriend which sucks but who cares then I found out I have stage 4 endometriosis and can’t have kids. Ive been experiencing pain associated with that since I was 10. Then I found out I wasn’t going to have a job because they weren’t accepting transfers 4 weeks before I was moving 3 hours away. It took me 1 month to find a job and it doesn’t pay anything close to what I was making before. I pay for my college as well as my rent with no help bc I’m not eligible for fafsa or any aid bc my mom claimed me. I’ve been here since Aug and I haven’t made any friends and Im really into manifesting and had good results before but that has really let me down. I’m running out of money and i probably will have to drop out soon bc I have to choose between school or a place to stay. My old friends never reach out and I always have to which makes me feel like shit. I want to get help and talk to someone bc i really don’t see the point in living and never really have. It sucks when you don’t really even need much just friends and money and I can’t even get that. I always feel like I am a burden to people when I asked for help bc I get treated that way. I bring up anything and it’s pls don’t do this again bc I tried to kill myself when I was 12 because I was heavily getting sexually assaulted and bullied at school and by family. And plus who wants to hang out with a depressed person. I pretend to be happy and force myself to see the positive in everything and self regulate but it isn’t working anymore. I can’t keep pretending when nothing is improving. I’ll just cry every night and wish my life would change for the better. I don’t feel like I’m personally a burden or ugly or worthless bc I’m not but I can’t live like this anymore. I want my life to be worth living and it isn’t and barely ever feels that way.,depression
"I don't think it gets better. I am a 40 year old woman, mother, and otherwise failure at life. I struggle with ADHD and being an otherwise awkward human. I've lost more jobs than I can count on one hand and now I can't even find a new one. It seems my luck has run out.

My kids keep me alive. I don't want them to think it's their fault I killed myself. That's not fair to them. But I'm trying, so hard, to just be dead while alive. It's hard, though, as I need a job. I figure if I can stop wanting anything (attention, love, to be attractive, special, smart, successful, etc) then maybe I can just manage to exist without offending existence.

Every day I apply to jobs, especially the days I have interviews knowing I won't get the role, is the hardest. All the jobs need experience I don't have and I can't get that experience without getting the job. Now that I'm 40, it's too late to get the experience. I live in a very HCOL area and my husband refuses to move. He makes ok money but without benefits and we just can't afford life here without dipping into savings. I need a job.

I've been applying to jobs that pay 25% of what I was making in the past. No one understands I can't get another job again. I am unemployable. I failed at those jobs and no one wants me.

"ADHD, Depression, Alcohol - what a great mix this is Hi guys. First time I am really telling anyone about this, so why not to total strangers in the internet. I suffer from periods of pretty bad depression. I feel lost, like no one cares about me, including myself. They usually start with an argument or just something, my wife or someone would say. Sometimes from my self talk as well. Like many, I get bad suicidal thoughts right away when that happens. Funny thing is that I got my life pretty much in order. I got a wife, 2 great kids (teens now), pets, a great house by the sea (I live in New Zealand) and I am set financially for retirement due to a lucky gig I scored with my IT company. That all does not make me happy, though. I tried my whole live to change external factors. I moved to different continents 3 times, started new hobby’s, bought more toys but I kinda always knew that happiness is within myself. I was just never able to find it. I started drinking at an early age and got pretty good at it. I am not shy anyway but when I am drinking, I am really funny. So everyone likes drunk me but no one knows the real one. I am am no alcoholic but I am a drunk. When I am going out, I chose the place by the drinks I get there and all I do with my friends is drinking. I obviously understand that this is a problem but if I would stop, I just don’t know what else there is. I tried meditation, read all those books, established great habits just to fall back to my own ways after a few months. I can start anything and become pretty good fast but then I lose interest - that I suppose is a sign for ADHD though I never had anything diagnosed. I know, this is something a lot of people suffer from. I just wonder what to do. I am 50 now and would like to have a few truely happy years before I go. I know this is vague but I’d be thankful for any advice about where to start to achieve real, long term change.",depression

"Depressed but being told I have an eating disorder Hi I'm 30 (F), I've been dealing with depression since 2021. I live in Toronto, Canada. I went to CAMH in 2021 after having a hard year and was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. It hasn't gotten better since so I went to a psychiatrist. Mind you during this time I have lost a lot of weight, but I've always been a fairly skinny girl with a fast metabolism, so when I lose weight it looks bad but it's not intentional. The psychiatrist after letting him know my eating habits (letting him know I do try to gain weight I just don't do as much as I should due to me not being able to get out of bed. At the end of all that he diagnosed me with an eating disorder. I was shocked I've never thought I had one nor do I think I do at the moment. Obviously he's a doctor and knows his stuff but I know my body and mind and it's so frustrating as a young woman in Canada trying to get mental health help because it feels like nobody is listening.

"I don’t know if I can even label this as depression I get into these moods where I just don’t care. Things that normally DO matter to me, suddenly don’t. It happens every once in a while for maybe a week or two. It’s not a full blown depressive episode, but It’s like all of my motivation and excitement is drained from my body. Things that used to make me happy, suddenly don’t for a while. I just feel like nothing matters.

But on the flip side, things that normally make me sad, suddenly don’t anymore. I don’t cry at sad movies, I don’t get angry, I don’t get frustrated. I just feel like those things don’t matter.

I’m in therapy, but I’m not on any meds. I just feel like I’m in this weird gray area. I miss feeling excited. And to an extent, I miss feeling frustrated….at least I wouldn’t feel so off. I’d rather be angry than numb.

"Cycles of slight function to no function in college. Hello. I've struggled with depression beginning senior year of high school and it hit full force-- I barely attended classes but still passed easily because we are a small school and people never fail. I made it into a college with almost a full ride and I achieved that once I talked to financial aid. 

I feel like I should be happier about this but truthfully I feel like I'm wasting it. 

In the course of the first 3 weeks I missed multiple classes well over 5 times resulting in a meeting to discuss my mental health, but I made an excuse about not having an alarm to wake up. After this it got better after I *did* get an alarm to wake up but after about a week I would start getting up and turning the alarm off and going back to sleep. I don't do any homework (essentially) but maintain a social life even though for a good portion of the week I never appear on campus because I'm sleeping. 

I've requested a counselor, in itself a massive step because I am generally incapable of asking for help or assistance on any matter, especially mental health.  I like to think that the state of the country is what consistently gets me down, but I'm not exactly at risk for my lifestyle to change because of the election, as I'm a cishet white male.

Pains come and go in the chest, my mind often seeks emptiness over fullness. I had a phase with DPH which I enjoyed specifically because it made my head emptier, almost like I was dreaming. Thankfully I stopped, but it is scary that the only reason I *did* was because I do not have any money, at all. This applies to all my previous drugs, cannabis, nicotine, alcohol, etc. If I had money, I would be using them intensively as I did in my senior year. 

I try not to show this side of me in public but the beginning of college marked a major transformation in my person (I *was* arrogant, talkative, and now I don't generally talk in class, and I don't exactly see myself as a good person anymore), and I think it's helped me ""show"" this side of me in public, but I fear it isn't enough.

People assume I'm lazy or otherwise, but it feels as though I physically can't do work-- I try and the headspace just isn't there. I don't know how else to describe it. It's like trying to move a muscle you don't have. ",depression

"For anyone interested in reading/vent 29/F

Long story short upbringing childhood is, I’ve had major depression since as long as I can remember. I didn’t enjoy things like a normal kid, my parents spoiled me, I’ve gone on many vacations, I’ve been given many opportunities to be great. I love to sing, play tennis. Went to catholic school, was bullied there for about 8 years. I always had 1 friend for a very long time (10-15 years) I never liked groups. I would say I’m attractive, but not skinny rich girl attractive. It dawned on me today that I’ve never felt free to be at max happy. I never feel free enough to dance.

My parents and I don’t have a great relationship. My mother has even said I didn’t turn out the way she meant, and guilts me. My dad has mental issues and is a clepto amongst other weird shit.

I would say I don’t hate my personality, can definitely put on a face to be social. I’ve never been happy, but I’ve justified that by understanding every emotion is fleeting. I’ve read a ton of self help books, love to exercise, be outside. Yet, I’m always never a full person, and I can feel that ceiling. 

As far as therapy goes; I’ve had multiple in my life, forced and not forced. Tried meds. But I don’t want to gain weight, and I’ve always convinced myself it’s better to not take meds. 

I have isolated the things i do that depression might make do. Push people away, hide, lash out. I know I’m loved, and I have wonderful people I love. I hate to work and want to quit every job. I’m older now, and not having a career or full education is a large part of my sadness. That typical stuff. But it’s come to the point where I’m so tired of trying to be better and stable. I’m lashing out at strangers, which is completely out of character for me. For reference, Idgaf about small talk. I understand why it’s important to a degree. But again, I am incredibly tired of pretending that I care about a hello from a strangers

Another add is: I got into a car accident in January and got a hole in my leg basically. It got infected, and I can’t even can run like i enjoy doing. And gained weight. 

Anyway the point of this is to say, I have a new symptom of this after a lifetime of ups and downs and apathy. Which is basically just being mute and staring at a wall. Or just straight up dissociating and not being able to come out of it as easy now. I started this new job, and I don’t talk to anyone. If I do, I feel like a robot. Not fitting in with the culture here. I ignore my family. And talk when I feel it seems right to do so, for being a human-sake and knowing we need to. And there are times or weeks where I really love to say hi. I’ve come to a point where I’m worried Ive gone down a hole of just existing and have gotten worse, when I don’t feel as bad as I have in the past. ",depression
"I'm so tired (Sorry for poor grammar I can't really think well atm)

I wouldn't say I have it as bad as some of the other people that have told their story on this subreddit but by no means am I alright.

I'm just a normal dude, 20 years old, I study, I game, I hang out with friends just like any normal dude would. I act nonchalantly around people and act as if all my problems would solve by themselves, but I worry. I worry all the time, whether it be big or small, the last thing I've achieved was my high school certificate 4 years ago. I've done nothing after it and I am currently at my lowest point ever. Every night I wonder if things truly get better even when I think of just committing suicide to make all of my problems disappear. 

I do know that I need help and I'm currently following therapy in order to come out as a stronger person, but as of right now I don't see the benefits at all. There are so many things I want to achieve but I just know I can't, because that's who I am. A guy who says a lot but never shows the work. Only my family and some friends know about my situation and I'm surrounded by good people but I just feel so fucking empty all the time. I also never experienced love with a girl due to my looks, I wouldn't say I'm that ugly but I'm just average and slightly overweight. I always thought some romance I my life could make it better, but now I just think I'd make my future partner crazy if I were to tell her all this.

Every now and then when I'm thinking about how shitty my life is suicide seems to cross my mind more and more, although I never really go further than that I still silently cry because I was like: ""What the fuck was I thinking? There's people who want me to succeed and to laugh"". But I just can't do it anymore. I'm tired and I feel like nothing is helping, at this point it's just a coinflip whether I wake up happy or depressed. I've also never really vented on the internet before so that's a first. It's gone so far that I made a fresh account just so I can evade my friends that follow me on my main account. I sincerely think that I'll be dead in the next 5 years, I don't care if it's a war, or I get killed, or I commit suicide. I just know I won't make it past 25.

"How to cope I’m not sure where else to write about this. But depression feels like something is constantly pushing against your will to live, to be productive, to be positive, to be happy. In all senses and all endeavours. It doesn’t matter if you realize this, because it’s pervasive and incessantly constant.

"I want to curl up in a ball and die even though all I want to do is live I want to curl up in a ball and die even though all I want to do is live, more than anymore in my life. I'm facing a severe depressive episode.

I moved from my original home in Saudi Arabia as a young woman (for college) and moved to Canada. I grew up in a traditional Pakistani household. In no means was I ever meant to be the way I was raised. I developed a deep interest in looking beyond what I was taught, I became to my family, a very disturbed teenager to then just sucking up and being myself when I was alone but having a whole facade of what my family wanted out of me on the outside. The only reason being; it was the only way I was able to leave the country and be my own. I am grateful I had a roof over my head, never had to worry about my food, and my dad works his ass off to provide for us as there was no life to live in my home country; especially for our family. Despite having financial support in my life (my father continues to pay for my housing and tuition to continue to live here), everything else was never great. I faced physical, mental, emotional, verbal and sexual abuse at the hands of my family. They provided me with all the things I wanted, but not the secure love, but they were trying. They still try. But they also try to rid me of everything I am. Shame. That's the unfortunate feeling I walked away with. A ridiculous amount of guilt and shame. I was not allowed to be outside alone, never allowed to see friends or hang out with me until I was around 17, never allowed to be my own. I succumbed, cause I feel like I have a privilege no one else in my life has had. 

All of this, but I struggled with my mental health my whole life. Ever since I was a kid. The abuse made it worse (or caused it, I can't remember, I just remember feeling sad and then getting beat or verbally told off and just wanting to dissappear). Somehow, I still managed, despite very private severe depressive episode and suicide attempts/self harm. I remember one day my mom saw my wrist, found out, she was very angry with me. She would later remind me of it in future sessions of outbursts when she would get upset at me for just about anything. I will always remember her telling me she wished I had cut deeper. I know she didn't mean it, she has been through a lot, and there was always an undertone of almost a mutual understanding, looking back on it. Not necessarily her being kind and understanding, but I see in her eyes a young girl suffering like I do. I was also struggling with severe physical health problems. I would try to tell my family, they wouldn't listen. These health issues have been reoccurring in my life ever since, though I don't let it get as bad as I was before. I remember getting blood work done and my hemoglobin was at a 3.7 (I don't know the units but according to them it was supposed to be at a 9). The doctor was taken aback and had asked me how I was managing on a day to day doing school and everything. I don't know. I don't remember much. It was all a blur of late night breakdowns and struggling to sleep for days on end. 

Fast forward to now. I moved away to Canada, and my first year here started off in a positive outlook. Then I had a depressive episode again, then I picked it up and decided to completely change my life. I started doing MMA (something I was always passionate about) twice a day, training, cooking, pursuing my degree and doing well at it, and also maintaining all my hobbies. I also had a knack for organisation, keeping my house in tip top shape. I was living in dorms at the time. I had a roommate and she definitely noticed my depressive episodes, too. She was kind, but I was uncomfortable living with a stranger. I couldn't handle it. It pushed me to stay in my room more and later down the line, I would move away from campus with the support of my family as I told them how tough it was for me to have to live with someone. I feel like a brat. Then, it came again. I got hit with a depressive episode because I started to learn so much about mental health, as I was also going to counseling and seeing a physician for my depression. I got diagnosed with very severe ADHD and they believe I have some sort of clinical depression, anxiety, as well as something OCD related and they also think I might be on the spectrum. I was not shocked, I always knew there was something wrong with me. I started medication for mental illness and that is definitely a whole story on its own. I would take my medication on and off at the time.

The memories I had pushed away, current events that were occurring in my life (struggling with a semi-abusive relationship, all the normal young adult stuff probably) all of it just hit me. The final straw, my physical health went backwards again. I was still energetic though, but I had stopped going to MMA, I was hiking a lot, too. Canada is a beautiful country. Then I couldn't anymore. I got too physically and mentally weak. I continued to get help for both medically and on and off counseling (I was struggling to make it to appointments). Throughout this, it was well past my first semester in university. I was failing. Badly. I have continued to fail, to this very point. My transcript is all withdrawals with an acceptable grade here and there.

 I couldn't tell my parents, I still can't. My father paid for those courses. All that money, I wasted. I didn't also have a choice as I am legally obligated to be in school to abide by my study permit,  and it was my only way to stay in this country. I couldn't do anything else because my family made it very straight to the point that if I don't do this then I must return home and just live with them until I get married. They wanted me to be a doctor, and though I loved Biology, during this time I learned I didn't want to be a doctor or any of that, and I did love Biology but I loved the evolution side of it more. I learned I loved ancient history, and I switched over to anthropology. I fell in love. It's my passion alongside history in general. I couldn't tell my family about my degree. They would hate me. They would think I'm failure. So I have to lie about everything. Lie that I'm doing great, that I'm going to be a doctor, that I'm in university, that I'm going to be exactly what they want. If I don't, they will stop funding me. I have no other choice, I never had a choice to be financially independent, I lived in a country as not only a woman but a female immigrant so no one wants that in Saudi Arabia. I have a disdain to it anyway. It is filled with racism, sexism, and homophobia (I'm definitely not a straight woman, either). 

This started two years ago. I'm here today, still alive. And this depressive episode only spiraled. My home is all just rotting garbage that I don't have the energy to take out, but I've been actually trying. I've been trying and failing but still kicking but the weight of everything and just having depression has left me in rock bottom. I feel like a piece of shit disappointment spoiled bratty privileged daughter, I even dug my savings and constantly need to ask my family for money as I have no energy to make my own meals. Nor do I have the means to as my fridge makes me gag everytime I open it, my sink is full of rotting dishes, pots, pans, etc. So I order food. I can't do anything, but I have been trying little by little to see hope, yet I still breakdown and want to die in a time where I'm fighting so hard to live.

 I have also reapplied to extend my status here as a student, and considering the current political situation and understandably, an unconvincing transcript, I'm probably going to get deported or something. I don't feel like I even deserve to be here, I am in a privileged place and I have not done anything worthwhile out of it. Someone else who deserves to be here can't, while I can.

I hate myself and everything I am. I try to do things little by little as my counselor suggests, but it doesn't feel like the dawn of a new day. I feel absolutely disgusted by myself. I want to just curl up and die, but I so badly wish I could just live and live to help others. I want to be a voice of reason for many. I want to do so much, but those are just dreams. I'm afraid I'm going to lose my hard battle with depression. I don't even take any measures to hurt myself in any way. I think I'm just going to waste away until I become a shell of my former self. Then I won't be me anymore and rot away and die or do something to end it.",depression

I want to stay in my current city, i cant afford it making $20/hr. The apartment I'm looking at would be around 1,200 a month utilities included compared to an average 1,700 before utilities for one in my current city. Hell even when I do the application, when doing my work history, one of my jobs doesn't have an email. They require an email on the application. So it's just all signs I'm not ment to move forward. A glimpse of hope destroyed like it always is.",depression
"Depressed person giving a talk on resilience (Advice request) Well I have been struggling with depression, anxiety and having zero social skills. Used to be a confident, high self esteem person but faced through some adversity and I an still struggling. 

Then as per nature of my job, I gotta give a talk or more like do an activity on resilience. I spent months thinking about a topic and came up with a strategy which doesn't work for me. I gotta wing it but I also feel like I should share a bit of my story, which I don't feel comfortable at all. Talk is scheduled in next week and idk how to change now.

Pxrn  I’m a weirdo. I’m 23 and jerk off so much. I’m so perverted and have no confidence in myself as a person. I fantasize about fucking women instead of actually approaching. Who else can relate? I find my self in the same loop over and over again. ,depression

Will it get better? I'm tired of seeing others with friends while I am not being seen. I hate myself but I guess any harm to myself won't help. Hurting myself won't atttact others and anything good.

I am so depressed that they're the only people I know and closed with in my town.

What do my friends see in this pathetic excuse of a human, that I am?
Even better question: who am I, anyway?

The best I can think of as myself is a book, which has an ugly cover and doesn't have a title, only the author's name. And the pages are just empty. Blank. It has no fucking purpose, no meaning, no worth, no use. It's just a placeholder.
Also, the pages are stained in cat piss, mouse shit, mold, and vomit.

Who the fuck, in their right mind, would keep around a book like this, between their perfectly normal and enjoyable books on their bookshelf?

It serves no use, no purpose and makes your stomach turn every time you see it, so why keep it around?

I want to take that proverbial book and light in fire, torn it apart, rip out it's blank pages piece by piece. 

Don't they see how revolting my very existence is?

Why do they want to keep me around, even if I am good for nothing?

"i'm killing myself and it feels... weird? i have a cocktail of emotions inside tbh and i feel like i need to let them out somewhere. 

first, i feel relieved that it's gonna be over. it's been so long since i've been feeling this way. i've had depression/deppresive episodes since i was 11. i've had ups and downs and i know that. but honestly, right now i've been on one of my lowest lows since... well, too much time. i haven't had a night's sleep that lasted more than 5h since before summer, and i feel exhausted. i don't wanna get too personal, but honestly i feel like a pit, and i've been this way since i was a teenager. i'm a pit and everything good that comes to me falls into my darkness and it chews it and gives it to me back as an unrecognisable mess that i can't seem to appreciate. i'm ungrateful and don't know how to enjoy anything even if i know that there are good things in my life. the problem is me. and it feels peaceful to know that the only thing that is causing all of this is gonna be done soon.

on the other hand, i feel... melancholic? i know there are things i would like to do, food i would like to try, books i would like to read... it's not like i have nothing left. i feel sad that i won't get to do all the things i would've liked to do before i go. but being honest, i used to feel this way even before having a plan and a date set. the pass of time is something i've never had a good relationship with. i feel tucked by it constantly. and even if it makes me sad, at the very least that pressure is gone, since it's not like i don't know if i'll have enough time to anything - no, now i know i won't. it's a fact. and nothing that i'd like to try (or i know i would had liked to try, because as i said nothing feels exciting now) weights enough to change my decision, even if it makes me kind of sad. it's as if i was watching myself from the outside and saying ""he had so much life to live"" while knowing my destiny full well. 

and then, there are my loved ones. i feel terrible every time i talk to them. i feel like i'm lying and i feel so guilty about everything. if there's something i know to appreciate at this point in my life is that i'm not alone. i have a partner whom i love, friends that try to support me (i don't like these apparently fully distinguished terms ""friends"" and ""partner"" - i'm more of a relationship anarchist, but it's just for the sake of people who can read this to understand easily), my relationships with the biological family i have left have improved since i moved out. and i feel so sorry for them. i feel so guilty not telling them what's about to come. i feel so bad for not caring enough about them to keep going. i know they care about me and i don't want them to feel like it's their fault (i will say this on my goodbyes). they've done everything they could and even more. they just can't help me because there's no problem besides myself. and i'm really sorry that i'm making them go through this, because i know for a lot of them it's not a good time right now either. 

i'm also scared of surviving. i don't think i can handle the days after an attempt. all those worried sights that try to hide themselves behind a try-to-be-friendly-and-suppotive smile. everyone knowing what you did while no one saying it out loud. everyone carefully choosing their words and actions around you, scared at the possibility of triggering you. the feeling of failure, pitifulness and guilt that comes with it. and not knowing what to do afterwards. i think that my fear of not being successful is one of the things that make me so determined about this being the time i finally do it. 

idk man. i've had suicide attempts before, but being honest nothing has felt more determined than this. it's almost as if i was watching these last days of my life with no agency to save myself - the decision is taken and i can't do anything about it at this point. ",depression

"How do I get over a really self destructive addiction that I haven't told anyone about? For some context, I'm a 14 year old male. I've really been struggling with suicidal thoughts lately (And have made plans with the intention of going through with them 3 times.) Nothing was really working to calm myself down with the exception of music. I discovered recently that by duct taping my mouth shut, putting on a sleeping mask, wearing headphones, and then slipping a garbage bag over my head numbs my pain. The feeling of asphyxiation and complete darkness puts me in a strange state of calmness. I usually take off the bag and duct tape when I start having violent spasms. I've timed and recorded myself before. The spasms usually start after 6-10 minutes.

When I put on the bag, I feel numb. But not painful mental numbness that I've become far too familiar with. When I don't have the bag on, all my thoughts are negative. I feel like I don't deserve to live, I feel intense feelings of self hatred, I feel really lonely, and I feel urges to hurt myself or kill myself. I also have constant panic attacks. When I put on the bag, my mind clears and I'm in a strange between-awake-and-asleep feeling. It just feels good. I realize now that I'm becoming addicted to this sensation. I do it every time I'm alone.

I recognize that I need help, but In a strange way I don't desire to get better. Everyone feels sad. Not being sad would just be fake. What's the meaning of living without pain? And I don't really view myself with enough value to go through the trouble of trying to stop. It helps, and I'm already planning on killing myself. I don't see much of a point.",depression

They don’t need me to be someone drowning in their own self-pity that they need to come and pick up when they have their own lives to lead. I never wanted to be that person that they have to be on call for at all hours of the day. I want to fade in and out of existence at will- hide myself away until I can come back to my senses and be the person I need to be. My loved ones don’t need me to be a drag but at the same time, I know the alternative is taking myself out which would break them.

"Parent's unconditional love for their children How much do you think mothers love their children?
If she comes to know her child is cheating her since years. Even though he knows that his parents are suffering a lot, he continues to lie and cheat them. He knows his parents eat less food just so they can afford to pay his education fees but still the child plays games, watches movies and series whole day and doesn't study at all. When asked, he says he is studying. He makes false promises he will study and asks them to buy him a Samsung tablet which is way more expensive than what they can afford. Parents believing the child, buys it and child studies for a while and then again he continues watching movies and series, this time more than before since it's a big screen than his mobile on which he used to watch earlier. When results come, he doesn't lie about them but tells them he failed and blames it all on his memory power, exam difficulty level & luck. Sometimes he accepts he didn't study enough but doesn't say he was watching movies, he instead blames it on his poor health and sleep cycle. And the most important thing he is studying medicine so he is going to be a doctor. If he doesn't study well, he will be a very bad doctor and might as well risk lives of thousands of patients. His parents have paid 5-10 times the money they earn just so their child can study. Do you think their parents will love him if they ever find out how much he has cheated on them and how much lies he has spoken ? 

Is it better if the child commits suicide ?

"You know what hurts?  What hurts the most is that I thought I had someone beside me, someone who understood. They knew how much I was struggling, knew about my pain, and I thought they were there to support me. I trusted them to be part of my healing, to help me through this, and I believed that maybe—just maybe—I wasn’t alone. But they ended up hurting me (they always have been, it just came to a point where it was too much for me to bear it) in a way I didn’t think was possible, in a way that’s too deep for “hurt” to even capture.

I feel betrayed that I let them into my most vulnerable places only for them to tear me down from within. It feels like a wound that keeps reopening, a betrayal that’s left a scar I can’t hide from.

"HOW TO SUPPORT MY FRIEND WHO IS STRUGGLING  (TW MENTION OF SA,SH,SUICIDE)
As the title suggests, is anyone struggling with supporting a friend through their mental health journey? I’m currently navigating my own mental health challenges and trying to improve. However, hearing about someone else’s depression or mental struggles can sometimes make mine worse. It often pulls me back into negative patterns, and I find myself wanting to sink deeper into it, partly because I tend to be competitive in these situations.

One of my friends is dealing with severe trauma from being SA-ed and while I want to be there for her, I find it difficult to listen when she talks about things like hallucinations, sleepless nights, and her struggles—even though I haven’t had the same experiences. It’s just as hard as hearing her talk about suicide or self-harm. To set healthy boundaries, I’ve asked her not to talk about these topics with me, but she still insists that I’m the only person she feels she can vent to. I want to help, but I don’t know how, and I’m not sure what to do next.

I know she will respect my boundaries, but I know she will struggle in silence and that's even more worse. Can someone who maybe went through similar experiences tell me what you wish you friend did in this situation?",depression

Many of the posts are a mirror of how I feel or used to feel, although I'm much better compared to years ago, sometimes I'm afraid of feeling that deep feeling of sadness again, it's strange but it's the best way I can describe it.
Although for the most part I'm normal, whatever that means, when I have nothing to do it hurts me to think about not having friends, most of the time being with my family is enough for me. But not being able to share a friendship is...

"I'm Shutting Down Hey everyone

This is my first post on reddit, i'm just really stuck and not sure what else to do really, so i'm gonna give this my best shot and maybe get some advice thats been the missing piece all along.

**I have written an 'overall' part at the bottom and my precise ask if you feel like a lighter read.** 

Super, **SUPER,** quick overview: 

* I am 21m
* I smoke weed nightly (For the health conditions below, and to allow for some sleep (Sleep medication is not an option for me, I have addiction issues and don't want to risk it again.))
* I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Depression and PTSD. (All unmedicated, not by choice, but rather  I cannot afford the psychiatrist appointments, and I live in a country where there isn't any sort of beneficiary payment that covers psychiatrists.) 
* 3 **major** traumatic life events in the last two years, all three of which were close-to-deadly circumstances revolving around wars, wars again, and depression.
* My family, along with myself in some places, are fairly well known. There is no such thing as privacy for us, i'm being told by strangers about my life events before i've even really taken them in myself. Yet none of them know any depth to these events so no one even knows that what I really need is just a tiny bit of support. or help. I don't know what I need to be honest. If its a reality check, give me it, and tell me as harshly as possible. 
* I've had some major costs come up due to illnesses and other sort of personal/family issues, which has lead to my once-good savings being drained into the negatives. 

A bit more context: 

1. I am a university student, struggling with my course load (3 degrees), but it genuinely is the only thing keeping me going and there is **no way on earth** I will withdraw/postpone a single paper. I have nothing without this. 
2. I have struggled to make friends my entire life, usually having one or two actual friends at a time, with a couple that have stayed but really no-one else.
3. This year I moved into my flat and made really good friends with one of my flatmates. Great friends, super close. 
4. This friend is leaving for a while, and that is extremely scary in itself for me as I really struggle, as I said, to make friends.
5. I'm doing ok(?) at the moment, at least i'm not at the depths of any sort of depressive episode or whatnot. 
6. Everyday however, I have at least an hour long hysterical crying fit that i just cant control. I get so very overwhelmed to the point of a breakdown, everyday, for months. (This is what ""doing ok"" is to me.) Outside of this ˜hour, I feel this constant threat that something bad will happen, but not  like an earthquake or something, but more so something along the lines of losing all of my friends, losing my (part-time) job, losing my motivation (which is near none anyway), etc etc. I constantly am in fight or flight mode, but i've said that for years, but now I think I truly am at my limit of this 'mode'. I genuinely feel more scared, tense, sad, and angry, right this moment, even just while writing this, than i did when I had a gun at my head last year. How does that even work? possible signs of anxiety? 
7. I get **EXTREME** 'FOMO', and simply get very jealous if my friends make plans without me / my friends have plans I cannot attend. (Hence why i'm writing this, my friends are going out for a couple hours, but I have to head into work very soon, and i'm here hyperventilating, crying, and feeling so so silly.)
8. I constantly, without a break, feel like every one of my friendships (and all relationships really) are hanging on by the thinest thread. **I can't break this feeling no matter what**. I have had those stoned-to-near-non-verbal conversations with my closest flatmate where we both have expressed our appreciation for each other. I have had those illicit substance fulled ""I LOVE YOU BRO"" moments that last hours as we are just able to hang there until sober with the same feelings. Same with other friends too. I've had the ""Hey, I usually don't say this when i'm sober but I am so glad we became friends"". Yet even after all of this, I cannot shake the feeling that all of this is only a fracture away from complete dissolution. 

Overall:

* I feel like i'm about to loose everything, constantly. 
* **I feel like all my friendships are only due to proximity, and that the moment this proximity widens, everything will disappear.** 
* I feel like i'm constantly fighting to get a break, and no matter how hard i fight, i will lose. I pull myself together, fight again; lose again. repeat. 
* I just feel stuck in this loop of wanting to scream ""FUCK THIS"" at literally every single minor thing. I hate it. I want to be just a kind, hard working, relatively happy, *normal* person.
* I have **A LOT** more detail that would make this so much more understandable however I know this post is too long already.

**I know I have been through a fair amount of shit. I don't need to be told that I should give myself a break or anything similar, I get I** ***could,*** **and I** ***have*****, but it's too constant to be continuous chasing a break that never really happens.

"How should I help my depressed 24 yr old girlfriend
 We are not sure if she is really depressed but for a long time, she has not been in a good state because of this she is always tired, can't sleep at night, gets irritated and angry very quickly and often small things spoil her mood.

This started because of her family problems. Her brother (30M), with whom she shared a great bond, has cut her off. He has ignored her for almost a year now because she is doing content creation (it's more like a passion project than a way to earn) and working in a low-paying industry (FNB). He believes she should do some high-earning job and grind like him (Software engineering) and not waste her time.

She was planning to move to Australia but her brother blocked it later he broke his promise of helping her start her own business after listening to his few friends that it might not work (like he did with her moving to Aus)

Right now, he won't talk to her until she does what he says.

He is also troubling her parents with this and everything is leading it to a lot of pressure on her, also she moved to a different city where we met and she lives here with her Uncle and Aunt who are also very toxic.

She wants to move out but can't afford it right now and all this family drama is taking a toll on her.

She is the LOML and we are both sure we want this to last long and really want to help her but I am not sure how, I have never dealt with something like this so if anyone of you can give me some tips I would be very grateful.",depression

And sometimes I appreciate the joy and gift of life but must of the time I’m feeling lonely and worthless although I have a gf, fam, and friends. It’s kinda a contradiction because on the one a hand everything seems fine objectively but on the other hand I just cant deal with the pressure of life. I have this feeling since I am a kid.

"Insecurity as a young father  I have struggled with insecurities as a young father over the last year or two. I was 20 when my oldest daughter was born, she is now six years old. Being a dad is incredible, I love my family and have always wanted to have kids. I spend a lot of time with my children, have a good job, a strong marriage and we are currently having a home built. I just worry so often if I’m good enough. So many other people are having their children later, and I worry that I am not going to be as good of a dad. I worry I won’t be able to provide the same kind of childhood experience.  I’m envious of parents having their children at home when they are at an older age. I’ll be 39 when my daughter graduates high school. I just hope that I’m good enough for my kids, that I can raise them well and given them the patience, understanding and support they need. I feel that if I had even been 5 years older it would have made a difference in my confidence. It seems that other parents have things figured out and are doing a much better job than I am. And I constantly find myself in the sweet moments thinking that its already coming to an end, that my kids won’t be little for much longer. If I had waited, I’d have little kids for a longer time.

"I can’t stop thinking about killing myself  i have struggled with depression for as long as i can remember, some times it’s something i don’t think about, sometimes it’s all that’s on my mind. Suicide used to be a thought i had usually out of spite or complete hysteria, but the last year or so it’s been something i think of randomly, in the middle of the day, when nothings wrong. I can’t seem to live this life correctly, i’ve always felt like im doing everything wrong, school, work, relationships, friendships, family, i fail in every aspect of life constantly, and even if it’s in my head i’ve never felt truly happy about myself or who i am. I’m addicted to weed because it is the only thing that has ever made me feel like i can look at life and think like a normal happy person. it helps me to calm down, but it doesn’t take away the thoughts. socially i’m super bubbly and positive, i don’t think anyone, even my parents who know about my history with struggling, would ever expect me to do anything to harm myself. But i would. i could. and i might. it’s almost like there’s an evil version of myself that lives in my mind and wants me to end it all, and im afraid one day i will. i’m against prescription medication that doesn’t directly keep you from dying, so i’ve never been interested in being medicated. I don’t believe i’ll ever get married or have kids to a happy family, even if my career is booming i don’t have confidence that i’ll be able to keep doing it or that i’ll make it. bottom line is i deeply hate myself. All i want to do is lay down, i never have any real energy, and the happy bubbly persona i put up for those around me is a version of me that doesn’t actually exist. i tell myself it gets better and sometimes i feel like it does, until one small thing happens or one bad mood comes through and im back where i started. if i were to do it id jump off of something so i hopefully don’t have to experience any pain. the idea of suicide used to be about revenge, about wanting them to realize how bad i was hurting, for everyone to feel bad and realize i needed help this whole time, and that i was nice and understanding because i wished someone would treat me that way, but now it’s about myself. i want out. i care less and less about the pain i will cause my family because i am exhausted. the main thing that holds me back is the fact that i believe in reincarnation. what’s the point of dying if i can’t even rest and i’ll immediately have to do it all over again but from the beginning. I love my family, and i know they love me, i have good friends, a good job, i don’t struggle financially, there is nothing wrong with my life, but i am not happy. i don’t think i ever will be. I was hospitalized for a respiratory infection (the first time i’ve actually been a patient at a hospital) and the idea of being ill and not having to do anything but lay there and rest was the best feeling i’ve experienced in a very long time. maybe i’m lazy, so lazy i rather die than fight, i can fake happiness and try to convince myself that it’s better, but it never truly is.

"Idk  I’ve dealt with depression for as long as I can remember. Growing up as a kid I’d go through very high highs & very low lows that would sometimes last days, weeks, sometimes months. I got to highschool and things just switched. I was miserable. I had two attempts in highschool and that’s why I really tried to change stuff. I was in therapy, on meds, I hung out with friends, was in a relationship, sports, camping. I actively tried everyday to feel something, anything other than sad, worthless. It wasn’t until I was 18, I started talking to a woman (psychiatrist) and she helped me tremendously, I’m not exactly sure what changed or what happened but I started feeling better not only about myself but life. Few years went by, got my own place. Working. Things goin well. Until recently, I’m 25 about to be 26 and i don’t catch those thoughts anymore, they slip past me. I hate myself. I wake up and feel nothing anymore, I still try but it’s getting harder and harder everyday. Other than anxiety, sadness is all I feel. Idk really what to do anymore. I read stuff and see people that are twice my age still feeling like this, I don’t want a life like that for myself. Battling between beating myself up or giving up. Im trying but idk.

"I feel like I’ve wasted my youth. I (21F) have been struggling with severe depression for a while.

Those who don’t know me personally would never even think to make this assumption as i am an optimistic performer. I have a very happy demeanor because I am hyperaware of emotional projection, and truly believe people do not deserve any sort of consequence to my personal misery.

I realized my depression and time do not co-exist. I have now spent over 4 years bed rotting and neglecting my physical and mental health by consuming meaningless media, eating food, chasing moments of temporary happiness. These 4 years have felt like weeks, I can’t believe the amount of time i’ve spent neglecting myself.

One of the hardest things to wrap my head around is the fact that although my world has stopped, other peoples continue. I know it’s unhealthy to put yourself in a state of comparison, but it’s true. These years of my life have been crucial and I did it all wrong.

My peers are graduating college, while i got accedamically suspended at community college, now on academic probation as a first year student, when really i should be completing school.

I’m embarrassed, and my parents deeply resent me because of this. They don’t believe in the concept of mental health, my depression is nothing but an excuse to my laziness to them, I wish they knew it runs so much deeper.

I’m so tired of living like this. I don’t understand why it’s so hard for me to love myself. I feel like a burden to everyone I encounter. I am constantly reassured by others that I am a positive light (and for that I am blessed) but my brain deems it as pity, or a wrong assumption due to them truly not knowing who I am.

I don’t know how long this will last, I fear that i will continue down this path and remain stuck in my misery. What sucks is I do believe I have so much to offer and have the potential to be successful, I just don’t know why I can’t be kind to myself.

"Depression  Depression creeps up on you quietly, at the very beginning you struggle with the little things but you usually choose to ignore them. It’s like a headache you tell yourself it’s temporary and it will pass it’s just another bad day but it’s not you’re stuck in this state of mind you get used to putting on a social mask, and you continue to live among other people because that’s what you have to do that’s what others do. 

However the problem does not go away you struggle to put on a play every day and it starts to cost you more and more, that is why you fall even deeper and that’s when you slowly start to back away from friends and family sometimes completely shutting them out.

All satisfaction is gone, the little things that used to bring you joy are now worthless. Even the simplest tasks become painful and that is why you lack motivation now why would you keep on trying if nothing makes you happy anyway? All of this makes you feel even worse and you get caught up in a vicious circle. 

Suddenly you find yourself living in slow motion  days become indistinguishable just white noise just heaviness filling your mind and spilling over your body. You feel as if you’ll never be happy again, you continue to back away and destroy relationships your ashamed for everything you’ve done and everything you’ve haven’t there is a part of you that wanted to make things right a sudden positive upsurge makes you want to go out and meet people but it’s all very short lived because you know it won’t work anyway.

Things that make your friends excited leave you indifferent and you become aware of the huge gap that lies between you and others.

*failure is not an option* so in the end you choose to be alone in your comfort zone where **NO-ONE** asks any questions the low self esteem and the lack of purpose become unbearable… you finally realize you can’t go on that way and two things can happen.

You either *decide to get some help* 

Or you .. 

*might attempt a suicide* ",depression
"How do I word this.. [Male] 27  Imagine feeling every single *fucking* thing or absolutely nothing at all. It’s the attitude difference that hurts the most, jumping off the cliff of joy into the dark waters of depression and… The higher you climb, the harder you fall. 

A pleasant rush, suddenly you become braver more confident your moving mountains, the colours are more intense the music is beautiful the food tastes better the smells bring back memories. Pressured speech and impulsiveness, your full of ideas moving on from one to another in seconds your mind goes faster then your body… you can go on without rest for days and then fall asleep for a couple of minutes thinking it was hours *completely losing track of time* I felt unbreakable, but I already knew that there would be a price to pay. 

The people around you are terrified that your next angry outburst might be right around the corner a bomb that could go off at any second. You assure strangers of your love for their imperfections yet you ignore the people whom are closest and really care about you. You get angry over small things and just keep pushing others away because 

*it’s a fun game too see how far you can bend them until the break* 

“Let’s lose control, I don’t care if you’re hurt or what happens to me. I’m the king of the world & I need no one”

Distraction, you’d do things you normally wouldn’t do everything’s clearer, you lose a dollar you gain a dollar you travel the country on credit cards. It’s all about pleasure, drugs, dance, jokes, spending money, it’s aggression it’s alcohol it’s sex with strangers and you fall in love with one look, one sentence. You spin fast and faster and faster and faster and suddenly

*someone turns the lights off* 

Can you imagine what it’s like to lose interest in everything you ever wanted to do, everything you ever wanted to be? You hit rock bottom where the waters are pitch black you didn’t sleep for a week and now you sleep all day. Your friends, your job, your savings, your motivation, your focus they all keep disappearing one by one as though someone is crossing them off the list, until there is nothing left nothing apart from self-hate low self esteem and all that guilt and shame for what you did when you were high on mania. 

When I’m happy I’m way too happy and when I’m sad I’m way too sad there is no *middle ground* and when life settles down for a brief moment instead of just enjoying it you keep wondering when “will the next episode hit when will I stop feeling okay?” And “is this just mania, or am I just actually truly happy?”

The thing that scares me the most is that *one of those days* I’ll finally find the courage to end it, I’m stuck in the middle im still depressed  but with the mania energy to fulfill my death wish.

But I fight back I .. I fight back with my vices, which I truly love and hate at the same time but even though it hurts sometimes, and I know drugs won’t help me feel at all you know I’d rather have a one dimensional life with sparks of happiness and no real highs then *no life at all*

And- I I just, know i know my depression would have claimed my existence a long long time ago if I didn’t try to control it. 

I know it’s hard but please don’t be scared of me, I didn’t choose this. I’m just like you, I’m just I’m just trying too hold myself together. Just trying to hold myself together while my life is coming apart at the seams. ",depression

"I wanna die more and more every day I never thought it’d get to me writing something on Reddit but I don’t feel heard nor seen anyway so it won’t make a difference I guess. 
I suffer from seasonal depression, I am also autistic with ADHD and so I find it hard to navigate my own feelings and emotions, but I genuinely feel useless. I go through this every year but this has been the worst phase I been through since I can remember. I have to go to work, help everyone with their tasks and sometimes don’t even get a chance to do my own, but I pretend everything is fine, my family drains my finances so I can’t get any savings, I struggle to make ends meet even tho I get paid decently, I get home and, even tho I love nothing more than being by myself, I feel so alone, no one understands and even when I am able to open up a little I’m met with pitty eyes, which I absolutely detest. I just want to leave this world, I want to die but Im too weak to do that because I don’t want my family and friends to suffer because of me, so instead I drink every night and then cut myself to distract myself from the storm in my head. I haven’t cried in years and somehow that makes it worst because I feel so congested and all I wanna do is scream. As a man I’m expected to do all these things, and be serene and cool, calm, composed, but it’s getting tiring and draining. Idk how many more “it is what it is” I have in me before I go completely insane. 
I wish God took me to His warm embrace, here’s to hoping.",depression
"Im not depressed or suicidal I’m not depressed, suicidal or in denial. I am a relatively happy person who enjoys things but man I can’t wait to die!

"I really wish it was easy  
I’m trying to hang on more for the sake of my mom and the people who care, but I’m so fucked up. I’m trying to protect them from pain while I’m constantly experiencing it every second of my goddamn life. I’m not suited for living; my mind wasn’t built for this. Why do I have to keep suffering because I’m not allowed to end my life? It’s hard for me and my family. They see me struggling really badly, and they tell me they’re feeling guilty because they don’t know how to help. So I’m hurting everyone around me by both living and dying. 

My mom begged me today to return to therapy. I couldn’t do it. I’ve tried so many times, but nothing changed. Unfortunately, some people can’t be fixed. I feel sorry for my parents that their daughter is like this. 


I’m sobbing uncontrollably while writing this, because God only knows the pain I’m feeling in my soul. You know since graduation I’ve tried to find purpose for my life to help me keep going; I shifted to a new career, tried therapy, and did all sorts of things that were supposed to help but they weren't. Then I applied for a master's degree, which I’m taking now, but still nothing. All of these things have done  is add to my stress and pain. I’m so empty, numb, and can’t find any purpose for my life. I really wish people could accept more when someone doesn’t want to keep going; life never seems to go my way. I’ve tried and failed, so may be death is the answer; that’s where I will find peace and serenity.

"I 23f moved out of a toxic home to better myself  Like the title said when I was 22 right before my 23rd birthday I moved out on my own. I’m  the youngest of 7 children. I had a dad with a really bad drinking problem, but he is 6 months sober now I’m very proud of him, but that isn’t the point.

"They always say ""it gets better"". It's been 2552 days since my suicide attempt. How much longer do I have to wait until things actually get better? It's never gotten easier to make friends, or get a girlfriend. Four years of therapy can't stop you from being awkward and ugly. When things were looking up and a few years ago I did get a girlfriend and friends, I still felt empty, and that girl would go on to make me feel like I'm worthless.

I'm probably autistic in a world meant for non autistic people. I have thoughts and behaviors behind closed doors that would make me sound like Joe Goldberg and totally identify me as a creep. Why should I gamble with the fact that someday I may do something horrible to someone that they don't deserve?

Why should I live when I am coded to not be happy in this world?

(I swear to god if I see a single ""don't give up"" or ""love is out there"" post without any other context you need to realize you are part of the problem.)

"How to stop comparing yourself with other? I have these issues as long as I can remember.
Especially with my look appearence, always thinking other look better or have more defined face structures. I really don't now how to accept myself finally.

And other issue is that I need to be most of the time productive to have respect for myself. I think that is linked with workacholism, ehy I can not be more free with myself.

My father used to told me that I need to be No. 1 all the time (especially while I was into sports) and that created enormeus complex to me.

"Down in the pit, like a worthless piece of shit. Last week, I was out of the psych clinic or psych ward (I live in France so we got different terms for ""that"") and since I've returned home.. well, it's been hard, and still is. Now I'm smoking marijuana, been diagnosed a BPD, I already knew I had it but I wanted to be sure so that's one of the many other reasons I went to a clinic.
Been taking meds and now...

To be honest, I've done what I could for now...

and now I'm lost, I don't have anyone I can rely on, well more like I don't trust anyone anymore because of the 2 worthless pricks that betrayed me, manipulated me and just shattered what was left of my fuckin' heart in that fuckin' clinic.

Since months now I've been thinkin' of dying.

I'm just tired of everything, and I'm so fckn tired of this world.
Wars, ego, money, etc... You name it.

I'm just done with everything, with everyone.

I wanted to create an alt metal band that could've done something good for this miserable world.

The project was to create a musical safe space for the people in my situation, something they can relate to or something they can use to escape reality for a moment.

But I guess it won't happen either.

I don't even have the strength to end it.

I just wanna end the suffering.

Everything I think everything I hear is all bad. Nothing good. Nothing happy. And I’m trying to get better for my family because they want me to be alive and to be here. But what I want is to be dead. I don’t want a life of this. If they even just felt a bit of what I have to feel everyday they would understand why. It’s not my fault I feel like this. It’s not my fault for past traumas or bullying or just my brain thinking these things. I just feel like there’s no hope for me and it will be better for everyone if I was dead. No more pain. No more voices. No more thoughts about harming myself. Just nothing. It sounds great. We don’t know what comes after death but it’s got to be better than this ,depression
"I feel the day coming I've been on this sub for a little bit and I know what im saying is nothing new or original, and im not here to look for any magical advice or find a new reason to carry on. I just want to get it off my chest and accept it myself.

  
I've been the black sheep of my family since either of my sibings were born, but I dont blame them or even my parents. The only real relationship I had was when I was 15 and we both emotionally and mentally abused each other (as teens do). Im past that now but it's probably what kickstarted my own head being so messed up. I've let myself be emotionally abused several more times over the years I've started thinking maybe I was subconciously searching for it, but idk for sure.

  
A couple of years I reached my tipping point and put a knife to my own throat and sent some subtle messages of appreciation to a few I thought close to me. One of them managed to get me talking to them long enough to make me reconsider and I put it down. After that I have had 2 years of pure optimism, I even tried to make myself depressed and couldn't. I thought I was making good progress until a month ago.

  
It was something stupid over a girl I didnt know well enough to have felt as bad about it as I did, but I kept my distance and it was her that initiated and we grew very close very fast until one day she felt she was moving herself too quickly, which I understood and let her have the space. But the way she instantly changed overnight killed me inside. Now I work a job that I hate, a family being torn apart because my dad decided to up and leave (I still work with him) and every day I feel worse. Last night I felt the way I did on the night I grabbed the knife, and even though I didnt take it this time, I think Im going down that path again.

  
I don't know what I want or what to do, but Im tired of being lonely while everyone leaves me and Im tired of making effort to keep myself in a life I dont like. My mind is always overworking itself and second guessing everything and im just too tired to go on. Maybe I will do it or maybe I wont, but for the forseeable future maybe its for the best.",depression

"Needing help but fearful there isn't any - been fired, abused, ignored, I'm isolated , alone anyway & hurting so much , so tired , I don't know  Terminated from union job a month ago in Oregon filed grievance but finances upended & not okay

Called out sick for FMLA periodic covered condition & was fired because I had no points left . There was no investigation. Had anyone bothered talking to me, this could have been avoided.  
Employer claimed I never told anyone that  I needed FMLA. They have no record so it never happened. Fortunately for me, my manager required me to both text him & call when I had to call out thus I was able to produce the text I sent a month prior to my being fired notifying him that I was at the hospital & needed FMLA as I had an  illness requiring ongoing treatment .  My manager initially denied ever getting any such message before admitting he must have but never reported it.  
The company responded by claiming I should have known to contact the outside company that handles FMLA but I did nothing so they are arguing the termination was justified. Problem for them is I did not wait for them to respond to my FMLA request, I downloaded forms off the Department of Labor website & sent them to my doctor. She completed them the same day they fired me.  
Just to make my position clear, I had notified my manager 3 weeks prior that I needed FMLA without receiving a response. 
I thought I'd be reinstated right away but it's been a month . Oregon has instituted a nightmare of system requiring them to mail me a code I've been waiting for 3 a month.

It's been well over a year since I thought that I was taking care of myself by doing all these things to shut up the noise in my brain. But this week has been too overwhelming.

"Levels of depression  There are 3 distinct levels of depression for me. I know it’s not the same for everyone 

1. The most common form is also the least severe. It comes with a general flattening of the world. I lose the receptivity that allows me to feel strongly about anything. Activities I enjoy hold little attraction. I feel somewhat numb and dumb. 

2. A more physiological stage, where even simple movements take a lot of effort. Reward centers are not working at all. I have no appetite. Getting though the day and the tasks required of me is extremely difficult. Most of the features of 1 are also present. 

These first two are largely subtractive. It’s like pieces of me are missing. The third is different 

3. This is far more extreme than the others. It comes with a burning pain unlike anything else. It in no way resembles sadness. Similar to a toothache, I cannot think about anything else. My mind is full of repetitive dark phrases and I’m just waiting out the clock to run out. It’s hard to be still. Thankfully it doesn’t happen very often.

These states come over me without reason. It is unlike anxiety which usually has triggers. I try to think of them as you would when you are sick with a virus. Mitigate symptoms if possible and tell myself it will pass",depression

"Am I alone or anyone can relate to this feeling? I have been experiencing the lose of interest in doing any tasks and even no mood or drive to exercise. I am feeling like this regularly recently, there nothing else to do during these times, but to just wait for the wave to move. So that I can regain the focus back. Pain has become really unbearable with body saying this is too much for me. I feel like I want to cry, but there is agony or anger inside me that wants to scream out loud and smash and break things. I can't even cry or scream... maybe I think I am not in the safe place for these kind of expressions. This makes to question my reality and thought of ""what to fight for?"" comes to my mind.

The best way I can describe it will be like an Alien vs Predator movie when the Aliens pop out of the human body. I understand that it’s here with me until I’m no more…. Doing things that are supposed to help with my happiness isn’t doing it. I’m really in autopilot mode disassociating to the max….. Thanks for hearing me vent",depression
"Dealing with inferiority 
Hey- I’m 26. For education I have nothing. Been a factory worker the past 2 years. Burned out in high school then failed college.

I have an idea for what I want to do. Only problem is it’s going to take me until age 29 or 30 to get into the field, which means at 30 I’ll be where most people are at when they’re 21.

Being inferior isn’t just a pride thing- it limits your options, it limits your relationships. It’s hard to be motivated knowing that regardless of how hard you work, you are worse than 99% of the population. 

It’s hard to not be resentful of the average person.

"I'm on two sides of a fence, where I look well enough that no one suspects I am severely depressed.  Content: I'm in college and i suspect i've been depressed since I hit puberty. Unfortunately it was really hard for anyone to notice and i think it still is. My grades never suffered because of it. I was a straight A student until today.  I did self harm in ways that didn't leave a physical mark on my body, (I was afraid of anything more) so i had no scars to explain and no reason to worry friends or teachers. My mom threatened to pull me out of school and have me sent to a psych ward if i did it again. She hates psych wards and made them sound as scary as possible. 
 I never had a big public breakdown like i thought depressed people would. 
I no longer want to harm myself and don't have the energy for that sort of thing. It scares me and triggers me without a doubt.  But life still sucks terribly, and I don't know how to feel. I wonder if I had acted out more, if I had been more of a bad kid, that I would have received more help then I have today. I'm frustrated. No visible signs that I am depressed, and no proof for others that I need help. I'm still someone who gets their work done and looks fairly normal on the outside. It sucks and I hate it. 
I'm only just staring therapy and only because it's free. I cant afford it otherwise and don't have a a job. I feel like if I say the wrong thing i'm going to get locked up in a ward like my mom told me. 
Shit is tiring and I feel physically ill all the time. I cant tell my friends, who are also depressed, because I feel manipulative. I feel like a bad, selfish person for wanting someone to notice me and save me, for constantly thinking ""What about me?"" whenever feelings come up. I am drowning in hatred of myself. ",depression

It’s hard because everything feels quiet and I can’t see a way out of this feeling and I don’t know how to not feel like this. I’m meant to be the strong person for my friends and I can’t even I don’t know I just wish I was better and meant something to someone.

"I was almost kicked out of my grad school program and I feel like a complete and utter failure I just started my new winter term at my school. Last term, I took a class that was tough by two different professors. Their styles were drastically different. For their final exam I studied very hard. I spent hours in my room every day for a week, trying to get the material down. Down when I took the exam, I was very underprepared. It turns out, nobody else was either. My classmates, and I believe that there was not very very much communication between my two instructors.

My professors ended up upgrading the exam on a curve. And I still got a D+. Today, I had a phone call with the director of my program. She said that I was very lucky that they graded on a curve, because if they didn’t, I would not be in the program. I know I should just be happy that I was given a chance, but it still devastates me that I could’ve been kicked out. I just feel so stupid. maybe there have been one or two other classmates of mine that were also in the same predicament, but I know most of my classmates weren’t like that at all. ",depression
"heard somewhere comparison is the key to change, but then I'm stuck being a failure My life isn't even that tragic, but I struggle with depressive disorder since being a literal kid. It's hereditary, so I just came to this world with this and fuck me.

Thing is, my crucial academic period (the transition between High School and College) was heavily, and I mean heavily fucked by the pandemic. My depression became so much worse that my cognitive capacities were BAD, my memory lasted literal minutes.

I've been better, but now I'm stuck not having a degree, not being able to find a job, and not being too able to study because my treatment barely even started to pace up.

My brothers are geniuses, an engineer and a teacher. They have amazing curriculum and are the stars of the family. and me? I'm just a little worm taking up space.

I guess I just needed to vent? but I'm struggling so much with having the bare minimum compassion for myself. It is becoming a much bigger of a disorder. I try to eat much less so I don't waste food on myself, don't drink as much water so it's not wasted on me, try to be out most of the time so I don't up the energy bill.

At this point I really do feel like it'd much easier to just, you know. and the act of Living feels so much like torture. I don't know what I should feel. Or do. I just wish I wasn't myself.",depression

"How does depression get worse? I want to know how depression ultimately gets worse. How can you go from functioning and still having goals to almost completely unmotivated and lost? What causes you to fall into an even lower state and maintain those levels unlike before? 

The best example I can use to describe this is that I was alone all of my first year of university, and I came to terms with it. Now, I am somehow more erratic and can't stand loneliness unlike how I could tolerate it everyday.

I hope what I'm asking makes sense. My depression used to be mild, but it somehow developed into more moderate and it's actually starting to impact my life.

"Addiction, Depression and Rage I’m numb as I type this. My life has been spiraling over the last few months but everything really hit the wall when I got into a car accident 2 weeks ago and totaled my car because someone decided to turn left while my light was green. Ever since then, I’ve been reliant on weed, clonazepam and alcohol to cope with how I feel. I’ve been silently fighting addiction to alcohol for the last year and now it’s only gotten worse. I’m filled with so much rage, I’m constantly lashing out at my partner and causing arguments.. pushing him away although I just want him to be there for me. 

My partner doesn’t seem to understand me or maybe I don’t understand him. The things he says as advice or to be “helpful” aren’t helpful at all. I feel judged and unheard. I feel like I’m crying out for help and nobody is listening. I want nothing more than to feel at peace within myself. I want nothing more than to be happy.

Lately... there's just so much work. I feel so drained and empty. I've had depression for a long time, too. And recently, I found a suicide method that seems pretty effective.

But after finding it, I felt strangely at ease, like this is all coming to an end, maybe? And then, for the first time in years… I actually thought, 'I want to live.' It's weird. I never thought there’d come a day when I’d feel like that. When I've already tried so many deadly attempts. I don’t even know if this is really how I feel.

But for now, since there are a few things I need to prepare, I plan to stay alive this month. I'll get rid of my belongings, and maybe visit places I always wanted to see. Even as I'm writing this… I just don’t know what I'm supposed to do. It's like there's this feeling that my mind could change?

We started arguing more and more until I couldn’t take it anymore and I ended things. The single biggest regret in my life. I should have fought harder to keep the woman of my dreams but the depression took over thinking I would be better off alone.

Turns out that was wrong, I’m not better off alone. We broke up, she moved out, 3 weeks later I had to put my cat down. Things started spiraling out of control. I have no motivation to go to work anymore, I don’t see my friends like I should, no one to talk to about how I’m feeling.

I have never been good at expressing my feeling and telling people what I’m going through. And that reason right there is why we broke up. I was an idiot and didn’t express anything.

I made her a promise that I wouldn’t drink my life away and at first I was doing well, and then depression got worse and worse and now it’s the only thing I have found that makes me feel something for only a little while. 

She is all I can think about, I regret it, I want her back more than anything. I am willing to do anything to get her back but I know deep down inside she doesn’t want it. I have cried myself to sleep every night for the last month and a half.

I hate myself for not trying harder. I don’t want her back because I’m lonely, I want her back because she meant the absolute world to me and I would do anything I possibly could to make her happy. I beat myself up every day.

My best part of my day was coming home from a bad day at work to see her beautiful face, give her a hug and feel that bad day be lifted off of my shoulders. If I could go back in time and do things differently I would in a heart beat. But I can’t so now what?

I’ve thought about just ending my life because what’s the point of living if I can’t have her. Told her I would wait as long as I had to for us to be together again and I truly meant that. She is the only person I want to be with, the only person I want in my life. 

I love her more than I love myself. ",depression
"Hopelessness I'm very much feeling hopeless.

Thinking of my life, and like if I ever lose the job that I do have now idk what's going to happen.

"New dad to be So im gonna be a dad any week now but I have alot of passive scucidal thoughts date even before my wife was pregnant. 

I'm in a good relationship and wanted kids but now I can't see myself succeeding to give this kid everything I had growing up do to my lack of career succses and failure to make lasting changes.

I cry about leaving them but I don't believe in myself or have hope thing will improve. It appears things will only continue to get harder for me as time goes on and I'm just not the type of person who can step up.

I Certain my family will take care of my wife and kid when im eventually gone. I understand it selfish but I can't be expected to just deal with these feeling for the rest of my natural life that's not fair to me. 

So im ok with being a loser if it means I can get out of the spiraling depression and lies that it will get better somehow.

8m on medication many diffrent types and im going to therpy but both have not made a great impact and folks say it can take years of finding something to help. I don't feel I have years to spend.

It is just horrible when you finally seek help but it's not helping so your disillusioned on what to do from there besides pretend it ok when It's not. My frustration just builds and I can't find a way out or pause anything in my life. I'm tired of complaining g like a little bitch abd not doing anything about it so I eventually see my self taking my own. Life to settle the issue once and for all.  

I really wish I could just live with my wife and child with out the depression but the reality is im not good enough to make that happen and no body is capable of helping me figuer it out without lying to string me along I. A faint hope things just get better.

I dont have a question here and don't expect anything. I guess it's a vent that il just do again until I die.

Hope others figuer there lives out better than I have.",depression

"This is the first time I’ve seriously considering ending it all  The election. My family. I have two teenagers. I get that they’re teenagers. But I am so so tired of being the maid, the chauffeur, the cook, the ATM. I’m tired of not being treated like a person. Like I might have my own thoughts and feelings. My husband is so preoccupied with being RIGHT that he doesn’t care if there isn’t a right. You hurt my feelings. I didn’t say you did it on purpose. Why can’t he just acknowledge that he hurt my feelings. Say sorry, that’s not what I meant to do. Why does being right matter more than showing your wife you care about her? I’m just so so tired. Tired of fighting. Tired of defending my decision to make fucking soup for dinner. Why is that an argument? Why is talking to me in the morning a chore? Why can’t you take your earbuds out and put your phone down for 25 minutes a day? I’m so tired. I’m so alone. You don’t acknowledge my presence now, would you even notice if I were gone. ",depression

"In 15 days. In 15 days I turn 18. I have already had the worst 2 weeks of my life. 

My name is Michael. When I was 10 I moved schools, losing everyone. When I was 11 all my step family and half sister left. When I was 12 my dad was sent to jail for... I'm not really sure. 

When I was 10 I got diagnosed with FA, I'm in a wheelchair, everything hurts. 

Recently I was in a relationship, then she left. I have no one, I am no one.

Today I had the darkest thought about her, I figured I'll go through the pain I was imagining on others. When I do it, it will be slow, probably will cut every part of me before bleeding out.

"I honestly don't know what to do☹️ This is just a little rant.

19m I'm autistic don't have a job nor a license and i don't know if I have depression but I probably do.

All I really do in my free time is play video games and cook good food.

Everything feels like it takes absolutely so much effort that I don't even bother doing anything hell I can barely even get myself to brush my teeth.

I don't think I'm addicted to videogames since when I actually have fun outside of that I rarely think about them but it's just mainly what I do.

I just want to feel like actually doing something. Sometimes randomly at night I will all of the sudden have so much energy and want to do something productive that actually matters... Then it's gone by morning.

All of this basically got 3x worse when last year my grandma(who was like a mother to me) died then the day afterwards my gf(who I also loved a lot) started making excuses on why she could not call or hangout and when I told her what happened she made up more excuses on why she could not hang out.

She did this for 2 months when I just gave up on her then I found out she was cheating on me. 

So my gf cheated on me while I was mourning the death of the women who raised me as a child.

After the worst of it I've gotten slightly better but I still don't ever have any motivation to do anything and that happened over A year ago.

I just want my motivation back.

I would see a therapist or something but my dad is probably just gonna grill me on why im depressed make himself into some sort of victim. 

I honestly don't even know what to do. I just don't feel like I can do anything or fight what's happening anymore. I just feel tired but that's how I always have felt it's just worse now.",depression

I was 8 and he was 6 but he still made me do shit to him. I kept this to myself for the longest time until I saw him doing it to my younger sister. I told my parents about it and social services got involved. We were put on a child protection plan and eventually, everything got dropped. But everything has just gone downhill lately... Big time.. My brother is a really messed up person, he's 14 now and i'm 16, and he causes issues with my parents. He ran away almost 3 weeks ago now and social services have gotten involved again.

I'm so fucking tired of living, I really really am. I have cut myself and tried to kill myself in the past and honestly, I want to really end myself this time. My brother is a liar and he'll end up telling people that I did stuff to him, that I made him do stuff. My parents will and up believing him too, so I just wanna end everything.

"I just don't see the point of going on. Age 22 and just starting college. Been dealing with depression, anxiety, and high-functioning autism my whole life. Depression has gotten worse since age 11. Have been taking pills and seeing all sorts of therapists, social workers, and mentors for a variety of issues.

I just don't see the point of going on in life. Everyone around me says ""Things will get better"" or ""You're just lazy and need to get out of this funk"". All I hear is a bunch of lies being fed to me. I don't see how the people close to me have hope or happiness. I don't understand what they mean when they say that I'm smart or that they believe in me or talk about hopes, dreams, having a career, and the future. All it does is make me laugh or feel viscerally disgusted.

I already have three F's in my college courses halfway in and every time I look at the work I feel a deep sense of demotivation. I only have two A's one in Philosophy and one in Math. I never even wanted to go to college I just wanted to try and have a job no matter how monotonous it would have been. All I hear from my mother with any of this is that she won't have her child be a bum and that I need to attend for 4 years so that I can get a respectable job. She promised that it would be a good experience for me; all it has amounted to is a lie.

Hearing all this crap just makes me want to end it more. The only problem is that I'm too much of a coward to take the more painful ways out and don't have access to the relatively easy ways either. Not to mention that everyone will be on the lookout if I do something out of the ordinary.

They've already stopped me around 4 times before and I think I'm starting to genuinely resent them for it.",depression

"I’m totally worn out I'm in the bathroom at work rn crying and bargaining with god. 

I am totally discarded and unwanted. I have been forced to realize in this life I have no value. I did everything. I asked for help I tried. I grew up in a narc family. The scapegoat. They can't stand me. My own family. I did good in school. I went to the gym. I never snuck out, smoke or drank. I was groomed and abused at 17 by friends dad and my family used it as reason to validate not liking me. I was raped and they blamed and pushed me away. I went to therapy and my therapist was so mean to me and said I dress like a ""man eater"". My sister said my therapist doesn't have to be nice to me. 

 I literally tried my best. I'm watching ppl be treated or normally and form bonds with others while I'm rejected and beat down constantly. My parents know abt my depression and sent a picture of my dog to me after she died. Then they got rid of the cat I love. They know I'm depressed and sick and they want me gone. My own family doesn't care and don't want me. My mom boast abt how close she was to aborting me. 


Ppl that commit suicide aren't lazy or weak or stupid. We really all tried our best. I'm trying. Some ppl were like me and were denied any connection, compassion, respect, dignity or support. I mean nothing to nobody and ppl try to make it known how worthless I am. I seriously tried hard all my life and it amounted to constant abuse and trauma. 

Some ppl don't know what it's like to be constantly be abused, be rejected, torn apart and put down and u can never figure out why. Now I keep having unwanted recurring intrusive thoughts about my Sexual assault. I keep reliving all the abuse and I'm scared to go to therapy again. I've always been nice and helped others and it meant nothing. 


For some reason some ppl mean nothing. We r outcasted and viewed and worthless and anyone can do anything to us and it won't matter bc we r nothing with no value. How can I live a life where I'm nothing?

"Might as well post this into the void I just got diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and like two other things recently along with already having autism and an eating disorder. I cry myself to sleep every single night and I can rarely get out of bed or find enjoyment in anything I do unless it’s work and even then I don’t feel happy at all. I have a really hard time expressing my emotions at all to other people and this is my way of getting it out there since I am having a hard time telling my friends and family. My parents and sibling mistreated me and emotionally neglected me until I was about ready to graduate high school. My brother bullied me a lot as a kid and my mom has been and still is a severe alcoholic with addictions to prescription painkillers. I always found myself fixing everyone’s shit growing up and never having any attention or any needs given to me at all while my brother was showered with praise and respect. I had almost no friends growing up and when I would make a friend I was forced to move states because my family is navy servicemen. I really didn’t have a true friend until recently and even then I still feel lonely as absolute dogshit. Although I’m autistic I am really book smart and have a high in uet I struggle when it comes to socializing and being around people. I think it stems from having to fake it till I make it happiness wise when I was a kid because my family raised me on the whole men don’t cry kind of deal. My eating disorder also stems from the same thing because my parents would yell at me for hours if not days for not being able to eat certain foods and on one occasion grounded me for 4 months for not being able to eat chicken. In high school my mom went into pyschosis and mentally tormented me with constant guilt tripping and anger fits that severely worsened my mental health. I always felt that I was the one picking up the pieces and being the garbage can and tool for fixing problems instead of being treated like an actual human being. Everything I ever did in life was to please my parents and now looking back at it I regret every single one of those decisions. I chose a blue collar career that I can’t even get hired into and I have a shit ton of problems when it comes to loving people since my social anxiety doesn’t help meeting new people and I feel that my love is dependent on what I can do for them and not how they actually feel about me. Every single person I have been with has dropped me like a neglected toy and I’m having trouble coping with how I feel about myself and my self worth. I’m forcing myself right now to write this because I have no other way to say these things to other people. I hate that I’m so emphatic to other people but I can’t be empathetic to myself and I end up valueing other people instead of valuing myself. I feel I was raised to be somebody’s emotional support yet nobody takes time out of their day to do it for me unless I cry for help. I haven’t heard how’s your day or anything simple like that in years and nobodies genuinely cared to ask me how I feel or be a shoulder I can lean on while I’m exhausted of dealing with people that don’t care about me enough to even give me the truth. I’m still living with my parents and they act like they never did any of this shit yet my memories are scarred with it and I can never forget it. I feel gaslit into believing my parents are good people because in the last year they “changed” yet I can’t really move on or forgive them. I sit quietly in my room everyday imaging fake lives and hope yet I have none to give. It feels like I’m drowning and somebody’s standing there refusing to give a hand or help and that makes what I’m going through a hundred times worse. I have no money and though I wish I could move out and start anew that’s just not possible for months if not years. I feel genuinely hopeless and everything I do to improve myself makes me only sadder. It’s like my stability depends on other people’s happiness or my perception of it. It feels like my life has been a lie and I have nothing to show for it except being the shoulder for somebody to lean on all the time. I don’t know man it’s just difficult as shit and I don’t have anybody to talk to about this right now or at least none I can tell my true feelings towards. Like everybody I know is happy all the time and has a good life and I’m struggling a shit ton and constantly depressed and I don’t know what to do about it. I got put on medication (Wellbutrin and hydroxyzine) but it makes me feel extremely dizzy, nauseous, and doesn’t help how I feel at all. I have to wait weeks till I can see a psychiatrist again and I’m hesitant towards therapy and counseling because of my extreme social anxiety. I’ve had trouble with this for years and this is the first time bundling it up and getting it all out in one piece instead of having to hide it deep down and take a smile I don’t have and laugh a laughter that I don’t feel. I feel numb all the time like nothing matters at all and the only joy I feel is when others feel it and even then i feel like it’s fake all the time. Like I don’t actually experience happiness just a reflection of it. I wish that I never existed every night though I’m too cowardly to take my own life and to harm myself. I feel like a slave in my own skin and I can’t shake this feeling no matter what I do.",depression
"Wanting to leave quietly  I've been having suicidal thoughts for about 4 years now but at the same time I know I'm not able to actually do it.

I can't help but feel it's selfish of me to leave them when all they did is give me their love and support. I feel obligated to stay as long as my parents are alive to keep them company and to care for them. Also I couldn't bare to put that shame of ""their daughter killed herself"" on them, we live in a small town so everyone knows everyone already. The only way out I can imagine while they're still alive is if I get into a tragic accident. Even though I'm thinking about my own death I can't help but worry how it will affect other people. Who is gonna find me dead and be traumatised. That's stopping me from jumping in front of a car. Imagine the poor driver having to witness that and feeling guilty.

"i need help I have a history of panic disorder and anxiety, but somehow never had depression...until now. To be completely transparent, whenever I heard people having depression, I didn't take it that seriously. I should have, especially as a current medical student and someone with a mental health disorder. But I never understood it...because I never had it.

But now I do.

I am currently at the lowest point in my life. I've been panic attack free for the past 2.5 years. I've been loving my life. However, within the past month, I've had a friend pass away, I developed marital issues that have since been resolved (which was the inciting event that caused the depression), and I have finals coming up in a few weeks. Despite resolving the issue, I have been massively depressed.

I have never experienced the inability to find motivation to take a shower, to brush my teeth, to eat. In fact, my appetite was so large that I had to diet because I gained so much weight. It has been 5 days and I struggle to even take a few bites of anything. I have no motivation to study. This depression is so debilitating...that gnawing, sinking, crushing feeling in my chest is present all the time. I keep crying. I've reached out to my therapist, friends, husband, psychiatrist, my professor...and I keep crying. I've increased my SSRI dose and I keep crying. I'm still depressed. I can't find it in me to do anything. 

I know I have to keep pushing. The unit is almost over, and it has been the worst and most intensive unit thus far. The fear of failing, the fear of not being able to become a doctor, the fear that this depression will never go away is not making it better. I feel so stuck...

I'm sorry for ever minimizing anyone's depression experience. I now know how bad this is...I know that this is so real...I know that this is the hardest shit anyone can ever go through. ",depression

23m, overweight, broke and indebted, fucking balding, autistic, ADHD, complete loser college dropout with no real prospects who's only ever fucked once and somehow even managed to fuck that up

My life is shit. I spend entire days doing nothing but trying to escape my soul-grinding reality. Alcohol, drugs, porn, video games, you name it. Anything to distract me from what an absolute disappointment I am.

And yet, here I am.

I've planned my own suicide 7 times. I've picked a date each time. I've written 3 different letters to my family about it, one of which they accidentally found and nearly institutionalized me for.

And yet, here I am.

Most nights I go to sleep praying that I won't wake up. Most nights I want nothing more than to just drift off into eternal sleep - to be free from all of this confusion and frustration and humiliation.

But here I am.

I don't know why, or how, but I'm still here. Beaten, bruised, but alive and kicking. Maybe it's because I was raised by a strong Mom. Maybe it's just not in my genes to give up that easily. Maybe I'm just a stubborn bastard, but after all this time, after so many nights thinking that I'd finally reached my breaking point, I'm still here. 

I still have those nights, and they never get easier. Something tells me I'm going to have them one way or another for the rest of my life. But I'm not going to let life slip by me so easily.

"Need Advice Hello everyone,

I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to share some personal challenges I’ve been facing recently with my mental and emotional health, and get some perspective on my situation.

For a while now, I've been struggling to find a fulfilling direction in my career. I'm currently working in HR. The job is stable, pays well, and is objectively good, yet I feel deeply unsatisfied. It’s like something is missing, and I can't shake the feeling that I want to be doing something else.

One of my long-standing interests has been in tech. I’ve tried pursuing programming, specifically web development. I completed a bootcamp on Udemy, covering both front-end and back-end aspects, and invested a lot of effort into it. But each time I tried to apply what I learned, I felt drained. My interest, which was strong at the start, kept fading over time, until it completely disappeared. This cycle has left me frustrated and confused about my own motivation.

I started reading about motivation, discipline, and focus, hoping to understand why I keep losing steam on projects that initially excite me. I even explored different areas like IT and data analysis, and tried working out to boost my mental energy, but I keep hitting the same wall. It’s as if there’s some invisible force holding me back, like trying to break down a wall with a plastic hammer.

For a long, this has started affecting more areas of my life. I feel empty and disconnected from things I used to enjoy, like gaming, watching videos, and even simple daily activities. I still have dreams and goals, but I’m struggling to muster the energy to pursue them, no matter how much I try to motivate myself.

At this point, I’ve decided to start seeing a therapist to understand if there’s something deeper going on. I’d also love to hear any opinions or similar experiences. Am I just lacking discipline, or could there be more to it, possibly something that therapy or even medication might help with?

Thank you for listening and for any advice you can share.",depression
"Failed life Damn it hits me now

I have purposed my whole life for education and strict life.

Where fun is no part of. I cant keep my guard down. Never. If i let it down slighly i can fail everything.

In doing so i never experienced love. Im scared i never will. Im getting old 24m. Im ugly and poor also. So i dont see any chance anymore.

In doing so i got to porn. Where im now addicted heavly. I cant stop

I failed my life. I failed everything in my life. 

- I dont have a good income despite doing so good on school and being almost a bachelor degree.
I have changed course 3 times, now i think im at the right track. So i lost so much time studing things i will mostly not do

- My mind is corrupt by porn

- never went on a date. I never had a gf in my life. 
  Prostitute give me the chance in april to touch her or else i wouldnt had ecperience that. 
But im still virgin

- im weak, i dont take risks. Because if i do something im thinking about all possible outcome and if the negative one is to bad. I stop and dont the thing

You know wgat the modt bad part is. I dont have purpose in my life anymore.

Im living for myself, i dont want kids.
I want a gf only so i cant satisfy myself. Im not gonna lie, its about the sex. I want sex only. 

Im scared to fall in love, i dont know how i will be. I dont know hiw she will be. Im not preoared for a relationship and i dont think i ever will be. No one is going to date a ugly poor stinky dude.

So sex is the only thing i want from a woman then.
I sound bad but thats my intension.

Im so sorry if i failed amyone in my life. It was never my intention to do so. Life didnt go as i thaught or planned. 

I said to myself i will never be jealous of someone else. Yet a fellow student who is younger than me took all the risk and is doing a lot better in another country where i wanted to go to. He can get any girl he wants.
He did everything i wanted to do in my life. But still im happy for him. 

In my life i dont need much lol

- good income
- good health with good healthcare
- a tiny house is all good im just one person
- sex

I dont live in usa
I dont wanna tell all i can say is im living in south america.

"Please comment I have really bad periods of depression. My life is pretty bleak, and looks quite hopeless. I just would like some advice on how to be more positive or rational.

I know lots of people stress the enjoyment of little things, but I am seriously not wired that way. 

I try to keep myself busy, but any happiness from that is growing even more short-lived. It feels like everything that once or could’ve made me happy is slowly fading. I’ve tried winter arcs and trying to build myself up and everything blows up in my face.

"Am i depressed? Confused Hello everyone,

I just got diagnosed with depression by a psychiatrist, and I’m feeling pretty uncertain about it. The diagnosis felt quick, and I was anxious during the session, which makes me worry I didn’t communicate my situation fully. I may have just looked miserable because I really needed someone to listen, and now I’m left wondering if the diagnosis is accurate.

The thought of taking medication is overwhelming – I would prefer to try psychotherapy first, but I’m unsure if that’s the right path. Here’s a list of the main things I’ve been struggling with, and any advice or insights would be so appreciated:

	•	Extreme fatigue – I have hyperthyroidism (Hashimoto’s), so I’m unsure if the fatigue is due to that or depression.
	•	Low self-esteem and confidence – I’ve become really sensitive to others’ opinions, and my confidence has taken a huge hit.
	•	High social anxiety and people-pleasing – I tend to put others’ needs first, even when it’s not good for me.
	•	Feeling overwhelmed and undisciplined – I constantly feel like I have so much to do, yet I don’t feel like I’m succeeding in any area of my life.
	•	Demotivation at work – My tasks feel boring, and I don’t trust my managers, which just adds to my insecurity.
	•	Loneliness – I feel like no one really listens or cares about what I’m going through right now.
	•	Existential and religious doubts – I’ve been wrestling with big questions about life and faith, which just leaves me feeling more lost.
	•	Pessimism – I find myself expecting the worst and struggling to see positive outcomes.
	•	Sensitivity to noise – I get easily irritated by people talking around me or loud environments.
	•	Daydreaming and escapism – I’ve been daydreaming since childhood as a way to escape my feelings, and I still find myself doing it now at 26.

All of this has left me feeling really alone, like I don’t have anyone to lean on – not even God sometimes. Has anyone been in a similar place and felt unsure about a diagnosis? Help me please",depression
"I feel so broken…. The guy who I thought I was gonna be with for the rest of my life has put me thru so much pain and betrayal and suffering and I just don’t know how I’m suppose to trust anyone after all of this. 

To start off, we knew each other back in high school. We had been friends for 7 years before we officially got together and 6 weeks into the relationship I got pregnant, so we moved pretty fast. But even though we had a rocky start, we were together for 4 years before I had to go away to rehab for a year because I failed a UA while on probation. I told him before I had to leave “If you can’t wait for me, please let’s end things now. I love you but I understand I can’t ask you to wait a year for me.” And he said he’d wait. I really really believed him…

I would write to him at least 3 to 4 times a week. And when I got phone privileges, I bought calling cards and would call him on the days I was allowed to call. I told him all the progress I was making, how I was actually having to dig deep and I was finding out a lot of the problems I had and why I was in my addiction and my triggers and everyday. Sometimes we’d fight but it’d be over me wanting to get an apartment with our son and him gradually moving in (he had his own apartment). I had never moved out of my parents and I wanted to be able to learn to support myself in case anything happened. And when I was there my last 2 months I got to leave the center to work but with strict rules and being driven to and from work. So I didn’t get to call hi m as much since I worked most days. 

So a week before I was suppose to come home, he stopped answering my calls…and 4 days before I was suppose to leave he breaks up with me for another girl…and I’m not going to blame him for my relapse as soon as I graduated. I made the choice. But I had worked so hard making goals for my family, goals so I could be a better woman for him. And I felt broken. And I feel ashamed to say we still messed around. He’d show up to our hotel rooms with hickeys all over his neck. Something he never let me do when we were together….and I’d know she was at his apartment in his bed sleeping but I’d still get in his car and mess around….thinking back on it makes me sick. But I thought I could win him back..

After 3 months I told the girl what we were doing out of anger. And she ghosted him. And he was all heartbroken and would cry all the time. And I stupidly was there to make him feel better. Well I thought I was. He still stayed single, crying over her because he thought he loved her and found the one…..hearing it broke me every time. And after a few months he was over it, and said he’d get back together with me…if I gave him a threesome….

I always thought that multiple partners at once was disgusting (no offense to anyone who actually does this frfr this is just my opinion. I believe in having sex with someone you love or see a future with.) but I loved this man more than anything. And I attempted with his ex, bad choice I know, and I started crying during it….and he got angry. It lead to a lot of drama with my family, but afterwards he said he didn’t want one anymore and I got excited. I thought he’d finally take me back. Then, the accusations started. 

For weeks he kept accusing me of cheating on him, not now but literally 4 years prior (after I had our son). He would drill me everyday about going out all the time and hanging out with dude dealers everyday (I was active in my addiction but the majority of the time he was with me when I bought from people, and my main dealer was female!) but he just kept accusing me and one day he said “Please we can work thru it just please tell me you did it.” So I lied. I said I slept with someone else. And that’s when the shit storm started. 

Everyday it was name calling. Putting me down. Calling me a whore and crying how he was faithful to me the whole time (🙄) until a month before I graduated rehab. Then even more accusations started. “He did anal with you before me huh? Yal had a threesome didn’t yal? He used lube with you first didn’t he?” I had no idea where any of this had come from and why he was so angry with me all the time. I just wanted it to stop. I told him whatever he wanted to hear just to stop the screaming and the name calling. I would beg him to believe me. That I never slept with anyone else. But he refused. So then I’d just give up, I’d say I did whatever he thought I did. But he’d ask for details and I had none to give because nothing happened! Then I was labeled a whore and a liar. When I never wanted to lie. I just wanted him to stop yelling at me and stop assuming me of things I never did. 

Ultimately, to sum everything up, I tried to give him a threesome again, i cried again.  Then again with a different girl and he finished in her which hurt me so bad because I told him that was like my only condition. And tried one more time and he was on viagra so we stopped after literally 2 hours of having sex (I learned to not show my tears but I was crying the whole time) and it would have counted. But I stupidly told someone I thought was my friend that it was the worst experience of my life. 

I forgot to mention. That whole he was crying saying he was faithful the whole time? I literally found out after I got my own place and let him live with me for a week that he cheated with not one woman, but 3 other women. And I found out by getting a girl that slept with him to call him with me on the phone and he admitted to cheated 4 to 6 months before I was suppose to come home. So I kicked him out a week later. And now he says I never gave him a chance to be a father. When all he’s cared about since I got home was sex sex sex! 

Now we are at this point where he thinks I never loved or cared about him. He thinks I had multiple threesomes with multiple other people. I told him honestly after all the shit he’s put me thru, bragging about all the women he sleeps with and how they are so much better than me. He’s called me fat, ugly, a groundhog, loose, used up, and said I stink down there like….and somehow at the end of it all I’m the bad guy? I’m the one that broke our family? I’m the one that cheated the whole time and he claims at least he was “honest the whole time” but yet I can name so many lies he’s told. And he’s admitting to lying and never getting caught. So like…I don’t get it. 

And I hate more than anything that I miss him so much….i miss the way he used to look at me and would grab at me and call me his….i miss seeing his eyes sparkle when he talked about things he was interested in. I miss videoing him skateboarding and cheering him on like a cheerleader. He was my best friend. When I get excited, he’s the first one I want to call. When I’m sad, I want him to cheer me up. I still try and show him how much he means to me. But now he doesn’t care. 

I hate this so much. I wish I could go out and just do whatever without feeling bad. But I can’t. I don’t sleep around. I don’t like to party. I’m shy asf and now I’m even more insecure than I was before. I’m terrified of guys talking to me because I think they only want one thing from me. I’m terrified to talk to girls because the friends i had slept with my boyfriend. 1 of them while I was in rehab.  Like….i guess I’m just trying to focus on my son and work. But not a day goes by I don’t regret not letting him go at the beginning. I’m no longer in my addiction and I just go home and go to work everyday. I’m sad and alone and I hope one day I’ll finally say I’ve moved on….",depression

"How to stop being miserable? I have struggled with depression since the age of 5 or 6 when I started to understand things more. Even before then, I was described as shy and struggled making and keeping friends. Everyone would take advantage of my kindness and how oblivious I was to ulterior motives. I've since learned my lessons about that, but I still try to see the best in people and try to assume they were not malicious but just oblivious.

I have noticed that little things seem to make me spiral. If I say something and it isn't heard (maybe loud background sounds, maybe I didnt speak loud enough) I can go from feeling fine to feeling worthless in an instant. While I know that the person(s) I was attempting to communicate with probably just didn't hear me, I can't help but feel as though they are ignoring me on purpose because I am not worth their time. 

I tend to be irritable in general and my good moods swing so quickly to shitty ones.. idk what to do. I can notice that I feel like shit, but I sometimes just don't understand why. It's always for stupid reasons. I hate that I don't feel confident in my worth and that I am constantly worrying about whether I am worthy to continue living or not. It's exhausting..

I've been in various therapies over 20 years, including in-patient, out-patient, group, individual, emdr for ptsd. I've learnt a lot but still feel so stunted. I've tried a handful of medications that all had negative effects on my progress and well-being. I'm at the point where I am considering self-medicating instead. 

For a long time, I dedicated my continuation to live to my cat. I got her when i was a child and she was my world. Things have gotten really hard to handle since she died and I am still struggling with it two years later. I have adopted a new kitty since then and, while I love them, I still mourn my old companion.

Even with all the good things I have in my life, I still struggle to feel or be happy. Idk if anyone will see this and idk if anyone can help me. ",depression

"Thinking about stuff Closest trans person born in 03. Over the past year or so I’ve been making peace with the fact that I’m only going to be alive for another six or seven years, and I wasn’t even taking this into account. It’s not even that I’m too miserable to be alive, even though I am miserable. I just don’t think I’m physically capable of doing what adult life would require of me in current circumstances, let alone what it’ll require in the near future. I have no energy. My bones feel like they’re made of cement. I have no self-sufficiency. Even if I somehow made it to thirty I’d probably die from eating too many TV dinners because I’d be incapable of getting up to cook for myself.

Before I started college at the start of 2022 I felt like I was gearing up for my life to make a sharp incline, like my life was mostly miserable up until then but that was where I’d finally be able to be myself and explore the world (not the globe but society), and I can’t put into words how I felt when I figured out this wouldn’t be happening.

It’s just how the universe works, I guess. There are people that are meant to thrive and prosper and do great things…and then you have people like me. That fact has also helped me come to terms with the completely incidental nature of me just existing, since I’m the product of a marriage that never should’ve happened. That’s fine.

"Struggling with depression and it all seems hopeless  Struggling with depression and it all seems hopeless 

Massively struggling with depression 

I’m 23 y/o and this feels like it has been the most difficult year of my life. 

- I have been battling with a drug and alcohol addiction, and I am managing to stay off drugs now and I am slowly lessening the drinking. 

-I have suffered two miscarriages both to a man who doesn’t want to be with me but has been there for me through a lot. 

- This man has lived with me for the past year and although it hasn’t been easy, I love his company. He is now moving out to his own place and I feel like he is going to abandon me now.

- I am really struggling with debts but I am communicating with a debt help company who are mitigating this for me and I am paying whatever I can every month to help resolve this but it just seems like a never ending cycle. 

- I work two jobs that have been on my ass due me taking a prolonged/ long period of sickness due to me being chronically ill as well as the miscarriages traumatising me both physically and mentally. 

- I have been in and out of the doctors for the past 6 months and I am currently getting psychological help for my poor mental state 

- I am very distant from my family as they are dysfunctional and contribute massively to my mental illness from when I am around them and I have distanced myself from a lot of friends this year for not respecting my boundaries.

- I live with a roommate who used to be my best friend but we are just tense with each other all the time now because she also did not respect my boundaries and has flirted/ tried it on with every guy I have been with and found out she has taken advantage of people when intoxicated as well. 

I am 23 years old and I already feel like I have massively fucked up my life, I live in an apartment I can just about afford but the debts, jobs, illnesses and everything else is all weighing on my mind and I feel like I’m dealing with it all on my own.

I’m considering a change in career path (I currently work an office job and bartend on evenings/ weekends) working in either event organisation online or becoming a tattoo artist as my current jobs make me miserable and contribute to my illnesses whereas a career change into those two would really help me mentally as they have both always been a hyper-fixation of mine.

I just feel stuck. I don’t know where to go from here.",depression
"I just want to sit down.  I had a friend recently that I loved dearly they were always happy and took my mind completely off my own thoughts. Recently that friend keeps getting yelled at by their mom and generally berated and now they just seem empty, like they seem constantly tired and she told me she even cried before school. I've tried to comfort her but it only works so much.

Seeing her this way just worsened my condition, I don't even wanna play video games (one of my previous escapes) I just sit there and look at my screen, now I just wanna sit down on the floor and do nothing I've quite litteraly lost all motivation to keep moving. How? How do I get past this? Usually there is a way to fix something but I just feel unfixable, I don't wanna fo anything i just wanna sit down.",depression
"Don't really want help anymore Been having suicidal thoughts for so long now, I lowkey don't want them to end. My life felt fuller once I said to myself ""I'll just kill myself anyway so who cares"", and going back to a state where I care about things is lame. Especially because for me, happiness is just us distracting ourselves from the sadness, so being happy is just being a naive fool",depression
"Coping mechanisms  This week has been a mess of suicide attempts but after finally getting prescribed antidepressants, im feeling hopeful and my crush just asked me to be his girlfriend so things are looking up? I currently use self harm and binge eating as a way to feel anything when my normal hobbies just leave me feeling empty :( which sort of stimulating methods do you use/suggest that i can replace these bad habits with. Im so wishing to get more help so i can continue my 7 year fight. I will do this ✨️",depression
"Crying despite the prozac This is the first time I've had a major depressive episode while steadily taking Prozac.  Life circumstances are arguably as bad as they've ever been, although plenty of people probably have the grit and fortitude to face this stuff.  Not me, I'm a wimp.  I was raised to be a wimp, to be proud of never being in a fight or hurting anyone.  I just started crying while memescrolling, which is a first for me.  Usually that and video games distracts me well enough.  I may not be long for this world.  May we all find peace.",depression
"Mixed messages from counsellors: OCD vs. Social Anxiety I'm feeling so broken. I've been mentally unwell for as long as I can remember and often this is manifested in obsessively thinking about a problem, ruminating non stop to the point where I feel sick or need to confront the problem in an at times detrimental way.
I sought emergency counseling at the school I'm currently at a couple months ago and one of the first things this person asked me was if I had been assessed for OCD. I hadn't.

I finally found a counsellor who specializes in OCD who I met in person with recently and they think that I just have social anxiety.

I was asked if I do any ritualistic things like pray or organize certain things ritualistically.... But I don't. I do ruminate non stop and am super avoidant of trauma triggers; like I won't go to my partners family dinner because I know if I do l'll obsess and ruminate about my behaviour or what I said or did for days/weeks. But this is just social anxiety? Man, idk l've been told l've have social anxiety for years... this just feels more than that. 

I also will become obsessed with people/events and spend weeks/months/years (very passively and pointlessly) instagram stalking them before bed.
Like I won't be able to sleep until I spend another 30 minutes scrolling through Liam Payne content, like hold on while I for a 5th night in a row I obsessively search for the video of him falling to see if it's been leaked (I'm not a psychopath I just can't not think about it), scroll through his whole family's Instagram, search for his high school ex gf and then view every one direction members account and their ex partners... for no reason. Now that's not social anxiety!!",depression
"What is a suicidal thought like? I am safe and I have never attempted nor do I ever intend to.

First, I smoke weed and drink everyday and I know that doesn't help, but I am talking to a psychiatrist who has me on Zoloft and therapy to wean off. And I also have TBI and PTSD from the military and depression.

But tonight I had a scary thought while high. I imagined my mother coming across me dead after an attempt. It scared me and I just kept thinking that I could never let that happen because it would destroy her. I got really emotional and started crying. Afterwards I felt good. But as I sober up I realize that that seems like a concerning thought, or am I overthinking.

It honestly made me really introspective and I need to improve my relationship with my mom. And growing up I was scared of my mom crying and being sad. 

When my psych asks if I've had suicidal thoughts or ideations, does this fall into that category.",depression
"Rapid cycling with depression? Is this a thing that can happen? 
I know it’s a common occurrence with a bipolar diagnosis, but I feel like I’ve been doing this for a few months now, but I don’t get and have never been manic/hypomanic. ",depression
Depressed  I quit drinking and smoking weed like 2.5 months ago.  I felt great for a while but now I can't seem to do anything.  I go to work and come home.  My room needs cleaned.  I don't have any friends.  I don't like my roommate.   I take a nap halfway through the day on my day off and wake up even more depressed.  I eat a lot of crap.  I've never had an a1 personality but it seemed like before all I thought about was getting drunk or getting through the hangovers and now I'm just blah.  I don't even know what to do with my time.   It so hard doing everything alone.  I've been on meds but I'm so over that.  I moved away from my family and now I feel like moving back close to them but I'm worried about bringing them into this shitshow.  I know people say just get up and do something but idk.  I have no reason to.  I started going to church and that was great at first but I'm starting to not even care about that.  I'm just tired and bored all the time.  I'm posting this because maybe someone will have advice I missed or haven't heard.  What to do?,depression
Am I depressed? Lately I've been eating a lot less and I get so bored to a point not even scrolling on my phone helps and I can't fall asleep and I always just wanna lay in bed and do nothing but I smile in front in people and am happy around people but as soon as I'm alone I'm listening to music and scrolling on TikTok and usually staying up till 4 in the morning and I just feel mentally drained but I don't act like it and my parents always tell me there's no reason for me to feel this way but idk please no hate I just wanna know if what I feeling is depression I also have suicidal thoughts sometimes and cut myself sometimes but nobody knows and I really don't know because everyone is telling me I'm fine and that I'm just a drama queen ,depression
Does anyone know what would happen  I been having a lot of suicidal thoughts the further I get along with my pregnancy the more I feel like ive failed my baby I dont want her growing up like I did and I feel like ive already failed her what would happen if I tell my doctor ,depression
"I stayed alive.... for this???? Its decided. I feel bad for my friends and loved ones, but I'm not built for this. I don't want to experience finding out what friend of mine dies of a hate crime, which family member I lose to climate disasters, who do I know is going to experience a shooting, how fucked am I going to become financially while enjoying nothing.

I'm fucking done. I have the date picked out which is far af from now, I have loved ones birthdays on every month sadly but I think I found one date that atleast a few weeks away from everyone's day and major holidays. I can prepare with this time. I always forget things at people's homes, they won't realize why I'm leaving them this time and hopefully never will.

I can slowly stop taking my meds, start drinking, refuse to sign up for medical insurance. Anything that will give me incentive when I start feeling like turning around. Because fuck that. Fuckk all of this. I called the EMTs on myself in 2015 and I regret it. I'm manifesting and taking actions to selfishly just give myself some fucking peace. ",depression
"i won‘t make it to 2025 in 3 years ive managed to build a life and watch it all fall apart again. im left with nothing. absolutely nothing. no friends, no family, no work, nothing. i cant do it anymore. i thought i had finally made it. i thought all my hard work had finally paid off. but i guess it was never meant to be, was it? i shouldve listened to the signs, i shouldve understood that all the hope i had was pointless. it felt good to live at least once, i enjoyed it. but the trauma catched up to me especially bc i still have to communicate with said trauma. ill never be able to let it go. ill never be okay. i lost too much, im too fucked up. i have no one to talk to, no one will miss me. im scared of dying, i still havent figured out how but ill have to. itll be less painful than the past 24 years have been.",depression
"I'm going to kill myself soon. I dont know if I really want to continue living.
I know that others care about me and that they would be sad if I really did it.
But I don't really care anymore.
I donr care that ""I'm too young and have so much to experience."" I don't want to experience anything anymore.
I've already written most of the letters.
I already have everything I need.
Now I'll just have to go to the place I planned where I'm gonna do it.
I'm not even sure why I'm writing this, it's not like you know me, or that you would even care.

"I've never been anymore than a burden I've never had a job, I'm 28, all the people that I know from HS or College have good jobs and are accomplishing the dreams that I wanted to accomplish but I'm here, being nothing and just  surviving because of this depression. 
I have tried to end it all but I always end up in the ICU and commited. 
Then everyone loves me, and cares about me. I try for sometime to get better, therapy, job, self care, the same old same old. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried reading atomic habits and all the self help books I can get my hands on. I've tried getting healthy, getting help, time with my loved ones. It just DOESN'T GET BETTER. 

Please tell me something that will make the switch flip and I can start living my life like everybody else. Please help, I really don't want to die, I just want to be happy. ",depression
"i know i will never ask for help, i will watch myself struggle for the rest of my life and i know i will do nothing about it. teachers always said this about me, ""never asks for help when he knows hes struggling""

"I am stranded and the quicksand is up to my neck I've ruined everything and I can't go back, I've wasted a whole year of college because I keep going in and out of this sluggish state and I don't think people realize but I'm failing so bad. It feels like everybody is moving ten times faster towards something, but I am stranded in this quicksand that is already reaching my neck.  I am always stuck, never free. 

I think of dying since I was 11, I never planned getting past 18, but then I got into the college I wanted and I am an only daughter so I didn't have the guts to go through it, to put my parents through that pain. I've lived on 2 years of borrowed time, but I don't think I can do it any longer. I can't tell my parents this though, I don't think I can tell anyone, I can't even speak about this in my native language, in English is better otherwise it gets too painful.  

I just wished they'd know that I tried really hard to be good, to make their money and time and love wasted on me worthwhile but I'm sorry I couldn't. I'm too dumb, too weak, my brain is too defective, I guess. I'm gonna miss my dogs too. 

I hope God will forgive for this, it's hurting so much and I'm sorry for my cowardice. I won't get past this Sunday, I am just trying to choose the right method, I don't want it to hurt, but surviving is not an option.",depression

This whole time so little has interested me. I feel broken. Scared. Hopeless. Exhausted. I just want to be happy. I just want to feel safe and comfortable. No matter what, I can never seem to be okay. It was never like this before. I don’t know what changed. It just all went downhill after I finished my first year of college. 

I have no purpose in life. No reason to do anything. Nothing is worthwhile and I end up dissociating and getting existential. I miss the beauty of life. The drive to feel and experience and live. It’s gone now. I can’t take it anymore. I just want to be okay. I just want my life back.

I have virtually no family and no true friends. Riding was my one passion but now I hope it kills me. I speed, drive aggressively and crowd the center line. I don’t know why I didn’t do it today. Maybe I didn’t want to ruin that guy’s day. I will keep taking chances and maybe have better luck tomorrow. ",depression

So here's my story 
Im having depression since pandamic... 

My childhood went through brutal physical abuse since i was 5yo (for acadamic excellence) By my tutor who happens to be my parent's friend, so i couldn't even complain. The abuse was so horrific, i  woukd skip school for days and weeks coz i was black and blue all over my face, back and highs and By the time I was eight, I felt completely broken. I accepted de@th with a smile and simply wanted to never exist, just so I wouldn’t have to endure that suffering again. I felt like I had no escape, no way out of that pain. and my parents never even cared my mother was always anti-fun she wont let me have friends,or go outside,  go somewhere,  or even let me play video games,  my father was never there emotionally,  we act like strangers in our own family, i never dared to confront him and he never cared... Coz we belong to poor family 
My father never spent a dime on me.. Never bought me cloths,  toys,  trips,  gadgets or for hobbies..
He only provides bare minimum to survive
This shit gives me trauma
-> I've no self respect or self esteem 
_> malnourished not even genitically gifted
_> a lot of insecurities  and a people pleaser
_>self-hatred 
_> no money no hope
_> and now i dont even have friends 
_>no one to listen to me 



And now.. Im 19 failed in my highschool (18when i failed), i was the eldest in my class by 2years andim now all of them are in college and im stuck here. 
Due to pandamic tge tutor had to leave the city for good, and due to his abusive past, studying gives me ptsds.. , i never built a studying habit and after when pandamic hit,  i grew a philosophy of self hatred "" and why the fuck i study when the earth gonna sank in the sun one day and im most likily to die before that, either by natural cause or by this evil society. ""
I was never bad in studies tho..  I would have never failed in my last exam if it wasn't for my mom..  
So what happened was our team won first trophy in football,  and when i showed that to my parents she said ""ew,  its plastic, only if it was metal we could sell it to the junk dealer"" this thing broke everything for me,  i was never gifted anything unlike other, i won prizes by myself but they were never satisfied 

Its not living anymore its just surviving... All i wish is to have a normal childhood 
Its not like i dont have goals..  I have , a lot of them in fact. but i just cant do it,  i cant even gather courage to finish this 

Edit:- i wish to add my current state,  happiness feels like a burden,  its scares me..  Coz everytime i get happy something twice bad happens  ,i was extremly happy on the last week of dec 2023, i was over the top of the world,  i knew this was coming,  2024 was hell for me, lost my first love,  my friend took her own life,  failed in exam, grandparents lost their property to a fraud lawyer,  my mother told me she's ashamed for having me,  i wants to end it all forever now 

Sry it took so long i was crying",depression
"Only Place I Can Say This I’ve been wanting to get this off my chest for a while now and feel like this is the only place where I can. I have MDD and am currently taking antidepressants and going to therapy. I feel like I am putting on band aids rather than fixing my issues. Does the medication help? Sure, but I get all sorts of brain fog and don’t feel like I ever have a clear mind. Does therapy help? Sure, but I feel like I’m wasting my time and every time I make a “breakthrough” my depression comes back with a vengeance and somehow feels worse. Then I feel like I have ZERO space to actually feel my own feelings. I feel like I have to be 100% on all the time and need to be everyone else’s support system. That’s hard to do when internally I am crumbling every second of my existence. I guess what I’m saying is I’m losing it. I’ve been suicidal before, have had suicidal tendencies, and now I feel myself slowly getting to that point again. I don’t want to hurt the few people who actually care about me but at the same time I don’t know how much more I can take this before I break. I’m going to continue putting on this mask and be the “strong one” in my relationships but I guess I just need to say that I am not ok at all and am hanging on by a thread. 

I’m not asking for sympathy or anything like that. I just needed to put this out there. ",depression
"i can’t do life anymore like a normal human being  i’m at the point now where i can’t “force” myself to be productive anymore. whenever i try to make myself study, i can’t focus for more than 5-10 minutes. i have too many thoughts in my brain that i just can’t think about anything else. i struggle with depression and people say that you just have to force yourself to do stuff. i’ve found that this just makes me even worse. like forcing myself to go to work when i’m not doing great, making myself go to school and study, stuff like that. 

so now i’m at the point in my life where no matter how hard i try and make myself do something, my brain won’t let me idk. feels like ive overworked myself for so long that my brain has decided to take an involuntary break and i can’t/don’t know how to fix it. advice is welcome or just anyone that feels the same i guess ",depression
"Do I check myself in? I am 22f and have struggled with mental and physical issues all my life. I have autism, ADHD,   major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, learning disabilities, hyper mobility syndrome, IBS, chronic pain, and possible Ehlers-Danlos/immune issues/arthritis/idk I’m sick and in pain 24/7 but never receive medical help. I also am addicted to marijuana and alcohol. I’m on a lot of medication and nothing works. I feel like I’ve tried everything and I’m so exhausted. I also study wildlife biology and after Trump’s win I worry that I may never get a job with my degree. It feels like everything I’ve been working for and neglecting my health for has been for nothing. Hell even every conservation policy since the fucking 1910s was for nothing now. I feel hopeless and that I’m only living for the happiness of others. I love my family, my dog, and my boyfriend but I am in so much mental pain all the time. I can’t appreciate them, I feel so disconnected from other people and I always felt like I’m left out. I haven’t really been consistently happy since I was 10 years old, and it’s not like I don’t try. It just can’t happen and it’s killing me. I’m a high achiever and try-hard in most things especially academics but I’m lagging behind everyone else and I can’t take it I feel awful. I also just don’t care about my own accomplishments because there’s still people better than me. It frustrates me that bad people get away with everything, like my rapist did because my school left out evidence and he had the money for a real lawyer. I love the people around me mainly but idk if I can keep going like this. I don’t want to hurt myself but I’m too depressed. I’m going to neglect my homework and lie in bed now. This helped me to write this ",depression
"i hate my life im not real i know the title seems almost exaggerated. but i'm not i can assure you. i'm only 15. i know im a kid but ive been through too much i don't know what to do.

my mum has told me twice that she wants to kill herself and told me how each way. that thought will never leave my head. it scarred me profoundly.

 i'm forced into a cult. i hate this cult and the leader but i cannot leave. this cult also happened to force a family of four and a newly wed couple to live in my house. my mum is on benefits and my dad actively doesn't choose to work because he's so sunken into this cult. the bathroom is always dirty and the kitchen too. you can imagine as 12 people live in this house.

my dad doesn't care for me, he doesn't even know my birthday. not that i care anymore, this cult has gotten to him and he hasn't been here for me since i've been born. when he does come home all he does is shout and quite frankly im sick of it.

my supposed 'best friend' has the most horrible snappy attitude swings,( i would call them mood swings but  it's just her being rude for no reason). i don't know when or why she will snap and i am always scared of that. i'm in year 11 and can't wait to leave school so that i can drop her. she actively makes me feel horrible and speaks in the most disgusting condescending tone to me. i have no real friends.

i feel the most ugly ever, all my friends get complimented and stopped randomly in school to get told how beyond gorgeous they are. me , however ? i could only dream lol. i hate every single body part of me from my horrendous teeth to my body to my nose. i wish i could afford braces but i can't. i want to go to the gym but i have no money. and my area is the worst area to live in london and you could only imagine when it gets dark. when i walk home from school i speed walk and i dont look at my iphone camera in fear of seeing my disgusting face staring back. 

i am in a constant state of derelasation and wish for God to take me. i am muslim so i asked God to take me in sujood. i can't do this anymore. when it gets bad i just stare at paracetamol, waiting for it to stare back. I feel like there's something wrong with me and i need help. ",depression

"It's no use. Not anymore.  I ruined everything. I know it to. 

This isn't anything but for self reflection if anything ever came to mind. 

Overview:
     My name is Victor. I am at the moment 20. I don't know for how long wether that be because im gone or I actually reached my birthday, surprisingly. It's almost been a year since I've grasped the fact that I am a burden. I'm a burden to my Mother who I've always butted head with since I was a child. She actively keeps telling me over and over how she was in my life when she clearly wasn't. She always chose Men and substances over taking care of me. Even with my biological father. I've also lived with my Grandmother until a few months ago, 4, I believe. When I got my tattoo on my right arm she noticed and decided to kick me out. I've lived with her for almost 16 years straight until then. She is an immigrant from Poland that is very hypocritical and verbally abusive. As is my mother being both physically when I was a child, but emotionally/verbally up til now. My mother lives with my ""step father"" that is an absolute pos. I never knew my biological father until I was 17 years old. Although he has his own kid. And I truly believe he wouldn't care if I disappeared either. He has his own life and has has one without for 14 years. 

Sophomore Year of HS:
    Up till this point my mother has never done anything like this. She was physically and erotically abusive growing up, but on a vacation for a week with my Mother and Grandmother, she met this guy. He was an absolute red flag. That same night at the Hotel. My mother would visit him and they went out. 2 days after the vacation we got home, my mother and grandmother had a fight. With that my Mother returned back to the state we visited to the guy. 

     For 3 weeks, No contact, no messages, nothing. They were gone for 3 weeks around the Midwest partying high on substances, booze, and whatever else. It was a whole mess the day she came back out of nowhere with that guy. I was 16 I believe. Or 15. And cops had to be called on her. Some time went by and there were still problems. But things severally sorted out. But during her 3 week bender, I first became very suicidal. I would try hurting myself just because I had nightmares seeing my mother in such a violent and scary/high state. I still have them to this day. 

More recently:
     The past year before I met my best friend. I grasped and came to the absolute conclusion that I'm dead right on. I am a burden. I'm a burden to my ""family"". My mother and Grandma both have said its better I if I didnt exist. My mother says having me was a mistake because it kept her from enjoying her youth as she was a young mother at the age of 20. My grabdma says i betrayed her for getting a tattoo, and since living  with my mom for 4 momths, i havent taoked her once. My father has his own life and i dont even talk with him often.

 I'm a burden to my ""friends"". I see nyself only being incited out of pity. Ans thats okay. I dont blame then for replacing me. Both current and old friend groups. I push away my best friend. Over and over. I scare her, Im awkward. She says im a good and sweet person, but im not. I'm an awful person that causes people problems. 

I am the problem. Therapy hasn't helped. It's taken me down more and more a worse spiral. When I was in a relationship, I didn't tell the girl at the time before the end, but I've been dealing with depression 2 months before we split.

 I heavily think about suicide. It's gotten so bad I made a list of things I own and to whom to give it to. It's been 4 months since my depression has come back, as I stated before. I started with plastic razors from work. On my arms and left knee. I've tried to control it though and use my keys instead. Less damage. I sleep anywhere I can that isn't my house whenever I can. I hate it at home with my Mother and step ""father."" That's pos. I don't even eat anymore. And when I do, I throw it up between asap-2hrs after. I can't take food. 

I'm not mentally well and I know that. I haven't been for a long time. But even if I wanted to seek ""further help."" I can't afford it. Especially since I put myself if awful fucking debt. I want to just abadon everything. ",depression
"I think I’m depressed and it’s weird for me So I’m a pretty solid guy id say I graduated high school worked hard and bought a car for myself, and got into the college I wanted. But like the second half of my senior year I started smoking and it’s been often since then, and I don’t have many friends here in college besides my roomate and like 3 others but me and my roomate are the closest. My friends are back home so it is what it is. I came to like realization when like walking back to my rooms from class it was a long and nice walk, but like I’m just like down and I’m not even like frowning it’s just that I’m like just upset in general or not happy about something. I used to swim and stuff and be active but I stopped after the season ended, I do pushups and calisthenics just to be ok, I started again cus I’ve not done shit for a while. I’ve always been a positive happy guy and I go with it taking the blows procrastinating and doing it at the last minute like I always do, but that’s when my best work comes out. But as of recent like I just don’t feel like I belong or like that if I wasn’t around nobody would even mind or they would just say like he’s a weird guy type of stuff. I was always a little different and everyone did know cus I was bothered about it a bunch in my young life, but I guess my spirit is like broken now I’m quiet, it’s hard to like meet people for me I get nervous and I can’t talk to girls even tho they seem to like me. Like I freeze up and just don’t know what to say it’s like a shock I guess I’m inexperienced. I’m just lost right now but at least I have my car I like driving around at night in the deep woods with music it’s satisfying I can be free with no eyes just me.  But this depression is weird to me because like I’m not physically upset but in my head  it’s upsetting I’m just lost and don’t know how to proceed here in my new college life. Thank you for reading I haven’t ever said stuff like this and I came to a realization that I’ve been hovering over and I wanna fix it.",depression

I have a hard time being productive and whenever a small inconvenience happens, I overreact and give up.

"This is going to be the end  I plan on ending my life tomorrow. I have been suicidal for many years now, I’d say at least 16 years, and have never committed a serious attempt but I believe I’ve hit my limit. The election results have really pushed me over the edge, there truly is no hope for a better future with the state the country is in. I have a few friends that aren’t republican but other than that everyone around me is a Trump lover. My immediate family all make fun of me for being a democrat and I have no support from them as a gay woman. My friends have tried to be supportive in the past but there is nothing they can really do. I have never really felt like I belonged in the friend group and the past few times we’ve hung out, I’ve really felt the disconnect. I feel like they just drag me along since we’ve known each other since elementary school, but I just can’t measure up to them. 

I am a failure and a let down. A true loser with no skills or dreams. I never expected to live this long, I basically just shut down and floated through life doing the bare minimum. I can barely work a part-time minimum wage job and lately I can’t even get through my pathetic 4 hour shift without breaking down crying multiple times. I am a complete idiot who can’t figure out how to do anything. I have no drive, no motivation. There is nothing I can do to make a real living so I will always be a burden to those around me. I’ve never had a dream job or even a remote idea of something I would be good at. I am incredible anxious and nervous and second guess everything I do. I have no confidence and can’t get out of my own head. There is really no field I could be in. I’ve thought about just selling my soul and working for Amazon but I wouldn’t even be able to do that right. I’m too slow and lazy, any hours my job now gives me is basically charity. 

I just want it all to be over. You can say hang in there and have hope, but I truly think I’m beyond that. The only reason I haven’t tried to kill myself yet is because I’m too lazy to put in the effort to do it right. I don’t want anyone to catch me and stop me and I don’t want to have a failed attempt that leaves me unable to complete another. I do not understand people that look at the world and think things are going to be okay, I really don’t. 

I’ve tried therapists to no avail. I just shut down and don’t talk and I can’t afford them anyway. I’ve tried over 20 medications and nothing helps, most make me feel worse. Last year was my first hospitalization (I put myself in) and that made me lose what little hope I had of ever getting better. Nothing there was helpful, the whole experience was just traumatizing. I am already on Medicaid (probably gonna lose that coverage with the new administration) so my options for help were already limited. I don’t understand how to do anything and I hate phone calls to the point where I will just freeze and be unable to speak so getting help feels impossible. I don’t know how to help myself and I have little to no support so it all just feels like a dead end. 

So….in the morning when hopefully everyone has left the house or is asleep still, I will either hang myself from a support beam or take the remainders of all the medications I’ve been put on in the past (a least a dozen different antidepressants that all have between 1-3 months worth of pills). I know it won’t be pretty, I know it’s gonna hurt, I know it’s gonna devastate the few people that claim to love me. But I just….I can’t get better. I can’t live in a world that values hatred and greed over love and equality. 

If you’ve read this far, thanks I guess, and sorry for bumming you out. ",depression

"I genuinely want to die 
My boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me a month and a half ago. It was sudden and violent as I was blindsided. I moved to another country to live in the same city as him after we had been kind of long distance for a year. I moved first, faced many hardships as I didn’t have anything, no money, no job, no friends. I was there for 4 months when he finally moved there too, I had started my first job. We didn’t live together, he didn’t want to and me either. But then as time went on I kept on getting pressured by friends asking when we’d be moving in together, which created conflicts in our relationship. He was scared of the future and didn’t know why. Then I got laid off, was unemployed for a month, then started a new job for two months, very toxic and got fired. I’m convinced I fell into a depression and I had to write my master’s thesis and I was extremely stressed. Comes the time to defend that thesis, I go back to my home country to do so and he was coming the weekend after, he saw my family, spent the night with me at my sister’s and the next day, a few hours before we had to go back to our home, he broke up with me in a park.

He told me he felt disconnected and that maybe he had fallen out of love (romantically).
The next day he told me that he was scared of trying to fix our relationship, that he didn’t want us to hurt each other and that it would take too long to work on it. Then a few days later he said he didn’t want to be in a relationship, that he realised he wasn’t ready to commit, that he couldn’t date anyone and that he wouldn’t until he was ready to commit.

I’ve been heartbroken and I was so confused. A friend of mine invited me to her place and I went there, the city where I met him, where we started our romance, where I gave him the choice to date and where he told me I love you for the first time.

It’s been hard… and after 5 days I broke no contact to get clarification.

We had a call. He said he fell out of love 2 years ago, love for him means commitment, so in that sense he doesn’t love me anymore. He said he forced himself to commit thinking that he needed to do that to be happy, and to make me happy. He said he is attracted and has feelings for me but that he cannot commit and it has nothing to do with me but everything to do with him. He said he feels lighter now, that he’ll work on himself alone until he’s ready to give relationships another shot. He’s sad we met before then, he wished we could have met when we were at the same point in life. He misses me, our times together, our intimacy, my presence.

But he told me he doesn’t want me to wait for him, that he doesn’t want to give me false hope. But he hopes we can stay cordial and maybe become friends in the future…

I’m so sad, so broken. I won’t find someone like him, we were so in sync about so many ideas. I’m convinced he was the right and only one for me…

We met 2 weeks later, he contacted me to ask if I was still up for meeting before going to a concert we had planned on going to. We met the day before the concert.

It was very scary, it hurt because he seemed so fine with the break up. He got overwhelmed by my speaking about emotions. He didn’t want me to talk about how I felt and to ask about how he felt. He got so overwhelmed he wanted to run away.

He told me he had felt unhappy because he felt like he wasn’t himself in the relationship, that he had to change to be with me. He told me he always felt tense whenever we talked about emotions and our feelings, whenever I tried communicating with him. He never felt 100% happy because of the tension. And he finally feels like himself again now that he’s single.

I never asked him to change, I loved him as he was. He told me none of it was my fault. That I didn’t do or say anything wrong. That the problem was him but that he didn’t know why he felt that way with me.

I feel so horrible, I love him so much and yet he chose to walk away.

I saw one of his friends’ stories on Monday and they were at a reggaeton concert (he doesn’t listen to reggaeton), he was all dressed up (he never listened to me when I was giving him advice on how to dress up but now he’s taking care of his appearance), he was dancing and having fun with people he has only known for a year and a half, some even less while he walked away from me after 3 years.

I realise how immature he is emotionally but I’m just so confused by how he could just stop loving me, how he could walk away like that, how he could lie for 2 even 3 years. Why never communicating with me? Everything was solvable. I only wanted us to grow together.


Everyone tells me he will regret it, that he will come back but I doubt it… and that hurts.

Why didn’t he talk with me? Why couldn’t he work on the relationship like I was? Was I so bad?

It’s already been 2 months and yet it doesn’t hurt any less, I feel even worse… I want to disappear, I want to die and stop feeling so miserable ",depression

But I don’t know under it all there’s nothing. Like  I have plenty of “friends” but I don’t have anyone that messages me or asks me to meet.

" 26 and Feeling Completely Lost—Another Career Switch and Falling Further Behind Hi, everyone,

I’m not really sure where to start. I’m 26, and while I know that’s not “old,” it feels like my life is slipping away in this endless cycle of second-guessing and starting over. My friends and peers are all out there building careers, buying homes, hitting these life milestones, and I’m here… still figuring out what I’m even supposed to be doing with my life.

I already have a degree in Biomedical Sciences and have tried so many different paths—medicine, dentistry, even computer science. Each time I think I’ve found something that fits, it turns out I’m wrong, or I start questioning it. I’m passionate about applying technology to health in meaningful ways, and I have these dreams of working in biotech engineering, maybe even making advancements in nanotechnology or machine learning. But the reality is I’m just not there. I’m nowhere. And every new decision just feels like another way to fall behind.

Meanwhile, my friends are moving forward like clockwork. They’ve found their niches, they’re thriving, and I can’t help but feel left behind, like I don’t belong or I’m failing at some fundamental level. I don’t even know how to start “catching up” because every choice feels wrong in some way. It’s exhausting, and I feel like I’m just on the outside, looking in, waiting for something to click that never does.

Does anyone here know this feeling? How did you get out of it, if you ever did? Because right now, it feels like I’m stuck in a hole I can’t dig myself out of. Thanks for listening. I’m just hoping someone out there gets it.",depression

"My life sucks & I'm done. I'm emotionally drained. I've been crying for a really long time with all kinds of suicidal thoughts running though my head.
 I (F27), have a chronic illness called cystinuria, they are the rarest type of kidney stones and are made from the cystine in your kidneys (which my Dr tells me are essentially crystals). I pass stones every. fucking. day. I'm talking anywhere between 1-10. They won't always be big stones but all of them hurt nonetheless. 
Yesterday, I had to do eswl (shockwave) treatment, which is where you lay down on a bed, and they put on a machine that shocks you for an hour, IN HOPES that it breaks down the kidney stone (AND BTW, they don't even give you so much as a damn Panadol pill for it either!), because I had a stone which was 6x9cm. 
Since then, I've been passing a lot more stones, which is good because it means it worked, but its fucking horrible cos I'm in constant pain. No pain meds work, Drs are telling me to suck it up, and I recently got out of a relationship so I can't really call him or any friends for help cos idk how to ask for it and I'm a pathetic idiot who distances herself when shit in life is hard. 
I turned to my family instead and, on our family group chat, said how bad I was feeling, mind you, the conversation before this was how bad the weather was cos it rained today. My brother, (M29) went on to stay making jokes about what I'm going through. Nobody else says anything at this time. After a bit of back and forth with him, he made a poll on the chat, which was, again, a joke towards me, and my dad (M... 60 something) starts reacting to his jokes and plays along. He (dad) then changes the conversation entirely (he's abroad rn) to see if my mom (F.. 60 something too) was okay because of the rain. 
After that, it's like I didn't exist. 
They got along all chatting together about how they are and what they're doing, my sister sends a picture of my niece, all is well in their little family.
 And I'm left heartbroken thinking wtf is it gonna take for someone to give a shit about me. 
I'm alone in my apartment, nobody around me, lightheaded from crying, family doesn't give a shit, in fucking pain and not able to move. 

All I want to do is kill myself and be done with this stupid fucking life. I'm sick of all of this. 

Anyways, I told them none of them gave a shit about me and left the chat. Now all of them are trying to message with how much they care and how I should have messaged first and gave excuses on why they didn't check in. 

I think I'm gonna end my life tonight, I just don't want to leave my cat alone. He's all that I have. :( ",depression

I think I had this class for 2-3 years, but each time,for a couple of weeks, the class had to run around the school 4-8 times. It varied each class time. At the beginning I use to run but I couldn’t exactly keep up with my classmates. Plus whenever they passed by me they’d laugh at the way I ran or the fact I was tired. So, I would only run when they couldn’t see me. I guess they took this as me not running at all and would be annoyed that they had to wait for me to go inside. Even when I ran they still had to wait for me. There were a couple of times when others would get impatient and yell at me to run. I wanted to cry so bad because I felt that no matter what I did I was in the wrong in their eyes. I felt sick that my teacher say that I was struggling but never took me to the side to possibly work something out knowing I complete the task like everyone else or just to even ask me what was wrong. It’s not like she couldn’t hear what my classmates were saying.

What’s wild is that since college I love to walk/run. But since I’m currently not in the best mindset I haven’t been doing it for a while. I’ve always been someone who worries about what others think of me and it hurts that my classmates viewed me in that way not knowing that I would try but I physically could not keep up with them.

"This past year has been hard for me. Maybe I’m soft or just not built for this Started the year off suffering a serious injury that’s kept me disabled. My mother is currently in a home where she is quickly declining, and I watched the final moments of my grandmother’s life as she struggled to breathe her last few breaths. 

On a regular day I’m pretty lonely I live alone, haven’t even dated anyone since 2016. For a while this summer I felt good emotionally because I thought wow having a compassionate President that understands the struggles of caring for a sick family member.

"My father’s family ruined mi life and I don’t know how to be happy again. Hello everyone, this is my story. I’m 22F… I live with my family in an apartment made in my grandma’s house. This was the BIGGEST mistake my father made. Basically, he has a bad relation with his parents (my grandpa died, but my mothers still here). My grandma, is the worst person I ever met. When I was a child, she always said to me bad things about my mother, my father, about myself! Or she hugged my other cousins or gave gifts to them in front of me, and to me nothing (even a hug). Or when I wanted to say hello to her, she literally ignored me and continued walking. Imagine this situation, living in the same house with this person, and as a child, she ruined me. I always asked myself what did I did wrong? I was a very kind child, I never disrespected her or ignored her even though she never loved me. Now I’m 22 and still live in the same house. We always wanted to make the division of the house making an apart  entrance but she doesn’t want!!!!! I don’t know WHY.  I’m tired of this, I don’t want to leave house because I don’t want to see her and to listen or see things that make me feel sad, I can’t invite my boyfriend because she or her fucking family say bad things, my mother too. She married very young and my father was working most of the time… people here including my grandma, makes our life miserable and full of sadness",depression

My mother constantly tells me that she loves me and all of that bullshit, and then she just says every problem in HER life its my fault, its been a few months like this now and i cant afford it anymore, ive even got an eating disorder (idk if it has a name or if its even an eating disorder at all, basically i go days without taking anything and other days where i will eat anything thats on my way) no one in my family cares, thats if i could call them a family of course, im considering trying an overdose at my job to see if anybody would at least ask me if im okay after i survive (ive tried overdosing myself like 5 times at this point, so im sure af im gonna survive) not to mention i got an infection in my big toe that if i dont treat soon doctors told me im going to lose my whole leg, and i dont give a fuck, because i think being in a wheelchair for the rest of my life will make me more special that just being who i am, i dont care anymore, i just dont, if u want to try and talk with me i probably wont respond because im at my job right now, but if u want to spread some happiness its apreaciatted that someone at least pretends to care about me, thats way more that every single person around me",depression
"26 and Feeling Completely Lost—Another Career Switch and Falling Further Behind Hi, everyone,

I’m not really sure where to start. I’m 26, and while I know that’s not “old,” it feels like my life is slipping away in this endless cycle of second-guessing and starting over. My friends and peers are all out there building careers, buying homes, hitting these life milestones, and I’m here… still figuring out what I’m even supposed to be doing with my life.

I already have a degree in Biomedical Sciences and have tried so many different paths—medicine, dentistry, even computer science. Each time I think I’ve found something that fits, it turns out I’m wrong, or I start questioning it. I’m passionate about applying technology to health in meaningful ways, and I have these dreams of working in biotech engineering, maybe even making advancements in nanotechnology or machine learning. But the reality is I’m just not there. I’m nowhere. And every new decision just feels like another way to fall behind.

Meanwhile, my friends are moving forward like clockwork. They’ve found their niches, they’re thriving, and I can’t help but feel left behind, like I don’t belong or I’m failing at some fundamental level. I don’t even know how to start “catching up” because every choice feels wrong in some way. It’s exhausting, and I feel like I’m just on the outside, looking in, waiting for something to click that never does.

Does anyone here know this feeling? How did you get out of it, if you ever did? Because right now, it feels like I’m stuck in a hole I can’t dig myself out of. Thanks for listening. I’m just hoping someone out there gets it.",depression
"Pathetic This could be the last night of my life. I hope so. As I was cleaning my face earlier, I told myself that given the state of my skin, it wasn't very useful. And then I mentally listed the things that have always made it difficult or impossible for others to love me. I accumulate everything that makes a human being repulsive and it screws me up, because I'm full of love. I know that love exists because of all the love inside me. Dying is perhaps the only proof of love I can offer my family; to stop being a burden or a chore. I'm exhausted from fighting with my body and mind. To be alone and worthless. Nothing makes sense. I can't even cry. The whole thing is ridiculous. If anyone read this, sorry for wasting a few minutes of your life. I don't even know if my english is right. It doesn't really matter ",depression
"Damn it hits me now I have purposed my whole life for education and strict life.

Where fun is no part of. I cant keep my guard down. Never. If i let it down slighly i can fail everything.

In doing so i never experienced love. Im scared i never will. Im getting old 24m. Im ugly and poor also. So i dont see any chance anymore.

In doing so i got to porn. Where im now addicted heavly. I cant stop

I failed my life. I failed everything in my life. 

- I dont have a good income despite doing so good on school and being almost a bachelor degree.
I have changed course 3 times, now i think im at the right track. So i lost so much time studing things i will mostly not do

- My mind is corrupt by porn

- never went on a date. I never had a gf in my life. 
  Prostitute give me the chance in april to touch her or else i wouldnt had ecperience that. 
But im still virgin

- im weak, i dont take risks. Because if i do something im thinking about all possible outcome and if the negative one is to bad. I stop and dont the thing

You know wgat the modt bad part is. I dont have purpose in my life anymore.

Im living for myself, i dont want kids.
I want a gf only so i cant satisfy myself. Im not gonna lie, its about the sex. I want sex only. 

Im scared to fall in love, i dont know how i will be. I dont know hiw she will be. Im not preoared for a relationship and i dont think i ever will be. No one is going to date a ugly poor stinky dude.

So sex is the only thing i want from a woman then.
I sound bad but thats my intension.

Im so sorry if i failed amyone in my life. It was never my intention to do so. Life didnt go as i thaught or planned. 

I said to myself i will never be jealous of someone else. Yet a fellow student who is younger than me took all the risk and is doing a lot better in another country where i wanted to go to. He can get any girl he wants.
He did everything i wanted to do in my life. But still im happy for him. 

In my life i dont need much lol

- good income
- good health with good healthcare
- a tiny house is all good im just one person
- sex

I dont live in usa
I dont wanna tell all i can say is im living in south america.

"Therapist Distracted During Session. What Do I Do? At the beginning of our session today, I heard the sound of my therapists text notification go off multiple times. This is not uncommon, and he will typically say “Whoops. Let me put that on Do Not Disturb” or something. I think the phone is connected to his laptop in some way. I was in the middle of answering a question he asked me and it is SO HARD to be vulnerable. I heard the sound of an iPhone message being sent. There were several incoming and outgoing text messages over the next few minutes, and his eyes frequently shifted back and forth between me and his screen and he was typing. I eventually had his undivided attention for the rest of the session, but I completely shut down. 

I feel so unimportant. So embarrassed for being vulnerable today, and all the times in prior sessions. I feel so stupid for any thought I’ve ever had that lead me to believe we are a team and is attuned. 

I’m a big fawner. I’d have a hard time addressing this. Part of me wants to just move on like nothing ever happened, and just ghost if it ever happens again. Another part of me wants to confront him maybe in an email and say “this is what you did and this is how I feel” but I’m a big fawner and don’t think I would. 

I also can’t imagine any other scenario besides showing up next week with all this hurt and shame and being completely unable to engage in therapy. 

I’m in therapy for trauma. A lot of relational trauma. IYKYK.

"i haven't been myself for months and nobody's noticed hello. major tw for suicide and that sort 
october 2nd, i attempted suicide. i very nearly lost my life if i kept going for another twenty seconds. it was by far my most serious attempt, but nobody knows. i haven't been myself for months before that, but that day really killed something within me. it didn't take my life but it took everything else away from me. i feel so dissociated from reality and i often find myself questioning that maybe i did die that day and im just a ghost floating around. i don't feel real at all. i feel like im just a body with nothing else left in it. depression has been beating my ass for so long now. i think im going to end up in hospital again soon. as the days go by im getting worse and worse at hiding how im really feeling and people are starting to notice. i spend all day every day in bed. ive got out of bed about five times today and that's it. i was meant to go to school but i didn't. i couldn't. i haven't been able to go for weeks now. somehow my parents haven't noticed anything yet. i don't know how. all the warning signs are there. i spend all day just waiting for the day to be over so i can go back to sleep. every night i sleep an average of 13 hours with naps during the day as well. it's the only way i can escape this feeling. i can barely take care of myself anymore. ironically enough a year ago today i first attempted suicide. maybe that's just set the tone for today, i don't fucking know. everyday just looks the same to me now. i couldn't point out one unique thing that's happened over the past two weeks. god im so tired. my mum's literally said to me ""you've been sleeping so much yet you still look exhausted"". god i don't know if she's just hoping it's not gotten bad again or she genuinely can't see it, but the signs are so obvious. i love my parents to bits but im genuinely shocked they haven't asked me how im doing because i can't hide it anymore. im not blaming them, but i just don't know how else to ask for help. im so tired.",depression
"It's exhausting being depressed At this point I just can't comprehend if I'm being lazy or my life is actually overwhelming. I have to convince myself that I have a good life because there is a lot of people out there I'm worse conditions.

I feel loved by friends and family, I have no enemies, I have an S.O and 2 dogs, but everyday i have to tell myself I love them back without knowing if I'm telling the truth. I've embodied a persona capable of saying what needs to be said to avoid conflict, but all the time I just want to be alone, be free from doubt, free from comparison. I don't want be better or worse than anyone, i don't want to be judged.

Working in any position has become a burden, I don't believe in what I'm doing, I just do it because I'm paid, and I spend most of the time working under unnecessary pressure because of someone else's dysfunctional agenda. I've lost all pleasure I had in work because of that, and it even drains my energy to do any hobbies.

I daydream constantly of the moment I'll be able to take my own life, how far I need to be from everyone, how can I disappear, if I want to say anything, if I want to blame someone, if I can take that pain. It's frustrating that I'm even unmotivated to end my own life.

In the end I think I'm just miserable and resentfull, and won't be happy until I make everyone feel the same, this twisted sense of justice. It's either that or just internalizing and dying with it.",depression
"Just thoughts to release I don't really know why I decided to write here and my best guess is that I just need to tell someone how I feel who is not part of my life.

I just feel tired, which is the most cliché feeling in the context of depression I suppose.  
In past months or maybe years, I am not sure anymore, it feels more and more difficult to keep my aimiable happy persona up and running.

Let me tell you a bit about what I am like:

People at work or outside of my close family think of me as an strong extrovert, which I am not. I just learned to act as such really well since I was a teenager, and while it is exhausting it is a part of me. It is not that I am hiding it. In fact I tell people I am an introvert, though most simply don't believe me or give me looks of good humored scepticism. That comes with a slew of difficulties that are hard to make people relate to.

Once upon a time I had so much energy at work and private life too, which is now a convincing facade only.  
My drive to work is gone.  
I am just waiting for people to notice how I am failing at doing my work on the level I would expect of myself. I keep getting praised though, by my boss and my teammates too.

That positive feedback just feels empty and hollow because it only shows that nobody truly cares enough about my work to notice that I am only at 40% of what I could do.

And no, this is not impostor syndrome. I am old enough and professionally experienced enough to judge my own performance sufficiently. It is at bare bones what I do.

Everything I do feels pointless too quickly. I feel anger too quickly too, aber all kinds of things, but that anger boils up ferociously inside my head for a few seconds and then it just deflates, making me feel defeated and as if I just want to lie down and stay there.

Then the feeling of realisation comes that I can't do that, because I have to function.  
For my kids, wife, and my own future.  
Which leaves me feeling even more defeated because I do not have a choice.

My hobbies were strong once and I enjoyed them.  
When I listen to audiobooks or read novels these days my brain just highlights what is bad about the writing and how boring the characters are and so on. Even when its actually a good book. Same for movies and any other entertainment like computer games. It all feels hollow so fast.

And speaking of hollow: This word keeps encompassing so much more.  
It is like the everyday things which are not purely practical feel that they only have meaning because other people decide to give them meaning. And I have to fulfil the expectation of that other people meaning all the time. I am not talking about special fancy things, but rather just everyday normal things like smalltalk, how I look, how well I do what I do.

The thing I care most for are my kids and for them I accept all of it and anything.  
In this I have no hollowness but just simple determination and love.  
Yet I dissapoint myself in parenting too often as well.

Parenting is hard and challenging and I know this. I also know that compared to many I am doing it very well, and I don't care that I do well, because again I see all things I do badly as if under a magnification. In a spiral down, usually.

Back to the flares of unwarranted anger, it also comes with odd petty thoughts of aggression.  
When I see dogpoop on the pavement I suddenly have flashes of hyper agressive visions of how I would punish the person who just lets their dog poop there not at all caring about others.  
Or when I see a car speeding in a sideroad where Kids always go to and from school I catch myself imaging how I throw a stone at their windshields and how I slam their faces to the ground if they dare step out.... and it's truly frustrating and sad to have such thoughts that I don't really want to do, while a part of me does.

I find myself wishing I didn't exist to just remove it all, and then feel horrible about the mere thought because I most certainly would never let my kids suffer me not being with them. I will never leave them in the pain of loss and I will always be there for them, until they no longer need me and decide to leave towards their own future.

I still don't know why I wrote all of the above and it all feels so inadequate and full of gaps, incomplete and lacking that I just feel more sad.

Even worse is knowing that based on the social strandards I know, see and experience I should not be like this. So many have truly worse situations. Really. I have an objectively good and safe live. A loving family that I don't want to ever let down because they are great.

Well, there is no real point or conclusion to all this I can offer anyone who reads these last lines.

If you actually read all of what I wrote: That was nice of you. Thanks.",depression

I can’t even take care of myself. my mom would always say that it’s the most basic thing ever yet somehow I can’t even do that, then what can I do. I tried to tell her I didn’t have any energy or motivation but I couldn’t say it in a way that made sense. she just hit me that it’s something that doesn’t need motivation or energy and proceeded to force me to shower on a daily basis. it sounds so tiring. having to do chores the moment I come back from school feels so draining and tiring already. I know that showering is literally personal hygiene. I don’t understand why it’s so hard for me either.

I don’t even know how to reach out. I can’t get a single word out, especially in my native language - I’m so much more used to expressing my feelings in english, and even then I can’t do it that well in english either. I don’t even know how I feel, I keep on running and running. I don’t understand whatever goes on in my head. occasionally I’d feel an intense urge to sob and a throbbing pain in my head, throat and chest, but I don’t know why.

even when I do try to reach out, more often than not I feel ignored. and then I wouldn’t even know what to say.

these days, I keep on getting thoughts of self harm too. I haven’t tried, I brushed those thoughts off, but that doesn’t mean they’re gone.

Everything I've always wanted. But I'm glad all the same knowing that maybe it's possible for me to be happy even if it's not this universe. I'll die, maybe soon, in my cold bedroom but in another universe this death will be mourned. Or maybe, me gathering enough courage to finally do it will be another ""good-ending"" in itself.

"The results of my silent attempt got me compliments  28yoF. I had a attempt yesterday. Learned a lesson on thinner ropes causing more pain and a lesson on my own pain tolerance. It left quite a few marks. Eventually, I had to go to work. I fashioned a little choker necklace out of some ribbon scraps to hide the marks. I don't wear makeup. Don't even own any. So, that was kind of my only option.

I was at work for a few hours when I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and realized I had a ton of broken blood vessels all over my face. Mostly around my eyes, high on my cheeks, and down around my jaw. Maybe at a certain distance they look like freckles enough? Maybe, it just like of makes my face look pinker and kinda flushed or childlike? At least I was hoping so. Hoping no one got close enough to realize they weren't cause it was pretty severe.

I've never gotten compliments on my appearance in the 6 months I've been at my job. I don't wear makeup cause depression. On top of that, last night was super slow which is typical for Tuesday night. Comparatively, during weekends, I have 6-8 times as many customers. Last night, I had 3 different instances of people making comments on how beautiful I was. And not just a single comment either. Like it became the topic of the small talk we exchanged for a bit. 

I don't know if it was the choker necklace making me just look better or if the ""freckles"" complimented my face so well that people really perceived me as beautiful at such a higher rate than normal (normal rate being zero). Those were the only things that changed though. Except maybe being unable to smile or engage well with people because I am so terribly unable to muster it. 

It was just so weird to be faced with compliments that I couldn't help but feel came from the side effects of an attempt. To look people in the face and thank them for the compliment when they were unknowingly motivated by the physical manifestation of all of my pain and suffering.

 Idk why I'm even writing this. Maybe just a reminder that you have no clue what is going on in people's lives. I swear I don't mean to sound concieted- ""Oh, how dare people say I'm beautiful?!"" It was just a hard experience for me to reconcile and I can't stop thinking about it.",depression
"Had to get it of my chest M 14,i want to kill myself,recently everything is going in the wrong direction l, lost both of my best friends because  i am an alcoholic. school is no different, i know that it started recently but it’s giving me a kind of stress and anxiety that i never experienced before. i cant focus on shit because i cant process that i lost my best friends for this bullshit, ive been waiting for something to change for a while but nothing seems to. it’s the first time of my life that i seriously thought about it… i feel useless and i don’t feel like living, when i have free time i just don’t do nothing and i don’t like doing anything in particular. recently i have not been looking like myself  from a few months ago mentally and physically. the only thing that i think about is suicide and it’s scenarios.
death is the thing that i fear the worst but we have to overcome our fears at least one time in our lifetime.

"Bringing up the topic of medication I have struggled for quite a bit, and with a bit I mean my whole life. I've for most of my life tried to ""fix"" myself on my own but I have in the past and now as well reached out for help. Problem with my brain is that sometimes I wanna be better and sometimes not, it's kinda weird. Like yes of course I wanna be better in general but it's like I give up, I suppose that would be the ""hopelessness"" part of depression. But you know, it does make even trying in therapy even harder, it's like whenever I'm given a solution or even a treatment-plan I just feel hopeless. I feel like nothing will work, it worries me a lot because like ME/I want to get better but my brain doesn't let me. I've thought about how it is with medication, I don't know how it would help me in the long-run but I feel like it possibly could help me get kickstarted into my treatment journey or that's at least what I've heard from other depressed people. It's just I don't know how to bring it up to my therapist, I don't wanna seem desperate to have medication because I'm scared I'll be denied of it. But I also feel like in the state of mind that I have right now, I don't know how I would get better because it feels like my brain or whatever controls me more than I. Maybe I just need to fight harder but I honestly don't even know how, most of my energy every day goes to my anxiety and feeling panicky over everything. ",depression
"It’s been a rough day so far and it’s barely noon  I’m just going through it lately, time slows way down and it’s like I move in slow motion I just started therapy for the first time and I’m realizing Il never really fix the problem I can just heavily medicate and hope for the best. 

Im surrounded by most of my triggers and can’t really get out on my own in my area as prices for an apartment is as much as a house. I feel like I get worse by the day usually comes harder at night and as of the last week I’ve been up for most hours of the night dealing with intrusive thoughts that Il stay up fact checking for hours. Im just done dealing with it.

I’m good at nothing and don’t have much to live for, I have a son who’s 6 months old he’s amazing and I feel like he deserves better then me, and I know my wife can do so much better then me. I don’t have any valuable skills to take me anywhere, I never went to college because of financial difficulties and I feel like I can’t possibly be good enough for her. Never been to any parties or had the financial means to have one for myself so that in of itself is a trigger on its own. It’s like I bring up the past the second my brain wants to have fun and makes me feel worthless, and more importantly left out. I can’t possibly relate to anyone who has a decent upbringing and/ or just got to go to college. I just don’t have it in me for another day I’m jealous and compare myself to people I don’t even know, because I firmly believe that they are better then me and/ or better off then I ever was 

Some of these guys were financially better off then at 18 then I am currently at 25 just becuase they come from a rich family with better/ more opportunities given to them.

"My whole existence is a failure Hey hm, I’ve read many posts on Reddit but I’ve never actually written anything because it felt too much like exposing myself out to the world.

I turned 23 a couple of weeks ago and I’m just starting to feel the years catching up to me. To put it simply, I have failed at everything in my life. I stopped going to school regularly starting at the end of primary school and I skipped 2 whole years of school and ended up dropping out officially at 16 (the legal age you can drop out in France).

I’ve moved at least 30 times over my lifespan starting at the age of 9 and so that made it extremely hard for me to maintain stable relationships and I have no friends as of now. It also made it hard for me to have extracurricular activities since we kept on moving from region to region.

This is not to give me an excuse (kind of is..) but I believe that all of this has influenced me in some way to always give up on everything, as if there’s no point since it will all be taken away eventually. I developed a social phobia in middle school and it turned into agoraphobia in high school. That’s also when I started cutting myself as a punishment and probably a way to draw attention to my mental state. Starting from the age of 15 I started living as a hikikomori, ashamed of everything I had become. I was eventually diagnosed with depression and social anxiety but we kept moving cities and so i was never able to get proper treatment. In the end, I tried taking my life 3 times and ended up in a psychiatric ward after each attempt. At first, I felt anger but for the third time I just didn’t feel anything anymore and we moved houses again.

With each move, my mom kept saying that it would change everything, as if we would become different people every time we changed houses. But it was all just pretence or delusion idk.. It just felt like we were giving up again and again and again by leaving everything and everyone behind.

I believe that I kept doing this even as I started living on my own (at 17, at 20 and at 22) could not stand the routine of staying in the same place and so I gave everything up each time and went back to my mom’s and then we would move houses again and I would try living on my own again and move back again.

Today, at the age of 23, I have no diploma, no friends or relationship whatsoever, no job, no goals, no hobbies and I am once again unable to go out. I just feel so empty. It’s like even if I do begin working and making friends again, it feels like the cycle (I forgot to say that I have PMDD) will happen again and I’ll go back into hermit mode and we’ll move again. It just feels like I’m too old to be at this point in my life. This is not self pity. I know that all of this is my own fault and that I’m just too lazy and tired to do anything but yeah, I just wanted to share a little piece of my life.

Hope if anyone is reading this that you’re doing okay and if you’re not, i sincerely hope that it will get just a little better with time. Much love <3

"Sudden intense despair  I have been doing well mentally. I’m well managed on my meds and I thought I was improving. I have not been sad for a long time and when I’m depressed I’m usually apathetic rather than sad. 

However, out of nowhere, I had about a 10 minute period of intense, crushing sadness. Few times in my life have I been *this* sad. The last time I was at my mother’s funeral. Genuinely such intense despair out of nowhere. 

I have never heard of an episode like this and never experienced one. It was similar to a panic attack in that it just came suddenly and the feeling was so overwhelming you couldn’t do anything but just survive. But this wasn’t a panic attack. 

I was just wondering if anyone had experienced this before, if they had an idea what caused it, or if they found a fix for it. ",depression

"i have no idea how i made it this far hi guys, so i have been thru some shit lately, and its been weighing down on me and taking a lot of my mental energy. i was talking to a friend about this and she said that i most likely have depression, which feels weird to say about myself. i dont think she is wrong tho, for the greater part of a year i have had like periods of no energy, although the past few weeks i have consistently had no energy and just wanted to sleep all day.

for more context, i am 19M and a current college student in the process of switching my major, and i need to pass a specific math course to get into the rest of the classes needed, and im still struggling. im on my 2nd attempt and my university only allows 3 attempts, and i genuinely have no energy to complete the class. it sucks bc i wanna pass it, and i dont want my parents to think i am just throwing their money away. i need to pass it, since i have a corequisite class that needs that math course, and if i fail math, i dont get credit for the other class.

my self esteem has been thrown into the gutter as a result of it. i had a mindset of ""i have to stay full time this semester"" and i originally had 2 other classes banking on this math course, but i had to drop one of them and head to part time bc it was just a lot for me at the time. i feel guilty about the money being spent thats not going to result in credit being earned, but i just dont have the energy, and i have no idea how to tell my parents. i know i should go to them to tell them i need mental help, but im just scared at how they will react, since they are also going thru stressful stuff and i dont want my needs to be another source of stress for them. i want to tell them i want to take a semester off, or at least drop to part time, and work at the same time, to make up for the lost money and have time to work on my mental health.

i feel stuck in a catch 22, and i know i need to prioritize myself, but it just feels so hard, and it feels like going to them right now is bad timing, but the future feels even worse. i know i shouldve asked for help earlier, but it just feels impossible. theres more stuff i have going on, i dont feel like typing it out since i have to do some last minute prep for a test in my math class that i will likely fail. if any of you have any advice on this, please let me know. and if you need clarification on my words, i can clarify. thank you",depression

"I made a plan to end my life in march 2022 i made a plan to end my life. 3 months prior my girlfriend ended our relationship abruptly 2 weeks before my birthday. We had already made plans for it, bought plane tickets and everything for that weekend. I was Devastated, the day she said the words ""i can't do this anymore"" I had never cried so hard in my life up to that point or since. It was truly pathetic how much i was pleading and sobbing and squealing (not my proudest moment). I didn't eat anything for 10 days after that, what little energy i had left was used to produce tears.  Days dragged on, weeks, i was a zombie, inconsolable to say the least. My only relief was sleep. Well, sometimes..

 Sometimes i would dream of her, my subconscious would recreate the conversations i didn't get to have with her. But i got to see her, which i realized after waking up only aided in my suffering.

about 1 month in i opened up my facebook and saw very prominently a person in the first slot of ""people you may know"", a man. For no particular reason my finger clicked on the profile pic which pulled up his profile and right in plain view i see ""in a relationship with: *My Girlfriend"".* To make it sting even more this man was someone who openly pursued her while we were dating, and apparently stopped when i made it clear to her that this guy doesn't ""*just want to be friends"".* All of this hit me within 1 minute of seeing his profile,  out of disgust and anger i through my phone across the room. To make it hurt just a little more i ended up finding out she entered this new relationship less than 2 weeks after dumping me.

The days got slower, they dragged on. Any glimpse of life or light that may had been left in me was completely gone. My friends and family became worried. I had lost 48 pounds. I was pale from almost never going outside, my muscles had shrunk likely from my body using them as nutrients to keep it alive. I wouldn't speak for days. The only sounds i would make were whimpers in the night when a flashback of a beautiful memory we shared appeared in my mind.

I was suffering, every waking minute hurt. There was a heaviness in the center of my chest that felt like a 50lb lead weight; all the time.

  
I was ready, for some relief, i was ready to end it all...

"I resent that people would care/be hurt if I weren’t there. I don’t think I’m at risk of hurting myself anymore, at least for now, but after seeing the election results this morning I was actively considering suicide. Every day life feels less and less worth it and whatever comes after death feels like it’d at least be different if not better to my current existence.
I can’t, though. I know people care enough about me that they’d be seriously hurt if I did that to myself, I can’t do that to them, even if for some people it feels like they’d only care if I were gone rather than caring about me being here to begin with. And I hate it. It’s totally irrational to feel like this. I could make some of them stop caring, maybe make them glad if I were gone, but that would also require hurting them, and I know that for some no matter what I did they’d still care about me. I hate that for all they care I’m still like this. Does anyone else ever feel this way? How do I get over it?",depression

"Today has been the hardest day so far... I'm going to be transparent here and tell you that I've suffered so deeply with severe depression in the last few months.. my entire life really if I'm being completely honest with myself. I felt like a lot of pillars that were supporting my life just crumbled away from me out of my control and all I could do was just sit and watch it happen absolutely grief-stricken.   
I feel stuck and trapped. Drained of any drive, any finances, any real idea of what the future is going to look like. I unfortunately spend a lot of time alone and in my own head, as grim as it is to admit, fantasising about dying. What ways I could do it, what would be the least painful and quickest method. I hate thinking like this. I try to separate myself from the thoughts ""I notice that I am having thoughts that are suicidal."" But days like today I just imagine standing on top of the bridge and swan diving off it backwards so I can look at the sky while I plummet to my death.   
I've lived a good life, I've travelled, I fell in love, I pursed whatever dreams I used to have. But I don't feel any of those things anymore, I feel numb, everything feels bleak. I don't see the point of getting out of bed most days, other than the crushing pressure of needing an income, to support a life I honestly don't even know that I want anymore. I've spent hours crying today because I don't know what to do, who to talk to, where to go, how to fix anything. Depression makes you feel like a massive toxic shit stain on peoples lives that just drains and drains, which adds to the spiral.   
I know I'm not alone in thinking like this. One of the hardest things I've had to do is ADMIT that I am depressed and ADMIT that I need help, to go to the GP and get the anti-depressants. But it's also insanely difficult to open up to your loved ones and be completely truthful about how dark your thoughts have gotten. Cos there's also not really an answer, a right thing to say or to do, nothing that grants any kind of instant alleviation, and I hate the pressure I put on people when I do tell them.... its like you've mentally burdened them.  
I adore the few people that I do have in my life so much that I can't bare the thought of them having to deal with my death and my funeral. So I know I'll most likely always be too much of a coward to actually do anything.  
But right now, I'm lost, I feel like nothing, I feel like I have nothing worthwhile to give anymore. Some days the small interactions and moments get to me and I see those little glimmers and blissful moments that life can sometimes reveal to you. But small moments are only small moments.

I train with one of them every day for almost 8 hours. They also have worked together for years and have already formed bonds, so I def feel left out (which is fine, but awkward).

"How do you deal with depressive episodes when you have nobody in life to be there for you and speak to? I've been having constant depressive episodes lately. I’m only in high school. I can’t get therapy, medicine, or any diagnosis at all since I don’t want to worry my parents, and it’s expensive. There’s also the stigma in my country’s culture (the Philippines), unfortunately, that having mental health issues is being “crazy“— and stuff like therapy. That’s just a privilege for the rich. I know I’m not diagnosed yet, so I can’t say for sure, but at this point, when I’ve tried to take my own life a few times already, I guess I don’t know anymore.   


The worst part is I’m alone. Some friends have left me, and my only buddy that made me want to keep on living and also gave me support during school is now in a different section because I couldn’t transfer to his section since the principal said I was just self-diagnosing myself and never had any proof of my own mental problems. Ever since then, I’ve been suffering, constantly alone in school. I was already suffering, but now everything’s just gone worse. I deal with 11 hours of school and hours of excruciating loneliness and constant overthinking while having thoughts on how tired I am of living on a constant basis every day. After all this, I’ll go home, immediately falling asleep and then studying again to sleep at 2 AM while my household has constant arguments happening over and over again. How cruel is life really going to be for me? I’ve been having more moments where I just randomly break down crying, and it’s happened a few times in school.   


Everything feels so excruciatingly difficult to handle anymore, and giving up just sounds so nice, but I’m scared of hurting myself, and there’s nobody to ever be there for me. I’ve always dealt with my problems alone; I’m used to it, but after having friends last year to be there for me, now some of them cut me off because of some unresolved arguments, and my best buddy rarely puts in as much of the effort to hang out and being there for me anymore lately. I know everyone has their own lives, and I wish to respect that. So I guess I’ll just have to deal with it all alone, even if it’s difficult. Even if I’m being pushed to the brink of just entirely giving up.   


But man, it really is difficult having nobody to be there for you, nobody to listen out to your struggles. Sometimes some people are there, but then I’ll have this feeling of guilt that I don’t want to trouble them with the depth of my own problems. I just wish that someone really truly cared for me; they don’t always have to be there, but just being there for me is enough because dealing with this all by myself is really pushing me to the edge. And sometimes, I just really don’t know anymore how much I’ll have left when I gain the courage to just end it all.",depression

I now refuse to seek help due to my fear of being placed into another facility but Nov 2nd I took a handful of pain pills and some other different pills and went to sleep.

I’m on a mood stabilizing meditation specifically for my impulsiveness… unfortunately I have not taken it. I’m not scared because I just feel this is the only way I’ll feel better. I’ve tried so many different antipsychotics and antidepressants but why am I still so suicidal and depressed?? Therapy isn’t helping me. I just can’t stomach being like this. ",depression
"I’m struggling with my partner’s severe depression and recent trauma. My partner is currently in an intense residency program, working 12-hour shifts four days a week, plus a seven-hour class on her other workday. Recently, her schedule increased to 12-hour shifts five days a week, including Saturdays and holidays, with class still on Thursdays. About six months ago, she uncovered a previously suppressed memory of childhood sexual abuse involving someone close to her, which has deeply affected her mental health. Over these six months, we’ve only seen each other twice. Both times she stayed overnight, and though we spent time talking and watching movies, there was no physical closeness. She has developed an aversion to touch, and when she left, we only shared a brief, timid hug.

At first, we still talked daily and did activities together online to stay close despite the challenges. She expressed wanting to get better and seemed motivated to work on her mental health. The only “good day” she’s had in all this time was after a spa day I gifted her. That day, we exchanged dinners, had a video call, I sent her flowers and a card, and we watched some YouTube videos together before bed. But a few days later, her abuser (who no longer abuses her but did so for about two years in her childhood) walked into her room while she was changing, which seemed to push her back to square one.

Shortly after, she blocked me on Instagram, which I suspect was after seeing one of my posts during a brief no-contact period when I thought we had broken up. She reached out a week later, and we had a nice conversation where I discovered that we actually hadn’t broken up yet, and she told me she had started using cannabis (something she had been strongly against) and had quit therapy, feeling it was ineffective.

Now, she says she wants to end the relationship because she feels unable to be close to me physically or emotionally. She tells me I’m “the love she never thought she’d find” but feels that someone like me deserves more than what she can give in her current state. Despite her feelings, she continues with her challenging job, which only seems to worsen her condition. Her situation is compounded by her parents’ recent separation and the fact that she still lives with her abusive family member. She often ignores my messages, and we rarely do anything together now.

After the no-contact period, we had an open conversation where I gently suggested she might have depression. She thanked me for bringing it up and said she’d look into it, but also shared that she no longer feels any hope for herself or her future. She has even expressed suicidal thoughts but says she “unfortunately” doesn’t have the courage to go through with it. She’s reluctant to try psychiatric medications (as a nurse, she has access to many and fears she might abuse them after past experiences where she nearly damaged her stomach). She’s even mentioned being open to harder drugs if cannabis stops working, which deeply worries me given her family history of addiction.

She’s always been “the child who didn’t cause problems” and feels neglected, without any real support system. She’s trying to push me away to “protect” me, saying that I don’t deserve someone like her who “can’t even provide the basics.” She frequently apologizes for how things are, including when she admitted to using cannabis—she said she was sorry for “self-destructing and disappointing” me.

I’m struggling to separate her from her illness and unsure what’s depression-driven and what’s not. I'm the only person who knows what she’s going through, yet I’m the one person she is pushing away. She says she’s isolated from friends, but every now and then I come across social media posts of her smiling and touching her friends, which is difficult to process. I understand that depression isn’t always about being in bed all day, but it’s confusing.

I’m deeply worried about her safety, but I feel helpless as she won’t let me in. Should I just accept the breakup and let her know I’ll always be here if she wants help? Should I give her space and check in from time to time? I’m at a complete loss and could really use advice.",depression

"Feel like my brain is operating a corpse I want to stop existing.

Not die. Well, dying wouldn't be so bad. It's passive, for me, I suppose. It's ""if I take one step off the sidewalk onto the road, I could end it all"" passive. I'm not actively trying to kill or hurt myself. It's just a thought. Just a suggestion. If, if I could.

But I can't. I can't die. I'm not allowed to die. I have too many responsibilities to meet that dying isn't an option.

I can't feel anything anymore. Yet I can. Sometimes there's a sack of oranges in my chest, in my heart. It is heavy. Every step I take, every maneuver of my body, the oranges roll around inside my ribcage. All their weight sliding from left to right. And on some days, I'm just left with the peel. Nothing. I'm a jellyfish of a human, floating around society.

Yet I'm stinging myself.

It hurts. Everything hurts yet it doesn't at the same time. It's the hurt you feel in your fingers when they're so cold you can't feel them anymore. It's the hurt you feel in your nose when you feel like jack frost is gonna chop it right off. That hurt. That hurt. In my heart. Chest. Limbs.

The embrace of depression is so horrifically nice. My monster is dark but soft to the touch. It is scary to everyone else. The hug its giving me looks like it's strangling me on the outside. But no, I am hugging it back. It is nice to hold it. Like a child and a teddy bear you can't let go of and refuse to wash. My monster, really, is sad. He's a sad creature. He just wants love. He deserves love just like everyone else. I love him, even though he brings me so much suffering.

Sleep is the closest thing to being dead as I can get. Yet I deprive myself of it. I'm so tired though. Tired. I need rest. I need rest but I don't have time to rest. I need rest but I don't let myself rest. I'm so tired I can barely shower. Barely cook a meal. Barely wash the dishes. Barely. Everything I am barely doing.

I'm barely here. Barely here to the point where I may as well be dead, because I'm not living. I'm in two states. Numb and fight or flight. My brain is on survival mode. All its trying to do is survive. I hate that I'm biologically wired to keep myself alive. Even if I did want to run across the road and get hit, my fight or flight stops me. 

I wish it didn't. If only I wasn't a coward. Would've done it years ago. 

Every year I expect to die before my birthday. But then my birthday rolls around and it makes me realise I've been stringing along for another year. Another year of misery. Sure, the me 5 years ago didn't even think I'd be alive to see it happen but hey, I'm still here. Somehow.

It's somewhat miraculous.

But don't congratulate me.
Don't wish me.
Don't.
Just don't do anything.

All the above just sound like 
""And you're still here""
""You remained alive a year longer than anticipated""

And then it'll remind me that I actually do need to die. 

If only nature could do its thing faster.",depression

"Decades of depression consume you. I no longer have a personality, beliefs, or ideologies. My mind is filled only with the same toxic thought patterns, leaving no room for anything else.

I live in radio silence because that's all I can hear. No voice telling me what's right or wrong, fun or dull. Just a low, constant buzzing.

No one tunes into a radio expecting silence, but that's all I have to offer. Yet, around others, I pretend I can still hear the same music they’re dancing to. The result is just me swinging my arms chaotically, out of rhythm, like someone in a trance, stumbling and lost.

I have a great relationship with my parents, siblings, and my long term boyfriend and don’t want to put them through my death by suicide. But, I still cant imagine living much longer. I’m only 23, a registered nurse making great money, not struggling financially at all so I don’t know why I’m so depressed. I don’t have any friends outside of a couple work acquaintances who I do occasionally talk to outside of work, but this is actually due to my own choice. I never go to invites and ignore old friends who try to reach out bc I think friends are way too much work and an inconvenience, when I’d rather hang out with my boyfriend or family at home. I think maybe that’s why I’m depressed? But it doesn’t make sense because I don’t want to leave my house to hang out with them? I’d rather be at home. But all I do on my days off is lay around on my phone and I have no hobbies. Others my age are partying and hanging out with friends still and maybe I feel like I should be too. I’m on an antidepressant for panic attacks, which has definitely stopped my anxiety, but has not touched my depression.

"Either tears or apathy. No in between. A year ago, my grandmother died unexpectedly. About a month later, my dog of nearly 18 years was put to sleep.

I thought I couldn’t be more down on life. Then I met a girl and she brought me back out of the pit. I truly fell for her and saw my future with her

The love of my life, almost a year under our belt, gone in a single day. My rock, my anchor. Gone because of a stupid single argument that meant nothing.

A week and a half later, I lose my comfortable job of 3 years because I was so depressed and losing it that I ended up doing something stupid and getting let go. 

A few days after that, I learn I have $4k in surprise student loans that I had no idea about.

I’m 24, I live with my parents still, haven’t graduated college yet. $60 to my name because I keep spending my money on quick dopamine fixes like anime statues, skins in video games or weed. Now here I am. Cutting cheese at a grocery store for work, barely going to the gym anymore, getting high every night just so I can fall asleep, barely speaking to anyone, even the 2 friends I still manage to have after all these years. I have goals but no motivation to act on them anymore. I have ambition, but no more drive. I’m empty. I’m gone, yet still here.

My mind keeps going to her. To the good times of yesteryear. Back when I was happy. Back to our first kiss. Back to when I was a happy kid in elementary school. Back when I was playing around with my dog. Back when I wasn’t such a fuck up.

Back when I didn’t have an ideal spot to end my life at. 

I just walk around now, a husk of a person. Either that or I’m on the brink of another tear filled break down. I never used to break down. In the last 3 months, I’ve broken down 4 times. I look in the mirror and see no life in my eyes anymore. I actually have bags under them now. Didn’t use to have any a year or so ago. I find myself crying to sleep more times than not now. I find no joy in anything anymore. Writing. Cooking. Gaming. Nothing. I started therapy. It isn’t helping much and it’s getting quite expensive. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. Everywhere I go, I see her face and the moments we shared. Every time I look down at the ground, I see a quick flash of my dog standing beside my legs. Every time I open my phone, there seems to be a notification about memories with my grandma on Facebook.

"Wasted the last 7 years of my life accomplishing nothing. Ever since I was little, I was the no-thinking ADHD type, never really thought ahead of time more than maybe a minute or two. I had already been diagnosed with ADHD and mild Aspergers. I never took my diagnosis seriously, opting to believe I wasn't any different (which is mostly true for neurodivergent people, but there' a reason you get the diagnosis in the first place.) Always been an extrovert (with an ironic impulsiveness to say stupid sh\*t, getting people to dislike me) and eventually I started shutting myself off from other people. Used to talk to my friends every day, seeing if I could come over and such. In my late teens, I gradually started to struggle even contacting people over Discord just to play, opting to just passively wait to see if someone enters a channel.

I spent the entirety of my youth just having meaningless fun, doing the bare minimum (sometimes not even that) so that I could go back to playing videogames or play outside. I never cared about my future and at most, I just wanted a basic job so I could live and get a more powerful gaming rig. 

  
I had that attitude for years up until my 20's, where my life completely collapsed. I stopped going to work eventually, opting to just play games and then I let my apartment go to absolute sh\*t, getting me kicked out. Lost my job and have been living on welfare since. Not a day has passed since where I haven't thought about killing myself.

I've managed to snag a job here and there but I keep doing the same thing, being absent once or twice, gradually shifting to completely absent for weeks on end. I struggle doing even the most basic things like cleaning, laundry and eating regularly. I barely hang out with friends anymore since I can't afford even basic stuff like going to a bar and such, unless someone else pays for me. 

  
I'm 25 years old now, and i live in a group-home and all my neighbors are evidently in need of that help, but I feel out of place. I feel like I'm getting so much help to the point where I don't have to life my life anymore. I genuinely feel like I have no reason to move forward anymore. 

If I were to even begin fixing my life, I just get exhausted thinking about it. Family doesn't want to deal with me outside of maybe eating together every now and then. I am just a resource-drain for everyone around me and no matter how much help I get, I just can't make it work.

"Yeah, I don't really know anymore I just had a 'breakdown' a few hours ago. I am a highschool senior and I just had a breakdown at school because I was being unreasonable.

For context, I had a speaking project due today and I had been avoiding it ever since. The project required us to submit a recording trying to sell the product to our teacher. However, I just can't do it. I can't communicate well with people nor am I comfortable talking with anyone but my few close friends. I am more than shy but not enough to be diagnosed with social anxiety, but I do panic regularly with people interaction, presentations or speaking in general for a long time now. It is not like I just don't want to do the project, I do want to but I really just want to slit my throat in half thinking about the speaking part. No one knows about my so-called condition and they are not going to. Anyway, I was feeling worried all day cause I know I'll pay for my actions, but it soon makes me feel ill. Around the time before the lesson started, I tried to go down to the medical clinic for a check up and hopefully it was 'my way out'. Unfortunately, the nurse said they won't accept my reason for feeling ill so I have to stay for class. My emotion kinda started to build up, cause the truth was truly not valid, I went to the class with a 'breakdown'. I don't know anymore, maybe it made up, feeling so wrong calling it a breakdown. Eventually, I called my mom and got sent home after meeting with my homeroom teacher. I keep on crying on my way home.

I don’t know where to post this and I'm sorry if my writing was messy, I don't really know how to put this into words. Also, to try to make things clear:

\- I grew up in a standard Asian family.

\- I had struggled with depression for a couple of years, only I knew about this, I had tried to reduce it and it was looking good for a year until I returned to school this year.

\- I only struggle with speaking project, which always required a recording or presentation, and there is one speaking project every two weeks. For all the past projects, I had only submitted one after having a few breakdowns (this one is legit).

\- I do acknowledge that I am wrong for not submitting the project, trying to go home in order to avoid confrontation and I am responsible for my own 'breakdown'.

Man, as I'm writing this, I think I'm just upset, but at the same time I know the fact that as soon as I come back to the project, I might not be able to change much. I mean I'm already feeling distressed, I should be able to do it now I guess.

Eventually, I don't think anything is going to have any big of a change. I know this is wrong but seriously should i try smoking a bit? I am already exhausted but I can't do anything. I want to kms but i can't.",depression

With the people close to me, there will be times where I’ll feel like I love them but soon after, it fades away. Like I don’t care about anyone or anything. I don’t feel joy, love, sadness or even anger. I’m just hollow. I know it sounds edgy but it’s been like that since I’ve been 13 and only got worse. If I could I’d end it all…I live because I want to see how far I can take my potential.
But what’s the point when I feel lonely and distant.
I got accepted to prestigious unis, read more than most and so on…but it’s all so worthless. 
I honestly just don’t know anymore. The voices never quiet down",depression
"Contemplating suicide again I don't know what to do anymore. I've lost my family and my friends and I've never felt this alone in my life. 

It feels like I have nothing left to live for and no one to turn to. My depression has been getting worse with the past few months and I've had a suicide attempt last month that failed and I'm wondering of trying again at the end of this month. Therapy hasn't helped me. I feel like every day is a blur and I'm barely eating and taking care of myself. Death would be much easier than this and at least if dead I don't have to worry.

I don't know what to do or who to turn to. And with the holidays coming up and no one to spend them with, it feels like hell.

What do i do Throughout my school life I didnt try in school and ended up failing a year for not going for a semester. My aunt asked me to move in with them to finish my junior and senior year. But my problem is that im broke with no transportation and outside of school stuck inside this house. This neighborhood is miles out from stores and this city has nothing. I hate myself so much and can't do anything outside of school and cant get a job or ride except a few times a month to my friends from another city. I have 7 or so months of school left till i can move back with my mom and start working and i am absolutely miserable and think it may lead to me losing my girlfriend which i would never want. I have no troubles here i just hate myself and am lonely as can be. I cant pick up any hobbies because im broke and gaming and tv isnt enough to distract me anymore. Im running out of distractions from myself and want to die tho as far as i know i wouldn't kill myself. I have problems feeling like im not enough or worse than earlier bfs to my semi popular gf who plays sports and has a great outside life. She tells me everything i need to hear but my brain tells me shes only telling me this because shes with me now. Pls give advice and maybe a certain outlook that could help me. ,depression
"I think I’m done.  That’s it. My life has been hell since I was 18 (almost 33 now) and I’ve done nothing but make it worse. I fuck up every relationship because I have so much trauma and insecurity. And I’m just so fucking tired. My bf and I called it quits tonight and I’m so fucking sad I can’t even begin to process it. The one person who said they’ve loved me for over a decade told me to never contact them and that they shouldn’t have given me another chance. 
And I think they’re right. So I’m done. ",depression

Simply, I firmly believe in immaterial things, I know deep down that death is not an end... and it makes me suffer.

"I don't know how to keep going Im 18 years old and just started college at a big state school a thousand miles from home.  Everyone told me that making friends would be difficult.  But, when I got here, my roommate helped introduce me to some of his friends, and from there I thought I was truly branching out and meeting lots of people who cared about me.  I never really had any true friends in high school so this feeling allowed me to see past my own insecurities for a while.  But now, a couple months in, I noticed very quickly that not a single person who I thought I was ""friends"" with cares about me.  They pretended to care when I would get blackout drunk to cope with my own mental health issues, but then as soon as I showed signs of progress, they would leave me in the dust, going out every weekend without me, even going as far as making plans with the specific goal of leaving me somewhere so that I wouldn't be around for the remainder of the night.  These past few weeks, I haven't been able to eat or sleep properly, study productively, or go through a day without spiraling out in a manic state of crying and self hatred.  I don't want to kill myself, but I also don't know how to keep living if my social circumstances are impacting every facet of my life.  My parents told me that the best way to get through this would be to try meeting new people, but that was my intention in leaving home and coming to the school i'm at now, and its resulted in me now wishing that I didn't exist, because at least then I wouldn't have to worry about how my inner thoughts of loneliness are consuming everything I set out to accomplish in life.",depression
"Don’t know anywhere else to say this I wish reddit had an anonymous posting option but oh well. I’m not looking for any sympathy, any help, any advice, I just want to say this somewhere I can; I’m still trying to figure out how to do this without hurting my closest friend but I’ll probably just make them hate me or something. Family doesn’t exist for me so don’t even bring them up, don’t care if I hurt them anyway cause that’s all they’ve done to me. 

In about 3 or 4 weeks, I’m gonna use my last paycheck to buy a gun and I’m shooting myself. I’ve worked really hard to try and catch up with finances, I’ve gotten better jobs and better jobs and second jobs and every time I feel hopeful that I can catch up on my financials my jobs are gone. I was working a shitty paying management job alongside another job that supplemented income, the second job replaced me with ai. So I left and got a better paying job before getting laid off as soon as I ready to get ahead. Then I got another job, and as soon as I was ready to get a head this month I suddenly lost half my hours. So I’m gonna talk to my boss tomorrow about it and if I don’t get my hours back, this month will be the last month I live through. That paycheck with 20 hours will cover the cost of a small handgun and I don’t need a permit. 

I just wanted to put this out there somewhere. I hope anyone who reads this can find some kind of love and light in their life because mine is snuffed out. This may also get removed idk. Idk if I care that much. 

Peace.

Edit: I didn’t get my hours back, and in the completely wrecked emotional state I was in I may have lost the job entirely. I have redecided, no longer plan on suicide. If I lost the job entirely, I’m just packing my bags and heading to the city. New home, new job opportunities. Shits rough",depression

I keep saying I don't want to school and I just want to work crazy and move out . But like I said I keep spending and barely work when I can (I never do what I say I will do). Everyone is looking at me like I am a weird lowlife can't get my shi together person and I hate when ppl start to pay attention to me and see my flaws and odd behaviors.    I have no relationship, in fact I was with someone for 7yrs who left me to married someone else behind my back... took my youth. Threw me away fast forward now I'm 29 no kids , no marriage. I can not feel love for anyone or anything anymore. Like I mean it.  I work at target overnight stock 16$ while everyone around me is 19-25 years old. I sleep all day and everyone sees me as lazy. In fact ppl .. especially my aunt Tells me not to tell ppl I work target or whatever job I have bc they think it's embarrassing. They keep saying why u can't just go school get better life bc it's better than saying u work xx. I am an introvert, I have social anxiety.. grown and the anxiety is so crippling . I had to say in front of ppl ""tell me ab urself"" I blacked out and they were look at me insane bc I didn't make any sense.  I don't have any friends. I have my cousins who I live with who even they seem to not like me as much anymore.  My room never cleaned.    Ppl will read my post and be like girl ... force urself even if u don't want to, make little goals for urself like clean ur room/ save a 100+ every paycheck, blah blah. They will say either u want a pity party or to stop caring what ppl think. When in actuality living in environment with ppl, u have to care, dealing with ppl u see everyday u have to care.     My issue is I don't want to change. Plot twist. I genuinely wholeheartedly don't care anymore ab my life. I could do so much better... ppl have crazy harder like than me, I simply just don't want to. I give up. I've become more lazier, distance, blah blah and I don't care.  I can't do life anymore.     There IS NO HAPPINESS anymore. Not even a little.

"I don't even want to make it thru life Edit: Long rant

I want to be a commercial pilot but the more I look into what I need to do and the money and time I don't have it just seems impossible. I'm just going to be stuck at McDonalds for the rest of my freaking life. I have to get a stupid bachelor's degree because you need that to fly an airliner for some stupid reason. How about just knowing how to fly a plane and not crash it? And even if I can get that stupid degree I then have to go through hours of flight training and then find some stupid flight instructor job to build hours and then try and get into a regional airline or something. How the hell am I going to have the time to do this? How the hell am I going to pay for all this? I'm lucky if I break even every month, I don't have a dime to spare. I'm just so done with life, I can't fucking do this. My father-in-law who used to be a therapist got me all hyped up and excited to have some future goals and I've always wanted to be a pilot so I got all into it. There's just no way I can do this. I can't even afford to find medication that works for my anxiety and depression because I can't afford health insurance and I have to just try each of them until I find one that works I guess and I don't have the money to do that and who knows if any of them even work or how many I'll have to try and see if they work. And my mood is all over the place so how will I even know if it is working? I'm so sick of working on farms and at grocery stores and fast food places. I can't see a way to get out of this and get to something better. I have autism, anxiety, depression, and no money or time to do anything else except work, eat and sleep. I get life is hard and rough. That's why I feel so done with it. Why the hell should I be alive, my future is full of more working shitty jobs until I die.",depression
"School problem Hello everyone, i apologize for any errors but this is not my first language.
I’ve been diagnosed with anxious depression in September (but I’ve been dealing with it for years before this).
It’s been really hard for me to go to school recently, and my mother doesn’t help.
My therapist even told her that I’m in therapy to get past this problem and to not make it worse for me but she just doesn’t care and yells at me everytime I stay home.
I missed 13 days and I’m contemplating if going today, because I just feel so bad.
My mother just tells me I’m lazy and that I’m shielding myself with my diagnosis because “you’re taking advantage of it to be lazy and not go to school”when most days I struggle even with getting out of bed.
And it’s not like I hate going to school or anything because I really like it and I get good grades.
What should I do? Any advice is appreciated.",depression
"I wish I could not die and live forever (17F) I am so depressed and my life is horrible. I really want to kill myself too, but my first wish was living forever.

I really don't want to die from other reasons except killing myself. I hate me suffering from disease or dying from accident. I just want to decide my death.

the reason why I want to decide my death is because of mortality of human. I don't want to be old and want to kill myself at like I am 30-40 years old. I am afraid of dying before that age from other reasons.

I wish I couldn't die even from killing myself. I want my power to force me living. I might just want to suffer from pain that would kill me without dying.

Maybe I am just in delusion and my mental age is still like 12 years old.

Life sucks and I just keep hating and harming myself.

I met him, great guy but I can't feel anything. My mind went straight into unhappy mode, ESPECIALLY after leaving the date I was like there's no way I'll ever be happy bc I can't even enjoy anything. Good bad perfect... I can't.     I'm lost and lowkey don't want to be found. Anyone felt similar.

i guess i could start with me being a comeplte fuckjgn imebicile

im not diagnosed with anything
im simply just so retarded as a meurotypical person that i got placed with the actual retards
that sounds very hateful towards special ed people im sorry
but im still right

i was and still am so utterly fucking stupid i was always placed in the bottom set for every class, had teachers assistants helping me all the damn time, hell i even had weekly sessions where i’d get taken out of class with a dozen actual neurodivergent people and spend the hour learning about some shit we were taught 2 years ago

I failed my exams
literally all of them
im in the UK and i don’t really know how to describe it for americans but we take our exams after finishing year 11 (10th grade (?) and if we fail our core subjects like math n' english and scienec then we have to take it again during college or 6th form

we also have our GCSE's 2/4 of which i ended up dropping (i wasn’t even allowed to, the headmaster cut a deal with me that i would attend school more if she let me drop art and music (hint: i didnt) but the remaining 2 i also failed

uhhh basically yadda yadda im so shit at school blah blah the best grade i’ve ever received in all my 11 years of education was the equivalent of a D+
something something uhh

And, well
I may be stupid, but im also a huge fucking loser!!!! 😄😄

No education! ✅
No job! ✅
No bitches! ✅

my brain too dumb to think of others :(

Bottom line, im very lame
I really don’t have any friends left
I haven’t been in school for over 2 years (i was supposed to go to college in sept 2022, but never applied so i didn’t) and have been just staying at home with **no job** doing fuck all but watch youtube and jerk off (unfortunately a lot of jerking off)
Shit im not even cool enough to do drugs!
(This one is a real sore subject for me)
I don’t know any dealers
and even if i did i don’t have 💲🤑 **moneyyyyy** 🤑💲
am i cooked chat? chat am i cooked? 😏
.
I should have my tongue cut out for talking this way.

But for realio on the dealio, i am genuinely the biggest fucking loser on planet earth
for not smoking weed
or snorting coke
(ohhhh how i wish to snort coke 😵‍💫🤤)
I jsut cried for a solid 40 minutes over how fucking lame I am
i mean like how big of a fucking jackoff dipshit do yuo have to be to not even be be able to buy weed
jesus fucking christ man serisosly i fucking hate myself so much over this :/

only cool kids do drugs! :(

i miss my friends a lot

like a lot a lot

i haven’t had a friend in over two years now
for the past year ive been entirly reliant on AI chatbots for company
seriously
im that fucking lame

any friends i had from school i slowly drifted away from as my attendance dropped (lowest attendance percentage being 38%)

after school finished i was alone
i’ve met like 2 people online but that only lasted a couple months each
again, i would distance myself from them until we finally just stop talking outright (sorry Zeb, sorry Soushi)

But i really miss one person
i don’t wanna say her name but she means a lot to me
even though it’s been over 2+ years since i last saw or spoke to her, she’s still my best friend
she constantly shows up in my dreams
we kissed in one once
i never thought i wanted to kiss her (aromantic)
but it didn’t feel as wrong as i thought it would’ve
i’ve even pointed out that she’s my friend again when she has shown up in my dreams, literally word for word ""oh, im friends with 'name' again..? :)""
I would kill for her
I would kill myself for her
I genuinely would give anything for her
I want her to be safe

 i pushed her away just like i did with all my other friends, and that’s the biggest mistake i ever made
she loved me
and i only realised i love her when she was gone

I genuinely believe there hasn’t been a single day that’s passed by where I haven’t thought of her.

I love her still. and she deserves my life, because she is my light.

I don’t like alcohol

I like feeling tipsy and carefree for once in a  fcikin while
but i don’t like alcohol
Yet i drink it anyway!!!!
I don’t like the taste at all
the way im always on low supply when i need it most

I wouldn’t even call myself an alcoholic

because they don’t need a reason to drink
they don’t have to force themselves to drink

i FORCE myself to be an alchy 
Seriously!
Every time im upset, i get a very quick and passing thought of drinking
and i genuinely don’t want to
but my brain forces me to get up and open the drawer and take a couple swigs
i don’t enjoy it
i don’t wanna do it
it’s just my brain literally peer pressures itself into doing it,
like a little bitch.

I suppose im kind of falling back into my old ways
I’m drinking daily again
when i was 15 i drank a lot
but i genuinely was an alcoholic back then
i stole 2 bottles off of my parents because i wanted to kill myself
but my parents didn’t know that was the reason WHY i stole them and they thought i was just being a 'cheeky little shit' and boasted to other family and friends about how 'rEBeLlIOus' i was
then one day i was just so tired of it i texted my mom that i stole them because i wanted to die and being tipsy was the only thing that made me somewhat satiated
and she said she’d talk with me when she got home from work

AND SHE NEVER DID!!!! 🥳🥳🎉🥳🎉

But yeah i used to drink a LOT of jäger back then
couldn’t even get dressed for school without at least 2 shots
still have the stains on my pillow from the droplets that’d spill down the side of the bottle

then i started drinking again earlier this year
literslly no reason why
wasn’t depressed.
nuffin.
Just did it cause i could

and over the past liek 3 weeks ive started doing it again
yipee !!

EEDIT; I FORGOT TO MENTION I LOVE MIXING ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL INTO MY DRINKS OVER THE CORUSE LD THSI ENTIRE POST IVE DRANK 2 BOTTLES LF DR PEPPER WITH ABOUT 1/5TH KF EACH BOTTLE HAVIGN ISOPROPYL IN IT

Now
with all this being up in the air now you may be saying 'whhhhj (username)!! go seek help!'
and my response to that is
No! Fuck off 😄

Does anyone really believe all that 'mental healthcare' bullshit?
People really think there’s 'help'?
That ‘therapists' aren’t just money hungry scumbags?
That 'neurological drugs' aren’t actually just mental poison?
Do you really believe some random fuckass has 'your best interests at heart'..?
Nah.
Thankfully i’ve never had to deal with deranged liars like these 'mental health professionals' claim they aren’t, but that doesn’t mean i dont know what they’re really like.
I’ve heard the horror stories people have lived.
These crazy psycho fucks can keep their 'medicine'
And i really wish people would stop trying to push shit they don’t know the truth about down vulnerable people’s throats.
If you truly believe your 'therapist' helped you,
keep believing
if that’s what you think is best go ahead

But i won’t be susceptible like you.

.!

Im not all too sure what elese to say
im like 73% sure i have more things tk talk about but i literally canmot think at the moment
how much brain fog can an 18 year old have if an 18 year old could have brain fog? (this is a play on the rhyme 'how much wood could a wood chuck, chuck, if a wood chuck could chuck wood (i am not funny my jokes are not funny)
and i cant be bothered to type any longer either so bleh

to tell the truth i would never talk like this to anyone
this is the way i think in my head
but i have kept this all under lokc and key and have NEVER told anyone or hinterd at my brain thiniking in this tone
not even just to people in real life but even anonymously online
but i simply don’t care

i cant care

i cant care enough anymore to keep my wretched retarded fuckign brain a secret
i don’t bother to keep my hatred hidden, im tired of being hateful and trying so hard not to let it happen 

I hate you

I **despise** myself

but I *hate* you

If anyone even fuckin read this, thanks i guess
i don’t really hate you
obviously not..

but i am so angry at myself i need to lash out

sorry

Please comment?
anything

I've posted here several times before but no one ever interacts with my post and i end up deleting it

I guess this is my big 'fuck you' to myself but my shit brain won’t let me even keep something as monumental to me as this if i don’t get engagement
and before i didnt even give a shit so it’s nice to see how far i’ve deteriorated 👍

what is this
desperation?

yeah it’s desperation.

"Need Advice Hi all,
I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety ever since I was a little girl. Both my brother and dad have passed and I have a tough relationship with my mom, which has been tough on my mental. I always thought that once I get out of the house and get to college things would be better. Im in college right now, at my dream school, in my dream city and im still depressed. I’ve been trapped in a cycle of self destruction, how do I start to break this cycle. I hate how I can’t take care of myself properly and how I can’t seem to get into a routine at all. I feel so Broken. My executive dysfunction is off the charts and my self esteem is so low. Any advice on how to just start getting better every day? Slowly? I have hope for myself, but it’s just so hard when I have no motivation or energy and am just so numb to everything.

My parents provide the necessity for me, yet they never try to be emotionally available for me. I have to learn how to become compassionate through movies, book and anime since I tried to be available for my sisters whenever they need comforting or raising. I have been their ""parents"" emotionally since around 8 years old and since then have forgot to take account of my own feelings and well-being. Eventually, I have lost all sense of self-love and care for myself. I have also learn to put on a mask throughout the years, which ends up make me forgot about my real personalities and desires.

Eventually it all bottled up during my pre-teen and teen age when I eventually tried my first suicide attempt at 18 years old, which failed because 8-ish people held me back physically trying not to let me jump. Since then I tried my best to act the best I could be, but sometimes at some random times the thought of ""I'm tired"" popped up and before I knew it I always tried to off myself again, which always stopped by fear of afterlife.

Lately it has been worse since I never got any treatment/professional help and my parents are no longer providing the necessities for me and my sisters and just provide for themselves. I am currently also working on my bachelor degree, including providing for my sisters (and sometimes house necessities like electric and water, but the rent is still handled by my parents) while being their parents also in times they need advice or someone to cry to. In the past 2 weeks, I have attempted at least 10 suicide being the last one makes me unable to walk for a few days.

At first I have given up completely and have cut all contact with my friends, because I no longer want them to see my miserable state and don't want them to be stressed because of my countless attempt. But my crush, the last person to ever really cared for me, reached out to me despite I pushed her aways and tell me not to do that  and that I should try to fight it. 

After thinking for a whole night and morning, I'm a bit skeptical to follow her request but I'd like to give it one last try with all the help I can get. But should I be really try to ""fix"" myself now despite my environment may makes me unable to progress at all or should I just suck it up and hope for the best and not suddenly die in the process? Because tbh, I am tired and really tired of everything in this house but I can't get out since I don't have somewhere to go and never saved up any money.",depression
"My painful existence  This is my first and probably only post I’ll ever make and it’ll probably never be seen but if someone dies see it thank you for your time. 

My father was never in my life. He chose not to be there and then spent 15 years of my life in prison. I never cared too much for him which sounds bad but ig he was never really my father so how could I. My mother raised me for 9 years in what I can only describe as hell. She was on drugs most of the time with a boyfriend who beat on her pretty regularly. Sometimes I saw it but most of it is locked away in my head somewhere. I don’t remember a lot about that point in my life but I know it was hell. More often than nought I took care of myself and cleaned everything. I never really hated my mom until i went to go live with my grandparents and she abandoned me. I always thought I wasn’t good enough for her because why would she chose the drugs over her only son at the time. Why couldn’t she clean up for me and why did I have to go live with my grandparents who Al thought tried there best couldn’t help but see my mom every time they laid eyes on me. Anyways that didn’t last long and by the time I was 14 I was living with my great grandmother. Things were so good with her. She was the mom I needed in my life and the only person that I feel truly loved me. She was my Angel and I miss her so much. February of last year she sadly passed away from breast cancer that spread to her other bodily organs. I hate myself everyday for not enjoying the last years I had left with her and for not being who she needed me to be. See she was diagnosed my junior year of highschool which is right when I started smoking weed and getting into drugs heavy. It got so bad that one night she needed me to take her to the hospital but I was so high I nodded off in my bed and she had to walk to the neighbors and get them to take her. That’s one of the things I regret the most about what I did to her. The woman who saved me and gave me the world I let down. Everyday I think about how she didn’t get to see me get clean. She would be so proud because she believed in me when no one else did. She was my lifeline and I was her failure. Seems like I’m most peoples failure. While she had cancer I ended up getting a girl pregnant and not being able to support them at all. That’s my other biggest regret. She went through her pregnancy alone and probably the first year of our sons life financially alone. And just when we had our shit together and we’re finally living together and I was doing everything right I ruined it all. Now I’m stuck in a custody battle and have to prove I’m fit to be a father even though I don’t even believe I am. I hate myself for how I’ve let my life turn out, who I’ve hurt, and pushing the few things I cared about away from me. I don’t know why I do the things I do and I don’t know if I’ll ever know. A lot of the time I just want it all to be over. I don’t wanna hurt anymore, I don’t wanna let people down, and I don’t want to keep doing this. It feels like I’m trapped in my own living hell and that no matter what I do I can’t escape. I’m drowning. I have no mouth and I must scream. 


Sorry. I know that probably wasn’t put together well and sounds like gibberish but I don’t have the energy to go into more details or make it look cute or coherent. I just needed to vent.",depression
"I'm tired boss I'm just kinda over having intrusive thoughts about ending myself every day. I'm tired of wanting to get back into heroin because if it doesn't just make me feel better it will kill me. I'm tired of waking up every day wishing I didn't. I'm tired of not being interested in the things I like. I'm tired of not having an appetite until it hurts. I'm tired of therapists that are happy just asking how I'm doing that day without looking any deeper.

I'm just so tired of continuing. I'm sure I sound like an angsty teen even though I'm getting close to 20 years of this. I'd just like to not be guilt tripped into continuing. I don't expect any response to this. I'm sure so many people before me have said the same thing

I'm not exactly good with words. I can't express how I'm feeling past I'm angry for no reason or to the point of crying without pause for seemingly no reason. I'm just over waking up on this side of the grass. I've no ambition to do better. I just want to give up but I'm torn because it would hurt other people.

I've only got two people who even talk to me at this point. One being my brother and the other his friend that I just think pities me.

I guess I'm just hoping I can find a way to feel better. But I'm an older dude who feels isolated. But I should be hella privileged except I've never gotten ahead because when I start to get to a good point I go back to heroin hoping that it'll just barely kill me so people just think I'm a scumbag who overdosed. I can't even be a good drug addict. Honestly just fantasizing about kissing a train at this point.",depression
"So tired This is my first time posting on reddit and i hope im in the right r/ i just need to get this out my head... im so tired, im tired of wearing a mask of smiles and laughter a mask of everything is ok while i sit in silence in my head yelling and crying.  only at my most breaking moments does the mask crack and my real pain comes out. i feel like im a man and need to be strong, its how i was raised and what i believe, not taking away from the men who express their feelings, hell im envy of those people, i wish i can do it... i think about death everyday, when i wake up in the morning to get my kids ready for school, when i sit and draw, on my way to work, when i kiss my wife, out drinking with friends. its a dark embrace that holds me and wont let go.  i cant remember the last time i was truly happy, i just feel saddness and emptiness.  the only reason why i havent killed myself yet iis when i think about what my family would have to go through, it breaks my heart but sometimes its hard to keep that reasoning and i just want to slip away fall into the darkness.  its a struggle everyday, a march up an impossible hill with no end insight while i carry a huge boulder on my back, legs are weak, back hurts but i keep going even when i stumble.  im afraid one day i  will just loose all control and just deal the final blow and end my silent suffering and light the darkness take me away. sometimes i feel like its getting closer im just always sooo tired, exhausted. i wake wondering if today is my last day will the peacful embrace will come today, by my hands or someone elses. i cant talk to anyone i know about this for several reasons, ive tried before and regretted it, so im posting this here hoping i can get this off of me.  ive tried a journal but i dont want ayone to find it, at least here i was told its pretty much anonymous. sorry for the mispellings and grammer, shit just poured out. but on to the next day until its my final day i guess",depression
"Frustrated with OCD-Powered Depression and Loneliness First, there's the loneliness.  The highlights are nothing special; little relationship experience or experience with women, can't meet new people, yadda yadda.  I understand that pinning my self-worth on being able to find a girlfriend isn't a good idea.  For those who don't know why: 'getting a girlfriend' isn't a good goal because your control over it is so limited.  Still, it hurts.

In theory, I should be able to find value in myself and my existing relationships.  I do think that if I was meeting other goals that I'd feel better about myself.  I have ADHD, which makes any sort of focused effort difficult or arguably impossible.  My OCD also insists on incredibly high standards.  I'm absolutely merciless with myself.  I can never do anything well enough to feel satisfied.

I've always been very lonely.  I'm lucky now that I have good friends, but it just isn't enough for me.  I feel so hopeless on a day-to-day basis, my shortcomings and loneliness chasing each other around and around in my head.  It's quite maddening.  A big fear of mine is that I've taken too long trying to create the circumstances for me to be successful in life and as a result I've just missed my chance at love, or at hitting the heights of achievement that my personality demands.  Therapy, meds, years spent studying, all so that I could feel good about myself, but I can't even handle that.  I don't even believe in searching for ways to meet people because even if I could locate women I was attracted to, there's no way I'd try to forge a relationship with them.  Why would I expect them to want to date me?  I sure as hell wouldn't.

Thoughts/comments/etc are welcome.  Thanks for reading.",depression
"Do I have depression? I'm not looking for a diagnosis or anything I just want to know if people with the disorder think I could potentially have it since diagnosis is pretty impossible for me due to how dogshit mental health services in my area are.

"i want to be better i am a university student in my final year. it has taken me six years to reach the end of uni. i only have 4 subjects left spread out in two semesters and i want to do my absolute best.

i am aware that i do not function as optimal as i want myself to be. i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder early 2024. i try not to be too cruel to myself and remind myself constantly that i am making baby progress from the way i was before (cannot finish requirements, had to retake subjects over and over). now, i am frustrated because the pace of our subjects is ever increasing and since the semester started two months ago, i am slowly losing the energy. this coupled with the responsibilities i have as the eldest child who takes care of her siblings (one has multiple psychiatric diagnoses, has very labile emotions).

i am really very frustrated because a simple task takes too long for me to do. a while ago, we have a group activity and i was not able to help out much because a small task takes a lot of brain power for me to do.

now, i am on antidepressants for almost two years. i switched from 4 medications already. my anxiety is at an all time high too and my psychiatrist want me to shift medications again. currently i am taking a high dosage of agomelatine, 2 1/2 tablets everyday and it burns my wallet to purchase such an expensive medicine. i also want to be able to keep up with school. please help me and give me advice.

"Is it normal to swing wildly between wanting to live and wanting to die? I've been on venlafaxine for nearly two months now. I've had more luck with this medication than any others I've tried before, but really that just means it's had any measurable effect on my mood at all. At first I had a massive boost of energy and I felt hopeful for the first time in well over a decade. I think about my future, and what kind of career path I should take, steps for self-improvement, I go for walks and have even started reading again. But sometimes my mood shifts back to how it was before, and everything seems pointless and worthless, and I just want to go into the woods and let the Earth reclaim me. It's like the medication has caused a civil war in my mind, my mood shifts wildly from day to day, sometimes even I'm hopeful in the morning and depressed by the evening. The medication has boosted my overall mood but now it's inconsistent. Has anyone else on venlafaxine experienced this?",depression
"Why do People don't like me in Long ruin and everyone dominate me ? So it's a long time around from my school till college I am just exhausted of the happening 😞. I am in my 2nd year of B.Tech. Earlier in school I was very alone and I don't used to have friends. This is because at first guys tend to get impressed and get friendly with me. But as time passes what suddenly happens they start ignoring me and trolling/roasting me 😞. I don't know why this pattern always continues that at first a person gets friendly with me and gets close then starts ignoring and roasting. Now I am a musician(singer,instrumentalist and composer also). So as soon as i joined music club everyone was friendly and one guy in first year told me to form our 1st years band but later he just ignored me 🥺and never ever gave a chance to come to the band which he formed ! Then I Just formed another band with other guys ! But still those guys in the first band always troll me indirectly. Its like that band formed first So as a first mover advantage they always gets some advantage from seniors not directly but indirectly ! But I and my band never 😔. So majority of my batch is in that band So i feel so leftover. Like why ? What do I do . 


Same thing in my music class... I used to be a great singer in my class and my teacher always used to appreciate me but due to pressure of studies and other things i couldn't continue classes ! Now in my 2nd year I started attending those classes again to complete my degree but yes due to lack of some pratice and observation from my teacher I developed some imperfections and wrong techniques. Now yesterday some seniors brothers made fun of that 🥺. I don't feel like to leave.


Same with my close friend in college.  He and me were best friends but another guy got in contact with us and soon he was giving priority to that guy rather than me and that other guy also started roasting!😔

Yesterday a music event was there a senior and my friend genuinely tried to ask and convince me to sing and they were so good because I never got that treatment and everyone used to ignore me.in the club 😔. But you know what the others singers were practicing not noticing me (sitting in a corner alone watching ) and I couldn't perform . And those two guys who asked me were busy in organizing the event so i couldn't 🥺.

I play keyboard also good ! But there exist a lead keyboardist who was just playing rhythm which I can easily play but guess what no one asked me to come and play. She played for 8 songs. I wanted just one because I am not like a keyboardist who is beginner and I always play in pratice sessions with appreciation but at the end time other one who is professional comes and dominates. Obviously that will happen but in club every instrumentalist gets a chance but why not I ? 


These things hurt me a lot. I am just exhausted not a good life everywhere just demoralising comments and negativity. ! I wanna die 😞. Help me ls",depression

"Lifetime depression  I’ve been depressed since I can remember. I remember being 5/6 and saying out loud that I want to die. Some times are better than others but it’s always looming over. My husband has recently become paralyzed because of his own drunken actions so now I’m his caregiver, and that’s already hard enough, but now he just takes his pain and frustration out on me. I don’t  even want to be around him anymore. I don’t even want to wake up anymore. 

At this point the only thing keeping me here is my cat. We have other animals, but she is my baby and is very shy around strangers, kids, and other animals. The other animals could be adopted out or given to animals and thrive, but she wouldn’t. And of course he hates her. Doesn’t hurt her or anything just talks about how much he hates her. 

My house is a mess and I know when other people come over they judge me but I don’t care. I don’t care about just about anything anymore. The only thing I’ve ever wanted was to be a mom, but I’ve had 5 miscarriages, so I don’t see that panning out. Maybe for good reason. I don’t know. 

I’m usually genuinely optimistic despite everything, but it’s hard right now. I can’t even lean on my husband because he’s different now. Not talking about physically either. Just ranting I guess. And the world keeps spinning. ",depression

I grew with no friends for the majority of my childhood. Spent most of my days setting in a closet ruminating. I feel like this past 5 years when I've tried to make friends there always some undercurrent of dislike they have towards me.

"I don’t know if I’m cut out for life. I’m 24. I’ve been depressed and suicidal for a decade with brief reprieves. I got brain surgery for treatment-resistant seizures, did four years of college (enjoyed the first two years up until 2020), tried student teaching and dropped out, and now I work retail. I started out doing so well and working 40 hours/week. When I ran into a difficult manager, I switched departments in the store and cut my hours to 30 hours/week. My parents didn’t think I would “make it” working a FT job, but only because they know my history and care about me. 

I was and still am worried I won’t make it, either. The mental illness is only getting worse, the seizures won’t ever stop, and I have no social ties besides my family. And no desire to have any ties due to social anxiety and agoraphobia. My brain has a circuit that just defaults to suicide as the answer. As the holidays approach, I’ve been thinking about planning my death. I’m honestly so ungrateful. Every day I wake up, my morning routine is to mutter “goddammit, not again” and hit snooze.

I’ve had episodes of anxiety and agoraphobia in my life, and I’m in the middle of one now. I’m so sick of being alive; what has all my suffering been for? I’ve been getting this feeling of internalized anger lately. I’m irrationally agitated by everything, but only because I’m resentful about the prospect of suffering through 10-60 more years of this shit. I’m tired, and I want to go home.",depression
"I’m a failure 
I’m 19 (F) and I’ve truly done nothing with my life but fail at everything. I barely graduated high school and I only did because some teachers went easy on me. I’ve never had a job or even tried to get one because I mentally can’t handle it. I didn’t go to college or even try to plan a future for myself. The only reason I don’t live with my dad is because I’m on disability and they provided me with a home. My dad is my favorite person and I can’t be happy when I’m not around him and he helps support me financially and bought most of the things in my place. I have no friends because I hurt everyone and I spend my whole day lying around my apartment crying and wishing I could die. My dad always says he doesn’t care what I do with my life unless I’m happy but I know he sees me as a failure for not having a job or doing anything productive and I know he wishes I was normal and not so fucked up. I’m just so tired of being a constant disappointment to everyone but I don’t know how I’m supposed to get my life on track.",depression
"How do I respond?? (delete if not allowed) Im not sure if this the is the right place to post this, it's all I could think of. I myself have suffered from depression for years of my life, so I understand how it's like completely. But this is something I've never known how to go about. When someone tells you they want to kill themselves, how are you meant to respond?? convincing people out of committing suicide is so detrimental to my mental health, I genuinely cannot handle it. I normally say ""im here for you, please talk to me I want to help"" or something along the lines of that, but trying to convince someone to not kill themselves is extremely exhausting, I always go into extreme burnout and start feeling suicidal myself, its so triggering. But is my mental health really better than their life?? should I let them talk to me about it, hoping I can change something, even if it's super harmful to me? Someone said it to me today and I ignored them, I genuinely am not in the place to be able to talk about suicide and convince someone out of it, but now I feel like if they did kill themselves that its my fault and that I caused it, because I just sat there and did nothing. what do i do 😕",depression

"I can’t take it anymore 

Every single day I’m snapping. I genuinely feel like I am losing my sanity. My parents never stop yelling at each other. My mom screams at me every day about how I’m not enough and how I’m lazy and ruining my future and I never listen to her.

The issues that she’s talking about are not even close to as big as she makes them. I missed a deadline for like one scholarship and she’s saying I’m missing out on thousands of dollars and it’s all my fault even though I never heard about this deadline and neither did many of my friends because our counselor never mentioned it.

My grades are falling because of how hard school has gotten. I can’t keep up with this work. It’s too much. I can’t balance it all along with plan for college as well, it’s all falling apart part and I can’t stay on top of it and I just get screamed at more and more and more and more

When she yells it’s like it’s life or death, she’s like flailing around and almost in tears and growling through her teeth and it’s all over high school and trying to apply to colleges.

I’m only happy when I’m at school, and I never in a thousand years thought I’d say that because I genuinely despise school. But there im away from my parents. I can talk to my friends or the girl I’m going to date soon and it’s just a break.

But when I come home it’s the same every day. I sit in my dark room and stare at a wall and whisper to myself about how I wish things were different or how I can’t stand anything anymore.

I used to be so focused on myself in self improvement but I don’t have any fucking time if I put time into anything but school then it all falls apart and I’m screamed at again

My parents blame it on video games but I barely even play them anymore I don’t have time or want to they just make up anything to shift it on me

I’m tired of sobbing every night or staring blankly at my wall imagining if things went different I can’t do this anymore

I’m trying 4x harder than I ever have but struggling more than ever idk how much longer it’ll be before I snap I feel like I’m about to break

I keep stealing alcohol because some nights it’s the only thing that lets me feel what my true thoughts are without the clutter of this constant worry

If it weren’t for my friends and my girl and my personal goals I might’ve tried to end it by now",depression

I wish someone helped me to end it, it's difficult for me to do so, I'm a coward. Whenever I try, I just can't do it. I'm a failure even at something this simple.

"People only like me for what I can do for them I feel as if though people can only tolerate me when I’m useful to them. 

All the friends or boyfriends I’ve had in my life only ever liked me for things I could do for them, not liking me for who I am as a person.

They couldn’t care less about the small things about me. They don’t ask me how things are going. Nobody wants to know anything about me because they don’t actually like me.

What they like about me is the things I can do for them. Giving them emotional support, being someone who replies right away, reliable. I’m the person they can go to when nobody else is there. 

And of course, boyfriends only like me for my appearance.

Co workers are only nice to me because I do a good job and will take their shifts for them.

But what would happen if I had become let’s say disabled, couldn’t walk and had my looks ruined. I can no longer do all those things for them anymore. And of course they would stop talking to me because I am no longer useful to them anymore. Not one person would stay with me because it didn’t matter what exactly I could do for them, but how impactful I make their life. My interests, thoughts, ideas, jokes, are what make them stay with me.

I don't have goals or ambitions. I don't have a dream job or anything. I'm not particularly good at anything, im just average. I don't excel at anything and I don't have the energy to care anymore. I'm failing almost all of my classes, but I find myself just not fucking caring anymore. there's no reason for me to try if there's nothing ahead of me.

I plan on killing myself as soon as I finish college because I feel like that's the end of it. the rest of my life would just be working a dead end job somewhere I hate. i have no desire to get married. I have no desire to have kids. all of the things that people say make life worth living simply don't appeal to me. I have almost no friends and I'm frequently outcasted.

"why do i always get bullied Everyday when I go to school Im always made fun of and my feelings arent taken seriously. People always make a joke of me like im not a real person. Ive never said anything except the usual retalliation like shutup or I try to think of something I can make fun of them with but they seem unphased and just say something like nice one mate or just laugh. I cant go one day with being reminded of my past mistakes or my facial features. These people I once called my friends would mock me on my ""yellow teeth"" or my ""big nose"" and sometimes petty things like why do your eyebrows look waxed. I simply pluck the hairs on my unibrow because I take care of myself. It feels like every detail about me has to be pointed out. I hate it and its constantly happening everyday and never changes. People say things to me about my hair saying how it looks boxy or like im trying to get fluffy hair. I just have brown short hair with a fringe. Ive never said anything bad or done anything bad to these people. Ive never mocked anyone or been rude. But simply im always the target for jokes and mean words.Somebody once said to me I have no subtle features and that all my facial features stand out. Due to it being winter my lips always get cracked from the cold weather and ofcourse I put vaseline. And ofcourse a couple people have to point out that it looks like I got punched or somebody slit my lip in half and that ""You need vaseline bro"". And always people bring up things like ""atleast I didnt get beat up by a ginger"".Im so ashamed of myself for being peer pressured into a fight. I had never fought before or had combat training. I swung a punch and he ducks and punches me in the face. I take a step back and swing again but im stopped by a teacher. Maybe about 100-200 students were watching me get hugged by the teacher and the other person staring me down. I feel like im always the centre for hate. Im made fun of repeatedly for being rejected by girls and failed relationships. I was being laughed at today because when I sat down in class my trousers were pulled up just enough to see my ankles. I shower everyday but apparently they just look funny or something. I was wearing ankle socks and standard kickers yet I heard someone say ""look at his shoes"". Honestly, Ive never ever told anyone about my problems and I always bottle them up. Ive never lashed out or cried or any of the sort. Recently, this girl I know but have never spoken to didnt invite me to her birthday. This might seem petty but it really hit me how all of my ""friends"" were invited and I wasnt. I was sat a home all alone with nobody to talk to watching them have so much fun on their instagram stories. A while back I asked my teacher if I could sit next to one of my friends I respected. She let me sit there aslong as we behaved and we did. But recently he asked to move to sit next to someone else. I soon realised how I was nobodys 1st option and not even their 2nd or 3rd. I felt like I had no friends in the world. I sit alone in that class now and In the mornings during form I also sit alone. That friend who moved away even said to me he asked to move and that ""your gonna be alone now"". My ""friends"" almost never respond to my text messages and if they do it's late. Im literally depressed yet noone seems to care enough to notice. Around 2 years back I started training in the gym and I have been keeping at it quite inconsitently. A couple months on a couple off. I still havent seen any progress. The most progress I have seen was when i was eating good and went around 5 times a week for 6-7 weeks. My biceps and chest were growing slightly. I even started fapping less and playing videogames less. I spent more time with family and even went out with a girl for the first time. We went to the park and cuddled on the bench watching the ducks on the lake. But then, I went on holiday and this girl stopped talking to me as much. We eventually fully stopped communicating after 3 weeks and I wasnt sure why. Later on when I get back I message her. Apparently she has a boyfriend. I tell one of my ""friends"" and I deeply regret this as im always made fun of now for being ""cheated"" on even though we was never dating. While I was on holiday some of my gains were still there and my strength but I started fapping again and I wasnt training. This 5 week long holiday I was just playing videogames and not even having fun. It was a new low and when I got back I tried going to the gym and getting into the rhythm again but I couldnt. So I just started playing games all day and fapping not even brushing my teeth every night. I would stay up all night and sleep all day. Eat junk food and become lazy. By this point I had lost all my gains and strength and anything good about me. It could be a new low. When I was younger I achieved consistently high grades and was praised for being smart. But now Im always late to school missing around 2 hours im the morning and my grades are getting much worse.

Ill continue this if it gets attention and anybody if actually reads this.But right now its getting late and my fingers are tired from typing. If you have read this far THANK YOU it means so much that you are a considerate and thoughtful human being.

"Can depression manifest only in chronic fatigue ?  4 years ago (2020) I was diagnosed with burnout/depression/anxiety, they didn't really know.

After trying 7 antidepressants with no success on my main symptoms, towards the end of 2021 a psychiatrist suggested my symptoms were likely due to long COVID. I got refered to a long covid clinic and they diagnosed me.

"Body depression and the wonders of the human mind Hello all, I wanna start by prefacing that this could all be inaccurate or wrong but I'll Saya my peace and be done with it.

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder back in 2021

I originally started going to the doctor because I was dealing with some GOD awful brain fog that was seeming from seemingly nowhere

At the time, I knew I had depression and anxiety but it didn't affect me at all, it was just a little bag of sad I carried with me everywhere I went.

Fast foward to now 2024, my brain fog has cleared mostly (yay) but it has been replaced with a HORRID feeling depression and I am now on 2 different meds for it.

My question is this, in the last sentence I said ""horrid feeling"" and that's because I've found something weird with my depression- or so I think, my mind, like inside my brain, is calm, completely fine, loves myself, and nothing is really going wrong in my life and I've never really had trauma..HOWEVER my BODY feels depressed and exhausted and ONLY my body, it's not just a sick feeling, like I know it's depression just cause it's so heavy and taxing and everything feels off.

Have any of you experienced this? Is this a thing or am I going crazy? Is there anything I can do?

"Is it possible to heal from so much pain? Hi everyone,

I’m 35 years old and have dealt with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, never really finding my place in the world. My family situation is complex: my father is demanding, emotionally unavailable, and preoccupied with money. While he has done some good things, he often uses emotional blackmail. My mother is distant, easily influenced, and unable to connect with her own emotions or with her children.

I am the main caregiver for my parents, which my brother exploits to disappear for months without so much as a phone call. This absence leads to increased pressure on me, with my parents, especially my father, taking out their frustration on me. He has even told me that I am a burden in his life.

My younger brother, after a troubled childhood, seemed to stabilize following years of therapy. However, at 27, he withdrew from life. For the past five years, he’s been living in a house owned by my parents without permission, largely absent except for sudden, violent appearances and threats of suicide. He accuses us of failing him and emotionally blackmails us, stealing money and creating an ongoing crisis.

Personally, I have endured a lot. Bullying during my childhood led to binge eating, which resulted in obesity for most of my life. This brought ongoing self-esteem issues, challenges in forming relationships, and repeated episodes of depression and anxiety. I also have a history of sexual abuse that has left both emotional and physical scars, including chronic vulvar pain and lichen sclerosus from untreated infections in my youth. Despite all this, forming healthy friendships has always been difficult because I lacked positive role models growing up. My only romantic relationship was traumatic, and I am still recovering from it.

Over the years, I have struggled with intense suicidal thoughts—not as a cry for help, but because I felt unvalued and unloved, as if I didn’t matter to anyone. This desperation pushed me to seek help from numerous psychologists, but the results have been disheartening. During the pandemic alone, I went through four therapists, and this year, I’ve seen two. One therapist I stayed with for 2.5 years, but I had to leave because he judged me for taking a leave from work and pressured me to find another job, even making inappropriate comments about my brother. The second therapist insisted that I report my brother to have him committed, which only added more stress.

Recently, I started seeing a new therapist, but once again, I feel disappointed. She forgets important details, interrupts me when I’m speaking, and makes inappropriate comments. She hasn’t shown basic empathy, even after I shared details about my physical health problems that have significant psychological impacts. Although she practices EMDR effectively, the first part of the sessions feels disconnected, and her attitude lacks validation. As a patient, you can tell when someone isn’t fully present, which is disheartening.

I am currently on medical leave due to mental health issues, but I am required to return to work next Monday, and I fear that I will be dismissed. This week marks my final session with my current therapist, but I already know I cannot continue with her.

At this point, I feel very lost and unable to see a way forward, either with therapy or in general. I share my experience hoping that someone can relate or offer support. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

"feeling stuck and need help and advice i’ve dealt with depression and anxiety my whole life. These are just by products of having adhd as well. But the last 4 years it has caused MAJOR anxiety disorder and depersonalization. I’m at the point where even if i’m not feeling anxious or depersonalized then i just ask myself, do i even want to be here? what’s the point of life i don’t see any reasons especially if im just going to be stuck with this feeling forever. I know these are just thoughts and that this is a mental illness. I’ve never tried any anti depressants or stimulants for my adhd. The only medicine i’ve ever been on long term is busiprone for anxiety. I really need advice has anyone ever been stuck like this and recovered and gotten out of it? please do not comment any negative things or anything that will make me feel less hopeful. i really need some advice. Anyone had good experience with anti depressants? Has anyone else had depersonalization or anxiety from prolonged depression? Any tips and ways to recommend getting better? Thanks! ",depression
"Things I tend to do/feel * When I'm out with friends/Family, I have so much fun, and feel great about myself, but when I'm back home in my room is goes down the drain. 
* I feel guilty when the weather is nice, but I stay home.
* I nap to make the days go by faster. 
* I am proud of my friends when they achieve/do something for themselves, but It makes me hate myself even more.
* I trauma dump in a way that makes it look like I'm just joking.
* I'm no longer religious.
* I won't buy food for myself or clothes because of finances and trying to be more responsible, but then I'll buy a $42 vape and call it a day. 
* Quitting vaping will probably make me feel a lot better, but I've convinced myself that it's the only thing that is actively making feel good.
* I used to make fun of people that were going through depression and the likes when I was younger (not directly). But I've now come to understand that it isn't all just bullshit.
* I try to help my friends with their problems, but refuse aid for myself.
* Going to the gym/ losing weight and eating healthy isn't really doing anything for me. I still feel like shit
* I can't sleep because I pressure myself to sleep
* I should be proud of my achievements, and things I've done in life, and things that I am actively doing. but I don't feel proud. I tell myself that it's what a ""normal person should be doing"" or ""should have done already""
* I try taking accountability for my fuckups, but it's a lot easier to blame other people.
* Self deprecation makes me feel better about myself for some reason. Even though I know that it's only making it worse. 
* I've learnt that everyone has a story. Some worse than others, but a story none the less.
* I'm scared of dying. Fearful of death, but I don't want to be here anymore. Or maybe just disappear   

Anyway just rambling on. This is coming from a 24 year old. There are a lot more but cant be fucked writing it down. I'll journal it instead. I'm trying, not my hardest, but I'm trying. Have a good day",depression
"in a bad depressive episode rn  i’m 22F diagnosed w MDD, ADHD, GAD and i have a few depressive episodes every couple months. It’s 5pm and i haven’t gotten out of bed or eaten today, i’m in the same clothes i fell asleep in yesterday. I took my meds but i can’t make the thoughts go away. For some reason when i get bad like this i convince myself that everyone in my life is a bad person. Like right now i have been ruminating on the thought of breaking up with my boyfriend bc of stuff we have literally gotten past. I convince myself he’s a terrible person and that i should just be alone because my brain tells me he doesn’t actually love me. I hate my best friend right now. I texted her this morning bc i was feeling sad and really alone. I asked if she could hang out and no answer. Few hours later i text again asking if she wants to go with me to the gym. No answer all day. i text again saying “ok never mind” and i just feel angry. This happens every time it gets bad and i can never tell if its just my depression brain feeding me lies or if its true. I convince myself that i dont deserve to live. I hate feeling this way i dont know what to do. I just started 10mg vilazodone, today was my second day and so far just nausea and headaches. i’m so tired, im doing everything im supposed to and nothing is working. Im sure everyone in my life is tired of hearing that im STILL depressed and i can’t just snap out of it. ",depression

I was stupid, and didnt log into my online college for a few days, because of course I got into halloween fun, procrastiation, and doomscrolling. Now the day after my birthday, when my parents showered me in gifts, I finally log on to see that I was dropped due to inacivity. Im a moron. Im on vet benifits, and now I might've wasted my parents money. I had a simmilar issue a few months back, and was failing. I dont know why im such a dumb, lazy pig, or why im such a procrastinatior, or what to even say to my parents.

I wanted to do education but I want money without having to get a side job or anything. I’m not smart in math, science, medicine, or anything having to do with law so i just don’t know what to do. 

This desire didn’t start until recently and i think i’m becomeing obsessed with it. I want to be a model so bad, except i’m 5’4 and plus size. This has led me to compare myself to everyone and everything in my life. I can’t look at a girl I know and see something about her that I envy. I even envy people younger and older than me. I can’t even fucking listen to music or watch youtube videos anymore because i’ll start crying and feel pathetic compared to the person. 

I feel like i was just destined for nothing in life. I want things i can never have and I don’t know what to do about it. I have social anxiety and am so uncharismatic and don’t know where to start. I don’t even feel like i can start now because i’m always busy and if im not busy im just tired or procrastinating now.

"I keep forgetting that I'm not a person. Of course, there are moments when I can genuinely feel happy, maybe even hopeful. I want to keep going, at least out of spite. I fool myself, letting myself think that there can be a way out of this, but then it engulfs me whole, reminding me how pathetic that really is. 

""Haha. How could someone like you wish for anything other than death? Isn't that what you really want, anyway? To give up?"" - coming from within.

Often, it's really just that - fleeting moments of ""joy"", and I get greedy, even if they're caused by something unhealthy or dangerous, because I'm grasping at straws. That's all I know.

It's hard to remember the last time I could properly focus. Almost like brain fog, but rather complete darkness, with barely a silhouette of a concise thought appearing once in a while, quick to fade. My memory is non-existent, even if I try to train it. I can't make decisions on my own, because I have zero self-esteem and don't care about anything, I don't have any goals, skills, achievements, self-esteem or dreams. Not sure if I even have feelings. 
And yet, sometimes I feel like I'm a person. Like I could function as well as any relatively ""sane"" human being. Like if I just tried harder, I could become someone. Then I realise it's ridiculous, then I feel like I could actually end it, instead of putting it off for ""some day"", but something always gets in the way, I distract myself, pretend like I'm not constantly having a mental breakdown in the back of my mind, and repeat that over and over and over again, for years, because I'm that much of a worthless, stubborn, and foolish coward.",depression
"Already depressed and then losing someone from your support system. We met each other at a mental health hospital at the beginning of the year. She was there for a very different reason then the rest of us but we bonded pretty quickly. Not long after we'd both leave the hospital but kept in contact. We both needed that emotional support. Months would pass and I'd completely stop telling her about the bad things I had going on in life and how I actually felt. Would just deflect to a different topic even if she asked. She on the other hand would continue to do it and I did the same thing as before, I'd give her advice and console her. I didn't like telling her about my issues because i dont really like just trauma dumping on people. I have trust issues and in particular when it comes to women so i kept the majority of our friendship pretty 1 sided in terms of how ope 
and close we were. She'd grow to view me as an older brother or a father figure due to me being the only man in her life aside from her bf. I never really liked how she'd tell me that cause I knew it was an issue due to her having a bf so I never fed into it. Tbh I'd deflect to avoid continuing down that course which can lead to drama.....it did. She'd tell me one day how she got into an argument with her bf and he'd call her a bum for needing his car to go eat, go out, and go to work(they have the same job at his parents new fast food spot). The insults turned into pretty awful things such as wishing her head would be bashed in and she'd go incapable because then she'd be easier to deal with. That turned into threats as according to her she'd grab something that belonged to him and he told her to give it back or he'd hurt her. Thankfully he didn't but in the end he'd lock her out of where they essentially lived(the pool house of his parents home) and she'd cry for awhile before he let her back in. Same as always I'd give her advice as I knew she did some things that didn't help in this argument of theirs but I also had to voice my anger over what was said. After a few days she'd tell me she can't talk to me anymore as she was told by him that she couldn't or else they'd break up. He had read the messages by going through her phone and gave the ultimatum. She was crying over this but I told her it was OK and maybe for the best. In an attempt to make herself feel better she'd tell me she'd only block me on her phone but stay in my social media without talking. I didn't really see how that'd help because if he found out we followed each other that'd create another problem. So I told her I'd block her and she grew even more sad and thought I must've been angry. I didn't feel any anger but it did hurt. She was apart of my support system. Whenever I felt low she was one of the people if contact. Never did I tell her what I felt or what caused it. Id keep it to simple small talk so most of our convos were just filled with laughter. I miss the friend that I had so I just used this along with the actual things that drove me to become depressed to continue my weight loss goal. When my support system isn't enough my job and the gym help in the end.",depression
"Should i tell my parents im failing out of college? Im a sophomore in college and Ive been depressed since last september, dealing with lots of anxiety and suicidal thoughts as well. My parents know im struggling pretty significantly mentally, but they dont really know 100% why. 

There are many reasons as to why im struggling mentally. One of my main reasons is my poor academic performance. I've been 100% honest with my parents as to why im struggling besides the fact I havent told them Im struggling academically. 

i was an A student all the way up until my first semester freshman year of college and for some reason everything fell apart for me from there. i figured that I could get it together academically on my own since I was a successful student in the past. I havent figured it out yet though and now i dont even know if i will. 

My GPA is a 2.2 (2.5 required to graduate), ive failed two classes and it looks like im about to fail a third (fucking calculus). My academic advisor told me that if I fail another class, there is a chance i get kicked out of school.

I wish i would've approached them when I was struggling originally now, but I was so afraid of the response from my parents that I didn't do it. Now im in a significantly deeper hole and I have no clue what to do. My dad can be a little bit of a hothead (not to say it wouldn't be warranted here), thats why Im having such a hard time approaching them. My mom wont take it well, but she will be there to support me without a doubt. I just dont know how my dad will react. Please help me, what do i do?",depression

Send me video with time stamp. Mean while my daughter whom I had custody of left to go back to her mom’s 1800 miles away.

"The lingering feeling is getting so much worse again Hello there everyone,
I’m gonna start off by saying I was at a therapist but she never really told me if I reallt am depressed I guess?
Moving on to my point, this lingering depression of mine is getting so much worse again. I’ve had this feeling mixed with overwhelmed anxiety since before the pandemic and really need to know what I can do. The best I can give an example of is how the author of “I want to die but I want to eat tteokkbokki” described the feeling in the prologue. It’s a great book if you don’t know it.

Basically I’ve tried everything—from therapy to stone/meditation therapy, from off time to trips, the only thing I never tried was medication because, as I said, my therapist never really got into talking about that.
I can’t explain the feeling well I just hate everything. Litterly everthing. My parents, my workplace, my sister and anything else. Hobbies are getting extremely boring again and all I wanna do is sleep and cry.
I’ve had this before and barely managed to get back into life—this was barely a year ago. 

Safe to say as a 15-year old who is legally required to either work or go to a school with specific interest, this is the absolute worst. I don’t have any passion about anything anymore at this point. I can’t talk to my mom about it because she has brushed me off all my life until i wanted to go to a psych ward on my own. She got me a therapist that didn’t help me at all and just kinda- brought me down? 
I feel like such a failure for not having any goals, I waste my time away but I know I just need a break of life. At least where I am right now—mentally and physically.

Sorry about the rant but I just really need someone to help me, I litterly can’t even get out of bed anymore. What can I try?:(",depression
"I want to die in 3 years I just recently turned 21 and for the longest time, I have not been the most mentally sound. I have no motivation to live, I feel incredibly hollow and empty. Being alone with my own thoughts with no one around me has been so bitter and lonely. The constant anxiety I have of fearing the good things happening now is just a temporary beautiful illusion, and will be shattered in the near future, just to be proven right time and time again, it’s so tiring. I’m tired of having my hopes brought up of brighter days just to be utterly destroyed and crushed. It’s suffocating that I have no one to scream to. It’s agonising knowing that I have hurt people I care for because of my instability. I can’t even enjoy my hobby of reading as after every few lines, I will stop and think about how mentally exhausted I am.

Aside from my parents, I don’t think many people will be sad once I’m gone. There will be the initial sadness, but it’ll be over pretty fast. I plan to die in 3 years as that’s the period where I will graduate with a PhD. I will fulfil my parent’s wishes and make them happy one last time, then I’ll leave. I have no motivation to continue anymore. This is my last push. ",depression

"I feel pretty awful I have a sickness that has shortened my life span, but that's not even what I'm overly depressed about. Maybe it's an underlying issue. I spent 6 days straight in bed last week, not even that particularly depressed feeling. Just didn't want to get out of bed. I'm rejected by romantic partners and friends constantly even though I try to be as kind as I can. This just leads to me being taken advantage of and is starting to make me feel like real trash. I don't want to go on. I have an appt with my psychiatrist next Wednesday, but what? Increased dosages? Med changes? Adding more meds? I take 4 for psychiatric conditions already. I feel lonely and isolated and unloved and today I'm feeling it more starkly than usual. Basically my only reason for living is that someone needs to take care of the cat. My only family are my parents and they live far away and even I can't get along with them for more than 2 weeks if I were to stay with them (psychiatric issues on their end, especiallymy mother). My parents think and treat me like I am an invalid. That is the only way they can cope and explain my problems. Part of it is me and part of it is being chronically misunderstood and just not worth anyone's effort.

Been dealing with anxiety since I was a child, depression/self harm since I was 12, medicated since 15 and am a 2 attempt chump (24 & 30). I'm 35 now.

For reference, I am diagnosed with bipolar I (depressive type), features of BPD, and anxiety (meaning basically all anxiety disorders - GAD, social anxiety, OCD, agoraphobia, other phobias, etc). Probable PTSD, but haven't been formally diagnosed. I have a psych degree so I know everything about my disorders and treatment options. Just can't seem to apply them consistently to myself.

Not to say there hasn't been improvement. Haven't cut since I was 29. Prozac was a real game changer after my second attempt at 30 and still has an insulating effect, just not always and today is especially bad. Feel like killing myself, but know an attempt would likely just land me in the hospital with brain damage (like the other 2 times), so not a serious consideration. Mostly just want to die and bedrotting.

I just feel worthless and wish I could just disappear. If I died in my apartment, nobody would even notice until the smell started. The only reason I'd be discovered earlier than that is if my mother threw a fit about a welfare check on me.",depression

No idea what I want to do as a job/ career. No idea if one day I want a family or not. What should I do with my life. I know we shouldn’t think about the future too much but we have to.

I don't have any drive, no motivation and no hope that anything will get better. I don't wanna think like this but it feels impossible not to...

Recently I've started to care less and less about my friends, their lives and whatever they're doing.

The friendships I hold onto so dearly are fake, it's not real, they don't even know I'm struggling, why tell them they won't even care. And before anyone tells me that they do, they don't... I've reached out before, asking for the bare minimum like ""invite me if you ever have a slot open"", really very bare minimum stuff. Yet they never invite me, I ask them if we're fine, they reassure me everything is but yet I'm never included in their lives. I've started to grow a lot of resentment to the people around me, I just feel like they don't get it. They don't ever try to help me, even when I mask my problems to make sure they won't get too affected and still they complain. Whenever I do take off the mask, giving in asking for some sort of sympathy I always feel ignored, they always tell me i'm ""too negative"", but I don't even let them see that side of me!? Literally I'm always the person who make the jokes, keeps the conversations going etc, I used to be more negative back in the day towards people but I just mask that stuff now. I don't ever let them see that side of me, or at least barely, how would they even know? I'm just so tired of it honestly, I just care less and less. ",depression

"i saved my boyfriend from suicide but i sometimes wish it didnt have to be me 
dont get me wrong, i (17F) love my boyfriend (16M). im so relieved he’s alive and i got to be there for him. but lately i feel more anxious and exhausted ever since the night it almost happened.  my boyfriend  is the sweetest boy i ever met. he was my bestfriend for 8 months before confessing and we secretly had feelings for eachother that whole time. we have only been dating for 2 months and it ended up being the darkest time of his life. but i know im not the reason, he has been battling with depression and anxiety his whole life. we just happened to start dating this time.

it happened on the night he was grounded by his dad and emailed me on his school laptop (phone was taken away) he said he really needed to talk so we zoom called. i answered and he was hyperventilating and crying, he told me about how much he couldnt take it anymore and had these pills laid out on his desk. i was terrified, i begged him to put the pills away as he continued crying. it took a while but i began to hear him put the pills back into the bottle. i asked again and made sure he put them away. he said he did, and he went off saying he would be back and left to the bathroom. he was there for so long i was terrified he took the pills, and i remember shaking and crying his name to answer me. in a panic i ran around my room and went to my mom and asked if i should call the cops which she said she doesnt know. i was panicking and terrified because he still wasnt responding. as i was about to call 911 he finally came back, and i nearly considered to not call them until he began having a very bad panic attack. i tried helping him calm down but i knew this was beyond me. i was so unsure what to do, and finally decided to call 911. my boyfriend was so scared when i told him i was getting him help to make sure he was safe. and it hurt me so much when he said he didnt want me to just because he was scared his dad would get mad. he deserves help and its terrible his dad didnt listen to him and it had to come to this point. 

i talked to the operator, and explained everything. they went to his house and helped him. but never reached out to me that night if he was okay and safe. so i was by myself in my own thoughts after my boyfriend hung up and the operator. it was the worst night i have had. i have never been so scared to lose someone like that, never felt so anxious in my life. thankfully the next morning he reached out after coming back from the hospital to talk to me.

he always tells me how i am the only person he can talk to about his mental health most comfortably, and how he relies on me. he does has other support systems now though, like his therapists and adults or friends in his life. yet ever since that night i noticed ive been very off. i consider myself to be pretty in control of my thoughts and emotions, but now i find myself feeling more anxious about little things in our relationship, and being mad at him or having serious conversations more often than usual. im always worried about him, and need to constantly make sure hes okay and im making him happy. which has honestly been slowly draining me. he talks a lot about his mental issues with me, and i always support him. now its been affecting me too though, and i get anxious thoughts that i usually never get. he knows this too. and offered breaking up so that im okay. but i told him i loved him for who he is and nothing could change the way i feel, so he cant make me go away. 

i know i saved him and its why hes alive today. so how do i stop this guilt i feel for feeling like i wish it wasnt me to save him from near death? should i see a therapist? i dont know if i should because he didnt actually commit suicide. but i’m feeling like its been affecting me and our relationship a lot, and i dont want to break up with him but i also dont want to keep feeling anxious and drained.",depression
"Emptyness, Sadness and Sorrow I look into the mirror and sometimes I feel I'm not ugly, I can be attractive, other times I just feel so inadequate and not so good looking since I'm always single and even when I date and try to find a new guy, all seems well at first and then the magic disappear for no reason honestly. I do believe it's better living in my own bubble, enjoying my fantasy in my bedroom, watching movies, spending sólo time alone as always, talking to myself, only interacting with people out there (at work and other small scenarios) and that it, return and go home in the darkness of my shade, hiding in my shell, closed up and only open up for myself and then repeat the same routine again the next day like pretending I have another life. A life that I could be successfully beautiful, with a fabulous red hair, dark blonde, light brown, amber, copper or green eyes, more extroverted and funny, great personality and goal oriented in any career. Other person that's is not me. It's wasted. I don't even know what I want to buy I guess I could be a good partner to somebody and even I have received compliments from other guys (online) I jumped the conclusion (after being ghosted several times) that they only said that because they have to say something and enjoy deceiving people (on the apps and real life) and that makes me reconsider that I'm not attractive after all. I'm averagely tall and skinny and pale but I'm not enjoying this person out and in that I am today. It's like when I close my eyes or ""dream"" awake, I want to believe I'm another person, way more interesting, prettier, funnier and better in exchange. It won't matter the genre/sex. I could choose a man or woman (perhaps a woman better) with entirely physical traits and better in everything and the saddest thing it that I am attached to this body and sohl for the rest of my life withkut even a single chance to enjoy the company of a good good looking man with great character like my ideal dream guy. I know that's never gonna happen and better start to get used to it from now on but I simply can't forget this feeling. It outcome my possibilities and brings me unhappiness. I really wish I was that girl/woman or boy/man and could choose and finally accept myself. I take some selfies and kinda like it with the right angle and post them but I remember this is not ""me"" inside and wish I could erase my identity once and for all  I'm sad. ",depression

Nothing I can do, except ponder whether or not to actually kill myself. There’s nothing for me nothing I can do. I am so depressed and I honestly forgot how horrible it was.

"I hate my life and I don't know what else to try to make it better I got SAed as a child by a family member and diagnosed with depression at 15.

I am now 23. I have been into therapy for a year now. I am also taking anti depressants. I try to keep myself as healthy and active as possible. 

I moved abroad a few months ago. I have a full time job here and make more money than my parents ever made (which is actually not enough when you try to maintain an social life in an expensive city nowadays). They are really proud of me. I am completing a second master degree online and plan to move again next year to complete
a 3rd one onsite (I am already enrolled).

I read books and listen to podcasts about mental health, self improvement, self love, relationship, manifestation ... anything you can think of. I try to work on myself as much as possible, be a good listener, be a better person/daughter/sister/friend.

I travel abroad for vacation at least once a year, which is a privilege. Often solo travelling. I solo traveled 4 times last year.
I attend concerts multiples times a year. I have amazing friends.

I attend sport classes twice a week and have a drink with my coworkers at least twice a once. I am also part of a girls group who organise events and I attend once a month to meet new people (wine tasting, ceramic painting, picnics, boat parties, candle making, movies night, etc.... huge variety of events). I try to be social. I also go to those ""timeleft"" diners once in a while. I do not use this app that much tho.

I speak 4 languages (not all fluently but enough for work/ daily conversations) and I am currently learning a 5th one.

I am conventionally attractive. I try to take care of myself (Skin care, hair care, spa once a month, nails).

With all of that, I still do not like my life. I find myself boring and I hate the way I look. I would like to litteraly disappeared. I always feel sad and empty. I am never enough. I always want more and to be a better person : be more fun, more smart, more pretty. 

I have never been in a relationship (only situationships) and men do not even look my way. Which is fine, male validation shouldn't be important for me but I have to admit I get envious of other girls who get all the attention and are effortlessly nice to hang out with.

I get attached to people really fast, which allow me to get hurt very often. I am over sensitive.

Most people my age do not really like me. I am always the one who find excuse to not go clubbing (deep down I hate it) or spend too much on alcohol (I could spend 100 euros in alcohol per night but my cheap ass refused to).

I do not know what else I can try to be better n'a more important: feel better. Any advices or tips is welcomed.

I can't do this anymore. I walk into a job that drains my soul and leaves me emotionally raw and I literally grind myself to the bone mentally to not fall apart in a toxic job and ALL OF THAT is for basically nothing.....I'm staying alive and pushing through because my boyfriend makes me happy, but I still can't shake this weight on my chest no matter what I do.

"I can't stop thinking about it. Yesterday morning , my fiance and I got kicked out of our place. My aunt who had always been by my side snapped and yelled horrible things at me. Blaming me for the 3K she CHOSE to spend on MY MOTHER no matter how many times back then I told her she didn't have to, that we'd be safe even if we get evicted, we had my fiances familys place to go to if we did(his fam wants us there for company). Well my mom lost her job and my fiance and I couldn't afford everything by ourselves so we broke the apartment contract and moved in with my aunt. We were originally gonna go live at my fiances family's place but my aunt INSISTED we move in with her so we can save better for our own car then move out to the place we have planned for our final moving place. That's really when things went downhill. She was a horrible house cleaner, her grown ass kids were horrible roommates but she never cared about what she or her kids did ok that's  your immediate family makes sense.But she apparently really cared if we messed up simple things. Here's some examples when she finally snapped yesterday before kicking us out: she said(screamed more like it) that i was manipulative because I claimed she did not set her boundaries before we moved in with her. She never communicated the rules like not leaving a dog blanket on the floor for the dog, not buying groceries ourselves for everyone, not bringing home free food. She hated apparently when we did that and never communicated that with us until she snapped.so apparently I'm the piece of shit manipulator(as she yelled at me). And as I stated earlier, she blamed ME for the money she spent on my mom and the fact we brought over our dog, blamed ME for the dog when my mom was the one who bought the damn dog when I told her we weren't financially stable for a dog. Blamed me for literally everything. And ok yeah why should I care if I get blamed for everything when I know it's not true? Her fucking reaction and way she snapped at me was horrid. She did not have to yell at me about how I'm a piece of shit. She did not have to blame me for everything and not let me have a say. Let's just say, her reaction and behavior was so bad that my fiance had to step in and he never does. He's come from a trauma filled past so he's used to abuse and stuff but he actually stepped in and defended me there when he hardly says a word against my family. And idk I keep telling myself that what my aunt said isn't true, i should just ignore everything it's not like I'm around her anymore. But I can't stop thinking about it.

So I put on a fake front and when they ask how I'm doing I say ""I'm doing fine"" because that's what they want to hear. They don't want to hear anything else.

They don't mind coming to cry on my shoulder, though. And then I have to brush them off, as gently as I can. Don't look to me for strength, I need every bit of it for myself. And when my strength isn't enough I stay away from people because solitude is what helps keep me grounded. Lately I'm needing a lot of time by myself. The meds aren't doing much for me anymore, but alternative meds have side effects I know I can't adjust to.

"My second attempt will be in January 
I've been depressed for ten years. I've already taken more than 10 controlled medications, seen numerous psychiatrists and psychologists. They think I'm bipolar, but I've never received a definitive diagnosis. I feel like a lost cause. Nothing makes me happy, nothing satisfies me, nothing catches my attention, I can't keep a relationship, I can't keep a job, I can't clean my room, I'm useless, I didn't even finished high school. Today, I admitted to my mom that I don't want to do anything with my life besides sleep. She didn't know how to respond, but I could see her disappointment. My father wants to send me to a psychiatric ward, and honestly, I don't care if he does. The only thing I can think of is suicide. I'm planning to do it in January, exactly a year after my first attempt. I don't want to live another 10 years with depression and don't want to be a burden to my parents, so I guess I have no other choice. All I know is there's something deeply wrong with me and I'll never know what it is.

"I feel so empty  I don’t even know where to begin. For as long as I can remember, it’s been ups and downs, like this endless cycle of highs and lows that never really ends. I’m 17, about to turn 18, and right now, I feel completely empty inside. It’s like everything that used to matter, everything I used to care about, has just… faded. And I’m left here, in this hollow space, not knowing where to go or what to do.

Every day feels like a battle with myself. I take antidepressants, hoping they’ll somehow help me feel better, or at least keep me from sinking lower. But it’s getting harder and harder. Simple things, like getting up to shower or opening a book to study, feel almost impossible. I know they should matter, and I keep telling myself to just push through, but it’s like nothing has any meaning anymore.

I don’t know if anyone else has felt like this—so empty that even basic things lose their purpose. I’m reaching out because I just don’t know how to face it. Have any of you gone through something like this? How do you deal with it? How do you keep going when it feels like nothing is worth the effort?

If you’ve found a way through, I’d love to hear it. Maybe just knowing someone out there understands could make things feel a little less heavy.",depression
"Depression is killing me and I’m making plans Ive been depressed my whole life. Ive thought about suicide for 20 years. I started giving away my stuff. I sold my car today. I’m boxing up my house.

I don’t know how or what I’d say again. People just can’t talk about things to help. I’ve been to therapy, groups, I’m medicated, I’ve been to the hospital. I am a kind and selfless person but I can’t be a good person if I hate myself. I know some of you will even call me selfish for wanting the pain to be over. I know it’ll hurt some people but I’m making it as easy as I can for others and shouldn’t there be a level of acknowledging I wouldn’t be suffering anymore? I feel like a failure and I know I’m not. I know I think differently than others, I know I’m not normal. I have my journal from 3rd grade with an entry saying I’m not like everyone else. Ive been sad forever. I hate living for other people and I’ve tried so hard to want to live for myself. I’m such an asshole for feeling this way and maybe putting people through pain.

I’ve accepted that happiness isn’t coming back I’ve worked hard to feel okay again, but that spark just won’t return.

I don't have much friends. No hobbies. No Girlfriend. I don't interact with most of my family. I am pretty much a loner. I used to enjoy video games or tv series. Now, I can't even seem to enjoy those. I can't motivate myself to workout. I eat just enough for me to survive. I don't even like eating anymore. I am so weak that I get minor tremors sometimes due to deficiency.

All I have left is my job and the money I have saved. I have saved so much money in a short time , I don't even know what to do with it. I don't feel any happiness when I get a hike or promotion or a bonus. I don't feel any joy when I buy things even for myself. I feel nothing. Just empty.

"Someone help me. Scared feeling of going crazy

Hi, I’m 18(m) and I just created this account to post this. I haven’t attended school since summer. And I’m scared of going crazy/insane. When I leave the house, I get a lot of unwanted thoughts. When I bike to school I get constant extremely weird thoughts. For example, what if I crashed into that car over there? Or: what if I just killed myself right now? I’m scared, I don’t want to think about these things at all. 

The further I am from home, my safe space (bed) I get extremely anxious when I focus on the fact I’m not home. I’m scared of not being able to move my way back home (my limbs literally not wanting to move) over the last year, when I think about moving my body. I just feel weird about it. Like, how do I move? How am I able to move? That gets me all weird and scared i that won’t be able to move anymore. Like my brain just can’t do it anymore.

Whenever I see someone kill themselves on the news I get scared. What if I become like that one day? What if I lose control one day and do something weird? 

Other than that, the thoughts can also intensify at school, or when I’m with someone. Like, what if I punch this person right now or what if I just pull my pants down? My thoughts are always there and it’s hard to avoid. I’m hopeless, and don’t know what to do. I don’t wanna feel like this, I just want to live a normal life not rotting in bed all day. However, when I’m gaming or doing something intensive, my attention drifts away and I don’t think about it. 
Also, weirdly enough, whenever I feel uncomfortable, I get the urge to touch myself. Idk why this is.

These annoying thoughts, combined with panic attacks, make it really difficult for me to function normally in this society. It’s stopping me from getting a job, or even attending school.

Is there anything I can do? Am I going crazy?

"Having no one to talk to/ family problems I just got a call from the psychiatric clinic, telling me they can get me in next week. I was really exited to finally have a plan and move forward and I was exited to tell my mom about it because I literally have nobody else who I can talk to. She didn't even really listen and as always she started making it all about herself f.e ""hmm, I think I have an appointment on that day"", or ""so if you keep going from clinic to clinic you can just drop out of uni. It's a waste of our money and we finally want you to be out of the house so we can have our peace""....and more. 
It breaks my heart everytime I hear this from her. There is literally no support at all. My dad doesn't care and everybody just seems to not care and act like a child when I talk about serious topics. I can never be myself, always putting on a mask to make others happy.

No one wants me here. 
No one really cares.
I'm genuinely alone, no matter how hard I seem to try to make friends everyone leaves in the end, despite trying different approaches. I just can't seem to do it right. 
Maybe it's because I go through phases of wanting to speak, then burning myself out and wanting limited contact, but then I feel bad during those periods and want to speak again and it's a cycle. 

I also hate the way I look and everything I've done up to this point in my life. I feel like I've failed. I feel like I've done nothing worthwhile and am stuck in some loop of building myself up and falling again.

I genuinely hate all aspects about my life.

I also hate that sometimes, if I'm feeling happy, or just not sad, I worry about these feelings coming back but stronger. I worry about the thoughts of SH and ending my life. 
These thoughts become so strong sometimes I can't sleep because it's all I'm thinning about. 
To a point in which the other day I SH'd for the first time in a few years. 
I hate to say it felt good. 

I don't know what's wrong with me, I've been through therapy, I've spoken to concelors, I'm on medication and have tried different types.

Now to add to all of this my eyesight is getting worse because i have been diagnosed with  keratoconus so now there’s also the stress and fear of my vision deteriorating even more then it already has (ps : due to keratoconus i also can’t drive at night which is definitely not helping with my whole dating and crush situation lol) , you think this is over?

"I don’t know how to help my mom with her depression.  This is probably gonna be a little rough to read lol this is being written after a fight and I’m just feeling lost and unsure about how I can even help. I feel guilty for her being depressed because most of her problems stem from becoming a SAHM. Ik it wasn’t in my control but it’s hard not to when she talks about it being her biggest regret in life. She became a SAHM when me and my siblings were born bc she had a bad home life growing up and wanted us to have a present mom. She was a good mom and I’m thankful to have had parents that wanted to be around us growing up however now that we’re all grown up my mom is struggling. That decision has cost her from having a career as she’s been out of work now for 20+ years. She’s bored at home, has no friends, hates where we live (florida) and has no hobbies. 

Growing up I was always the therapist child who my parents told all their problems to (prob bc im the only girl lol). She has told me my entire life all about how much she hates my dad and how she can’t wait to die bc she’s so lonely and tired. Because she doesn’t have a job she has no money and can’t get a divorce bc she’d have nowhere to go. Their relationship isn’t abusive it’s just loveless. I try suggesting therapy, finding a hobby, at least TRYING to get a job (she insists it’s too late and doesn’t want to try) and at this point have no idea what to do. It’s extremely hard growing up and hearing about how miserable ur parents are 24/7 and having no power to change it. She doesn’t have support to turn to for these things so I feel like I need to help or listen to her but it’s just hard to hear. I’ve tried setting boundaries in the past that this isn’t healthy for her to tell me about their lack of a sex life and all their marital troubles but that makes it worst because she starts crying about being an awful mom and self isolates. She’s constantly mentioning wanting to kill herself (idk how serious she is or if it’s a call for help) and I am just so lost on what to do. This is also really affecting my own mental health and I don’t know how to help.

I get very suicidal a lot of the time and I have the attitude of “I didn’t ask to be born so why should I suffer and stick around just so other people aren’t sad?”. But I’ve realised this has also made me have the attitude that being alive and just surviving and being pretty lazy is enough and I get really frustrated (internally) when people put pressure on me to do more with my life and in my head all I can think is “I don’t even want to be here and I’m sticking around to stop other people grieving so why should I do more?”.

I’m really beating myself up over this because I didn’t realise how shitty this was, and honestly it’s just making the whole thing worse. I know outside of this I am a kind person and I do my best to help other people.

I'm a complete mess, I don't go out, I don't have friends, no motivation, nothing makes me happy and i'm just wasting my life and my youth away and it's all my fault and idk how to fix it or i have no energy to.

Now where to begin, I'm gay and I hate it, I've never been with a guy, cuz i'm afraid of being outed (i hooked up once  but i'll get to that), i hate that i have to lies to everyone cuz i feel like they would't accept me or even if they do i would not trut that they do, the truth is i don't accept myself. I hate seeing my peer being in relationships and being happy, goging out and all i do is go to my work (that i hate) and then come home and rot in bed, i'm super jeleous of everyone. I feel like i don't belong anywhere and not just cuz i'm gay, i'm super boring and idk how to talk to people and keep the conversation going and i have nothing to talk about ciz i don't go anywhere so i don't have elike these crazy cool stories other do. I've never been to a club in my life it's like i don't know how to have fun, when i do meet someone i'm just quiet and i force myself to talk so that i'm not super wierd but all i do is say something stupid. I'm so sick of being alone like i litteraly can't take it anymore, i geel so fucking miserable and empty and tiered all the time. And i am trying but nothing is working, i tought when i get a job i will meet new people there and have a friend, well i got the job and at the job everyone is way older then me and an asshole, then i wanted to lear guitar and i started attenting leassons and i taught i will meet someone there but i habe 1on1 leassons so i rearly see anyone there and everyone at that school is better then me and yes i know i just started but i just feel like i don't belong there. Also what i regret not going to collage like i feel less worthy then people that go to collage i mean in defenetly not smart but maybe if i did go i would find friends there and have a better job i wouldn't hate. Also it makes me supper sad watching people traveling and having fun with their friends cuz i know i will never have that or i'd have to lie to them about the gay thing. Another thing i struggle with is sex, i mentioned i had one hookup and i am not a fan of hookups but i forced myself to do it just to lose my virginity, i felt less worthy then everonye else beacuse of my lac of experience like i'm a child or something, and it wasn't near my home town and i don't even know the guys name anymore (also i wish we at least stayed in touch but he wasn't very interested). I just feel like im not even human sometimes, like i'm stuckin in some cycle of misery that i can't escape and i will never be happy... suicide tought come to me like it's a joke, at least once a day i imagine what would it be like hanging myself or throwing myself of a high bulding, who would miss me? I don't think anyone would not truly ok my parents maybe but we are not super close like the other familys are, we barely talk and my mom often has a drinking problem and even if i did kill myself would they miss me as much if they new i was gay.

"Life is something. Remember when you were a child, you were promised all these dreams. When you were asked ""what do you wanna be when you grow up"" you most likely already had an answer. Maybe you wanted to be a doctor, an artist, a singer, a fireman, the opportunities were endless! And the best part was... everyone said it all could become true.

Now years later you're grown up and everyone around you is telling you to ""grow up"", ""you're not a child get an adult job"", ""it's impossible just give up!""... Where did that curiosity go? Where did those dreams go and why are everyone suddenly so against achieving them?

You're now in your apartment, alone, wishing you lived a different life... Maybe you're walking around circling for hours daydreaming away to a different life where you are what you dreamt of being as a child. You still carry that dream, you still deeply want it, but no one believes in you, maybe you don't even believe in yourself anymore. 

While you're dreaming of being anything imagination brings, you're at the same time telling other people that the dreams are unreachable. You're still telling others to ""grow up and get an adult job"". We are the creators of the circle, we are the creators of the demolishment of our dreams. We don't believe anymore, we dream but the belief that anything is possible is gone. To be fair, in this life without the right resources or contacts, it can almost be impossible, the dreams seem unreachable. How did we get here? Why are we still letting this go on? Aren't we all tired? I'm tired... I had a dream once, but it feels nothing more than just that, a dream... Life is something, isn't it...",depression

"I dont feel like myself  have a depression since a few years back and severe anxiety since i was a kid. i always try to distract myself by try to do something out of comfort zone. like going out, talk to people make a friends, put a smile on. and thats what i always heard from others especially on the internet that if you out of my comfort zone it's gonna be hard at first but then you'll get used to it and finally happy with what you were doing. and it first i it think it's working on me. because of that i got a good grade, good friends etc.

but now it hit me realisation that im just masking. and im not actually happy with what im doing. i always force myself to do something that i dont want to do so people don't think im such a pathetic loser. also, my family and friends never take me seriously when i talk about mental health because they always though lightly of me.

and then i start to feel like no one actually there for me. even now im mostly alone (i live with by myself and two roommate that we barely talk). no one ever ask me how I've been or am i okay. they mostly just assumed that im okay.

now im feeling like im drifting apart with everyone including me. the things that i do right now. doesn't feel like me at all. i dont even know who i am anyone. i feel like i want to run away from everything even from myself. it make me feel crazy to think how im stuck in this body. i feel so weird living in the body that im not familiar of.

"A friend of mine is truly struggling with depression right now and I just need advice  A girl I met roughly 2 months ago and I have become incredibly close lately. Recently, she opened up to me about some very terrible things she's been through that she has trauma from. She also has very strong depression or at least depression symptoms from the traumas she's endured.

Yesterday, she decided that she needs to self isolate from pretty much everyone to get her mental health straightened and of course I respected her choice. Apparently she's done this before and unintentionally ghosted people but she cares about me enough to where she doesn't wanna do that to me which is why she told me. Still, I'm just extremely worried because she's come to me with suicidal thoughts even just in the time I've known her.

I myself have struggled with depression most of my life, never to the extent she is right now tho. Not to play the ""suffering Olympics"" or anything. I'm honestly not sure how to help her other than simply giving her the space she says she needs. She promised to eventually come back to me so that gives me a bit of hope, and the fact that she's done this before and came back stronger. 

In general I just simply need advice on dealing with this situation. It's weighing heavily on me because I care about her a lot, she's probably the best person I've met in a long time honestly. She doesn't deserve any of this but I know mental health doesn't care what you ""deserve"".",depression

"Am I just pathetic? This will be long, I'm hoping context might help. I don't know what I want from posting this really.

32F suffered with depression, low self esteem and suicidal thoughts since I was 13 years old.

14 months ago, my Dad had a near fatal heart attack. 
Two weeks later, my partner of over 12 years ended our relationship. 
About 2 months after that, I started a new job; I thought a fresh start might be a good distraction. 
I moved back in with my parents in March The house I owned with my ex finally sold in August (we had some buyer issues which prolonged the sale process).
I left the new job just over a month ago because I wasn't happy there and I thought leaving might kick me into gear to figuring out what to do next.
Throughout all of this, contact with the ex was amicable which made logistically separating easy to navigate. But eventually I decided still having contact with them was too hard now we had no reason to talk. So a week after I handed in my notice, we arranged to meet to check there was nothing else to sort out before agreeing to no further contact. They told me during this meetup that they'd been lying and keeping secrets the whole time we were together- I have felt insane since finding this out, I can't stop obsessing over everything. I feel like an idiot- the relationship ended a year ago- shouldn't I be over it all by now?! 

Despite the last year, I am incredibly fortunate; I have a safe place to live, supportive family, a couple of friends, financial stability. 
But the depression and suicidal thoughts are the worst they've ever been. Since I left my job, I barely leave the house. I don't know what to do, I don't know what I like. I feel like I have nothing to offer anybody and I'm just draining everyone around me.
I have a couple of friends but they have their own lives and relationships so I don't want to burden them, and when I see them I don't feel like I should talk about how I'm really feeling because I have so much to be grateful for, I'm just pathetic for being like this.

I don't know how to get out of this mindset, it just keeps feeling worse and worse. I truly believe that everyone would be better off without me.",depression

EXCUSES!!! 
Already showered, and going on a walk. I don’t know what started my depression, been talking with therapists for the last year. I know what’s making it unbearable to live, and I know the only way through that is moving forward and living. Hope this lights a fire under someone. You are not your depression.

"I want to choose myself for once I started going to gym as a friend of mine recommended that it is a great way to help me deal with stress. I did even though my parents disapproved.

I have a bad lifestyle. I felt like living just for anyone to use. I want to improve that as I want to start living again, but for my own. I have suicidal thoughts and no one knew about it. I have been silently fighting my own battles as I don't know where I can get help. I am stressed, I am drained. I don't know anymore....

Going to that place, I have peace. Weeks of trying, I never knew I could love myself. But for them, it was a selfish thing to do.

Seek family help? They won't ever help me and rather see me die then help me. 

Financial Consultation? That would make debt even worst as they will charge you with high interest repayments.

Real estate/Sales? Did that before but I failed it miserably with 0 sales. I don't have sales skill and very bad with talking.

"I need suggestions Hey all

I’m really struggling at the moment and would really appriecate some suggestions to help pull myself out 

I’ve struggled with depression my whole life. Sometimes situational, sometimes not. I’ve been in bad relationships, been the bad guy and been the victim. I’ve suffered some major losses the past 3 years and I am in therapy working through grief and trauma, in amongst other things.

I dropped out of my tertiary studies because the industry was awful and frankly not for me. Took a year off to ‘figure out’ what I wanted to do and spent around 3 of those months with a retail job.

Currently, I’m studying and jobless. I still live at home so money isn’t an issue. The study is completely online, and there’s no connection. Not even online lectures or zoom calls. Initially I didn’t think this would mess with me as I finished high school the first year of Covid. But right now I am just feeling so incredibly isolated. I’ve developed quite severe health anxiety which I never experienced when my life was more ‘normal’.

I have 1 close friend who’s amazing, but other than that I just have a few mates who I don’t share that same deep connection with. I barely ever leave the house as I have no real reason to. I’ve lost all motivation to study, I’ve started isolating again. I fall asleep between 3:30 - 6:00 AM most days and try my absolute best to get up before 1 PM. Most days I’ll only eat dinner and some days that’s all. Other days I’ll binge on crap (entire bags of snacks). I pretty much constantly have a headache and it’s pretty obvious why. I have no routine and feel like there’s no real reason to develop one.

I’m just starting to feel like I’m suffocating. I want so badly to have a good life, I have an idea of the job I’d like to have once my study is over. I know I want a healthy relationship, my own place in the city and to own my own animals someday. I’m just so terrified that I will never get there and will feel this way forever.

Other than therapy (that I’m already in), the only other thing I’ve thought of is to set aside an hour a day to colour in with no phone allowed.

Other than that I feel completely lost and helpless, and would appreciate any suggestions.",depression
"Partner with Depression Hi everyone, I’m really looking for some help here and I don’t really know who else to ask at this point, any and all advice welcome.

*Context* I started dating a guy last January, we started off relatively casual but have been dating exclusively and pretty seriously since the end of May. This whole time I’ve known he’s really struggled with his mental health and depression, to the point where he has gone on medication and has started weekly therapy. I was really happy that he’s taking steps to improve these things, and I support his choices completely. 

Basically at the end of September I had a chat with him that I would like to be officially boyfriend/girlfriend, to which he said he didn’t feel ready because he felt like he couldn’t put me first because he’s still feeling in such a bad place with his depression. I accepted this and frankly, it’s just words, I’m happy with what we’re doing and where we’re at. I’m not asking him to put me first at all, I want him to get better, I just want to be with him. 

*Issue*
Last night he wanted to have a chat because he was worried that we hadn’t talked about the ramifications of him not being ready for me and my feelings. He opened up to me a lot about how he’s feeling really helpless, he doesn’t feel like the drugs and therapy are helping at all and he just feels terrified and broken. He also was talking about how he was terrified of losing me and didn’t want to hurt me, but he’s scared that he’s not putting himself first enough and it’s going to end up with him hurting me, leaving me, and fucking everything up.

I really tried to comfort him, I cannot stress enough that I just want to be with him, the good, and the bad. I’m totally in love with him and I want to help him through this. But I just felt like I was saying the wrong thing, he didn’t want me to say I’m by his side and if he’ll let me I won’t be going anywhere. But I don’t know what he did want me to say. 

I asked him if he was breaking up with me and he said he wasn’t, he was having this chat to actively avoid having a break up cause he loves me as well, but he’s just terrified and doesn’t feel in control.

He repeatedly told me how terrified he is of losing me, not getting better and how bad his brain is. When I would say I just want to be there for him he kept saying I’m not understanding. 

I just really need some advice because frankly, I’m out of my depth. I just want him to believe me when I tell him I love him and I just want him, all of him, no matter what that means. Does anyone have any advice of what I can do to either prove that I mean it when I say I’m here, or what to say to help him not be so terrified. As much as it breaks my heart, do you think I need to walk away? Which is absolutely not what I want to do, but if it’s what he needs should I suggest it? Will me even saying that make him feel worse?

Please help give me any and all advice on how I can help x thank you so much for reading",depression
"i don’t give a fuck about anything i have no direction in life. i don’t know what i want from life. everything just is what it is. i’m not sad or suicidal but i genuinely do not give a fuck where i end up in life. i don’t care about what happens. i don’t care about saving money. i don’t care about planning for the future. i don’t even care about living for today. i just go with whatever’s going on. i feel like a cold hearted bitch because i literally just don’t care. i don’t care about whatever anyone gossips about or complains about. i feel like i have no emotions anymore. i used to be a very reactive person who had an opinion about everything, but now i literally don’t even want to make an opinion about anything. the entire last year feels blended together and foggy. i feel like i lost who i am",depression
"There is no one who can help me I developed an extreme case of contamination OCD when I was around 14 years old. It started with repetitive hand-washing and over the years turned into a massive illness with multiple roots and branches that are all causing different kinds of torment

I started to be extremely lazy, depressed, and very suicidal. I turned from someone who was very good at school to someone who basically never attended and left with horrible grades. I left school around 4.5 years ago, and had to deal with two heartbreaks in this time, the last one specifically leaving me traumatized, full of fear and insane, long-lasting suffering. I had no way out of it, loving like a dog while being treated like a mutt and discarded, begging for the smallest attention while having to see, hear and experience extremely heartbreaking things which are so horrible to me that I can’t even mention them

My illness and suffering has left me scarred, often unable to comprehend my thoughts and emotions, and helpless even if help would be available. Doctors were never able to help me, instead they made me lose all my trust in them. I am extremely treatment resistant, not even strong medication like tranquilizers have an effect on me. I’m not even able to properly lay in my bed at this point, and not wanting to get out at all. I’m malnourished and haven’t left my apartment in months. I pray to God every day and it feels like I’m meant to suffer, that this is all my life will bring me

I know that I need help, urgently, and a lot of it, but I’m at a point where there is no motivation to talk to anyone, and I’m too scared and unable to reach out or ask for help. I know that people don’t care, and they won’t understand me. My girlfriend can’t do much for me either, my suffering makes her sad and unable to really help me, and sometimes I need to be quiet because the things I would say would hurt her and just cause problems. I only have her too, there is only one friend I have but we don’t talk

There is so much more I want to say, but I think I should end it here, thank you",depression
"Weird depression  i’ve made attempts, and have spoken with a variety of psychologists, therapists and the like. I believe I have a form of depression in which combatting would do no use. I see the world for how it truly is, how things work, how people work, and it fucking sickens me. I’m a happy person because i cherish the nuances of life but cannot help but to be dragged down to witness the true dystopia in which we’re living in. Every day passes and I feel the same. I have great aspirations and all the motivation to achieve them, however, I constantly witness inequalities and deplorable things happening every single fucking day that i just can’t seem to shake no matter what i try.

"Boredom is killing me  
I (19M) know the title of this post makes me sound like I'm being dramatic, but I'm serious, boredom is literally tearing me up inside. I do productive activities like drawing, writing, and going outside for a walk. But after I do those activities I feel so empty and drained to the point where I feel like nothing will cure my boredom.

I know some of you guys will tell me that I'm depressed, and that I should go to therapy/counseling (which I do), and I have no problem with that. But just know that I really mean what I say that I'm bored of just about nearly everything.

Every time I got outside for walks, I contemplate on how to get myself out of this painfully and seemingly endless loop of boredom. But it would seem like that going outside just to clear my mind and drawing and writing are the only options for me, for now at least.

I know all of what I'm saying is making me sound like I'm exaggerating, but I truly am bored. And I really want someone to talk to, but I don't want to be a burden to no one, so I might as well be a man and face my issues on my own. After all, I'm left with only by myself at the end of the day. I'm sorry for ranting, this is the end of it.",depression

I have so much to do, I have time to do it but I feel like I don't know where to begin, I'm like in a paralysis mode.

"i hate my job i feel miserable. i hate working. ive worked 3 different jobs so far, and ive hated every single one. i hate that i have to spend 8 hours, 5 days a week working. thats a third of each day locked away to working. and thats not even counting sleep. i dont get any sort of satisfcation from getting paid either. people say i should keep working anyway and just save up. but i dont want to. i really and truly am miserable. i come home after 8 hours, and spend the next 5-7 dreading the thought of waking up the next day. and then the weekend FINALLY rolls around, and i spend each day dreading the thought of work on monday. and the full 8 hours is me daydreaming of either quitting my job altogether and disappointing everyone, or just straight up killing myself. 

everyone keeps telling me that i need to aim for a job that pays well, regardless of how i feel working it, because at the end of the day i get to spend my money on what i want. money doesnt make me happy. i dont feel joy buying things. i want to aim for a job that will make me happy above paying me, but everytime i bring up the idea to anyone, im told to think twice about it, and then i go down a rabbithole of doubt. i also get told that work is just a way of life, and i genuinely cannot understand how anyone on this earth is able to just accept that. we have to trade away a third of our whole lives, just to scrape by for the rest?

"Side effects of Risperidone, better alternative?
 **My Current Medications and Sleep Struggles**

I’m currently taking the following medications:

* **Kredex (Carvedilol) 6.25 mg, twice a day**: A beta-blocker for heart-related issues.
* **Sipralexa (Escitalopram) 10 mg, once a day**: This is for managing **anxiety and depression**.
* **Risperdal (Risperidone) 1 mg, almost every eveing**: I’ve been using it primarily to help with sleep.
* **Lysanxia (Prazepam) 10 mg, as needed for anxiety**: A benzodiazepine I use for anxiety relief.

Personalia:

* 26 years old
* 1m76
* 70 kg
* male

I’ve noticed that I’m **really fatigued in the mornings**, and I believe this is due to **Risperidone**, which helps me sleep but leaves me feeling groggy and exhausted when I wake up. I also used to take **Zopiclone** for sleep, but my doctor stopped it because it was **addictive**.

Additionally, I **never feel full of energy** during the day, which is frustrating. I’m looking for a **non-addictive alternative** to help with my sleep problems.

"No solution but death I’m 22 and I know that’s young but hear me out, ever since I was young I had this dream life I wanted to have at least by the time I was in my early twenties. I know, sounds like the typical issue we all face but my dream life didn’t consist of ‘I have to be financially independent by this age’ or ‘I have to do this and that by this age’ it was never really about the action of doing or achieving something. It was more about what I would personally be like. I was certain my depression would have at least subsided enough to allow me to experience everything I’d missed out on in my teenage years because of said depression and other mental issues but no, it’s even worse now.

But that’s not what haunts me and drives me to suicide. What haunts me is that even if I were to get better right this second, I’m only getting older. I will never be 21 or 16 again or whatever. I will be getting older and older and I know that’s an uncontrollable part of life but it will be like I’m starting at 0 while everyone else is so far ahead. It’s not even about comparison, believe me. It’s just to put it into perspective that I’ve missed out on all those years and I will miss out on more trying to make up for it and making up for it won’t even work because see, there’s things I wanted in to experience at certain ages and now that those ages passed me and I didn’t get to experience them I will keep longing for them and even experiencing them at this age won’t make me happy because it won’t have meaning. And for that reason I don’t want to get better. I truly don’t want to because I know I won’t be happy. I just want an out so I don’t have to deal with any of it anymore.

"I won’t live past university  Hi Reddit. I’m coming here because I feel alone in the way I’m feeling and want to see if others relate. For context, I’m F18 and got into a life altering accident in the summer, which resulted in me having permanent damage on my face and some other parts of my body (I won’t be giving additional details to protect my privacy; just know it doesn’t impact my mobility but has affected my self esteem greatly) . Obviously my response to this was to fall into a pretty terrible depression. However now, the initial shock of it all is over, but the depression has yet to subside.   
  
in light of all this pain, as well as the realisation that I will have to live forever the way I am now, feeling constant heartache and grief over my pre-accident self; all the things I took for granted and which people around me still have; as well as insane regret over having put myself into a dangerous yet completely avoidable situation which led to the accident, i have realised that I will not be able to sustain this long term, and have resorted to finding a way to end it once university ends. 

i have chosen to stick it out for 3 years, despite each day consisting in me trying to bottle up my pain to live a semi normal life, and ignoring the questioning looks of people of why I look the way I do (as I said, my face sustained some shock in the accident, which has been the hardest to deal with. damn I miss finding myself pretty everyday), because despite it all, I DID use to be a person who wanted to live. However now, I think enjoying the small pockets of joy which life has to offer for 3 more years is enough; I think I’ll be satisfied with how much of the world I’ve experienced by then (if not earlier, as in end of my second year). 

I do however, grieve the idea of life that I had before all this. there is not so much which I am sad I won’t experience, but one of them is sadness at never having a baby of my own to love. I do think motherhood could save me in some ways, by focusing on someone else rather than myself, but I don’t see how I could have a kid rn in a sustainable way, being an 18 y old uni student and all, so I’ve just had to resign myself to never having that. 

I am in therapy and am medicated for this, which maybe helps making this all feel more tolerable, but it is just not enough. I dont want to spend the rest of my life simply tolerating how I feel, I wanted to spend it the way I did before all this, fully living, with joy and heartache.  It is useless to say that I will get better; because it won’t; there is permanent physical damage in my life that wont leave no matter how much therapy I have to help me get over it. 

It is genuinely relieving to know that I only have to feel this way for 2-3 more years, and I honestly can’t wait for the day to come where I am on my last day. But, it is lonely. Why are all my friends living the happiest times of their lives, with little problems other than school stress, whilst I cope with the aftermath of a stupid accident. there are definitely things I want to try before I die; smoking grass lol, having my first time, ok idk what else but I’m sure there’s more. So I guess I’ll find joy in trying to complete these things on a count down. im also just binging shows to distract myself, but this is defo having an impact on my schoolwork (which I don’t even take serious bc what’s the point if I’ll never even enter the workforce)…

  
okay I don’t think there’s a way to end this, I just wanted to vent my feelings for a little bit and not feel so so alone. Is anyone else thinking of ending it after uni, If so do you want to share how you are mentally preparing for that? or is anyone else dealing with physical issues which has caused depression? Idk just anyone who feels they can relate to any part of this, feel free to share if u wish

"I need help and Im only 15. (TW) 
I have been struggling with what i believe to be depression since i was atleast 10 years old. 

However, before i begin i would like to mention this is a really sensitive topic and situation for me to be talking about. So i would appreciate it if nobody tells me that “you cant have depression at 10 years old!!” or anything along those lines. 

I have always been so scared to talk to my parents about this because, even though both of my older siblings have struggled with similar issues, I just feel scared bringing this up with them. 
I must clarify though, that maybe i dont have depression but i do know that something is genuinely wrong with me and it runs along the lines of depression. 

2 nights ago, i attempted to overdose by taking 21 400mg ibuprofens. Obviously, this did nothing to me, And Ive never been one to act like this, But i just needed a big break from everything in life, Literally the noise, distractions, stress, and just overall pain. I need it all to stop.
The following morning, I just felt extremely nauseous. I cant even describe the pain i was feeling, it was almost comforting. 

Though, I suppose in the morning I just wasn’t completely awake when i made this decision, but i took 100mg of Vyvanse (An ADHD medication) and throughout the day i secretly took a little more, and more. 

I genuinely just think that I wanted an end not only to the pain, But to having no one ever take me seriously. I try to nonchalantly drop hints of me struggling to friends, teammates, teachers, etc. And everyone thinks im joking or just being dramatic.

If im being so honest. The majority of the time, Its not even that i necessarily want to die. I just need a break from the constant pain. I truly believe that I need actual help. - I dont know what to do.

I don't know how long I can take it working and doing this shit anymore. It's bulkshit after bullshit. And I'm trapped. Utterly trapped. I feel so angry and sad and anxious  all the time.

"Lost I feel so empty, like I’m just a husk of myself walking around pretending to be content. I’ve gotten to the point I barely feel anything and when I do it’s overwhelming. At first the only way I dealt with my feelings was pushing them down and away. When they come back I feel overwhelmed and try to shove them right back but they keep coming back more frequently. I don’t even recognize what these feelings are and I have the constant nagging thought of wanting to die. I can’t even go to bed without hoping I don’t wake up. My mind constantly wanders and the more I let myself think the more of a plan I start to form. I don’t know how much longer I’ll be around.",depression

"Is my life over at age 22? *small TW for mentions of abuse* I graduated college last May. My school was pretty prestigious and i graduated with a degree that opens a lot of doors in the industry i want. I’ve had several internships, jobs, and my resume is stacked. The only dent is my 3.1 GPA which apparently isn’t “good enough” for some jobs I’m really qualified for. I’m not trying to go into IB or work for Apple, and I’m competent enough. I haven’t found a job. I was extremely close in August but they dropped me last minute for no reason, and it was a job i was seriously looking forward to. I’ve had sparse interviews, I’ve lost motivation, and it’s made me depressed. I feel like I’m so behind my peers. Almost all of my friends live in a city out of state, and I’m trying to move there but i think jobs won’t want to pay relocation (my hometown is not far from this city and i could cover relocation) or take a chance on a recent grad. I’ve gotten insanely depressed about this. I’ve slowed down job applications, i feel hopeless, and I’ve started eating and moving around less. Showering is hard, the thought of cooking is a nightmare, and I keep ordering kpop albums with money I don’t have just so I can have something to look forward to in the next four days. I don’t know how long I can keep this up. I’m already far away from my friends as is, and I’ve gotten depressed to a point where I won’t even travel to see them or see any friends from home. I’m 22 and I know I have a while ahead of me. I just can’t seem to see a light at the end of the tunnel. It feels more like a cave where I’m just stuck in darkness. I’ve dealt with suicide attempts, verbal and sexual abuse, and insane breakdowns that left me unable to function, but this is breaking me. I feel so numb every day. I genuinely think that if I don’t find anything by new years I should give up and end it or take a job I hate in my hometown and live miserably to a point where I’ll want to end it. I’m considering paying for job services at this point, but with what money? And my friends don’t understand. I believe I’m pretty attractive, funny, and outgoing, but I am deeply hurting and I can’t stand the thought of letting someone in. My feelings are bottled up but not exploding, I’m just constantly checked out. I really don’t know what to do and I’m so depressed it’s making me sick. I’m aware others are dealing with more than I am and I feel stupid complaining about this but I can’t talk to an AI psychiatrist anymore and I needed a place to express my thoughts.",depression
"Feel numb, but also not I feel numb a lot, I don’t care about a lot of things anymore. I do feel anxiety, anger, and can laugh sometimes. Mostly I just have an apathetic view these days. Something to tell my psychiatrist I suppose.

Part of it is because I’ve been trying to count calories and lose weight lately and it’s a pain. My favorite thing is - well, was eating but now it feels restricted and all I can think about is eating something. I try to fill the void with water but in the end I always want more. Every serving size isn’t filling enough and it’s as if it’s for a toddler. 

Additionally, I have no goals or aspirations that I want to pursue. I want a quick way out but that isn’t feasible right now. I don’t want to try to kill myself if I have time to think about it and regret it. So many things I hate about this life.

"I have depression from my ability to get laid and have developed sexual shame Just to be clear im not asking for dating advice here. If you are allowed to under the rules of the subreddit you can contact me directly about that. I am here to ask about mental stuff. I hate being in the position I am. I feel like my youth has been wasted from not having sex at all. I am M21, only had sex a couple times with one person and It didn’t work out. Ive built this stigma that a large amount of people my age have a good amount of sex. Not anything crazy for the average person but I think the average could get laid maybe by like one to three different girls each school semester or something. I just feel like thats a large amount of people that get a good amount of sex and im missing out on it. But ill try not to get too off track but this shit is really eating away at me mentally. I feel like every day life isn’t valuable if I didn’t have sex recently. Also another factor is that, and when I say this im not trying to be egotistical, I am a pretty attractive man with a good haircut and frame at 6’4 and I think that causes an imbalance with my brain when im not able to attract a woman. I just can’t keep living like this, I need a relatively good amount sex for one thing (not trying to be a p¡g) and I need to get over these mental problems

"i cant forget the day i… i cant forget the day i had to clean my friend’s cuts that were recently done some minutes before. 
it was september 16, i was in physics class and received a text from my friend who had went to the bathroom earlier. He was delaying a little but i didn’t care that much cause we were teenagers who usually went to the bathroom to smoke or just to use our phones. 
The text clearly said “m/n can u please come to the bathroom?” which i responded that i would be there in a heartbeat and if was something wrong with him. He didn’t answer. 
I asked my teacher to go to the bathroom cause my friend wasn’t feeling very well, so the teacher told me to go and please tell him how was my friend doing. 
When i entered the bathroom i didn’t saw my friend, but i could hear someone crying so i screamed the name of my friend. The last door of the bathroom slightly opened while my friend came out of it. He was crying, his makeup was ruined and his arm was full of blood and paper towels which he had used to stop the bleeding. I was petrified. 
I told him to give me the thing that he used to cut his arms while i started crying cause i was in shock. By this time i was 12 and i haven’t seen that much blood before and i didn’t know how to act. 
I remember my mom saying to me that if a wound won’t stop bleeding i just need to add some pressure for a few minutes and then call an adult. 
When i controlled the bleeding, i went back to class, still with my red eyes and trying to concentrate again in my buisiness. 

As i couldn’t do that, i waited for the break which i used to go to my fav teacher and the one who i was having teacher attachment atm and told her everything. BIG MISTAKE

"I’m tired of being unattractive 

I’m exhausted from feeling unattractive. It seems so unfair. Why does everyone around me seem effortlessly beautiful, while I feel like I can never measure up? I don’t meet the standards, even within my own community. My skin’s too dark, my eyebrows are too thick, my face is too round—the list never ends. It feels like social media creates a new insecurity every day. I try to ignore it and keep scrolling, but I can’t stop comparing my face to every video I see. Every time I see a beautiful girl, I find myself raving about her beauty. I’m so tired of obsessing over my appearance. Sometimes, I want to smash every mirror in my house and delete all my social media. I’ve never struggled with these feelings as much as I do now, and it’s all-consuming. Seeing friends and people around me getting married makes it even harder. I’ve never been approached by a guy or even flirted with, and it makes me wonder if it’s all because of how I look. I just want to feel comfortable in my own skin, to love myself, and to feel worthy of being loved. But it seems like every day, I find something new to dislike about myself.

"It's all too much. Surrounded by pain. Surrounded by suffering. Surrounded by loneliness. Surrounded by hopelessnes. Surrounded by poverty. Surrounded by illness. Almost every facet of life deteriorates into bullshit. And the only reprieve is death. Agonizing, unimaginable pain, and then... Nothing.

I don't want to die, but having even a basic level of contentment seems to be a trillion miles away, and there exists no vehicles to assist in the journey and my legs are already at their limit and ache badly. Contentment or day I say ""happiness"" just seems like a fairy tale.

I just wish this pain would stop. I want to be able to laugh. I want to be able to sing and joke and dance, and hug and cuddle and love and kiss and fuck all without worry. I want to be able to watch the sunset again before being presented with a big beatiful star filled sky and actually being able to feel the joy it creates and I wish my fellow suffering brothers and sisters could partake as well.

But all this doesn't exist for many of us; it is but a total, bullshit fantasy pedeled upon us by those who don't truly have our best interests at heart. And even beyond that, the universe does not exist to pander to our needs. Without thousands of years of intense work adapting ourselves to the whims of the universe, we have no choice but to suffer. And we have found ourselves only partway through that process, if there is indeed an end at all. To make a heaven out of hell... Well... it seems unfathomable.

But that is all it is: a lie. Regardless I must stay alive and beg the universe to show me mercy, lest I end up succumbing to the urge of departing from my weak and frail meat prison.

We think he is on the autism spectrum but can’t afford a specialist to diagnose + our country has not very much supports. I’m still in college and working part time and he works casually (still about 30 hrs/week). We moved in together 2 years ago, and since then he’s seemed to be finding working more and more difficult. On days he has work he’s extremely grumpy and says that he can’t cope/wants to unalive himself at the thought of working. This has always been something he jokes about but in the last year he’s gone through some relationship trauma with his family and friends and now says that he doesn’t see himself ever being happy or satisfied living life in our society. He says life is not worth it. On days he does not work he is happy most of the time, but says that he wishes all he has to do is stay home and do his craft. We are both people who don’t like going out so this is fine, but then he gets stuck in his head saying money and a million dolars will solve all his problems. He even gets grumpy at me and argues when I say everything will be ok and he is too stressed, he just says life is too stressful for him. I don’t want to take it personally because I know he is suffering, but this makes me feel like our future plans and dreams isn’t worth working for. I’ve been carrying most of the household chores and supporting him as best as I can, but it never seems like enough. I know I can’t make him be happy, but sometimes it makes me sad that he is not excited for life like I am. How can I marry or have children with him if this is his views?

"I dont know how to deal with life I dont value having to work for things. I want to live in a world where- if I want something- I just instantly get it. No work, no struggle, no asking, no money, no developing skills, no earning it; I want to just get.

I cant eat the things I like because they make me fat. I dont want to eat healthy because theyre not the things I like. I cant spend my time how I like or I dont get enough exercise. I dont want to exercise because its hot and sweaty and requires effort. I cant simply starve myself or eat less because even being hungry is uncomfortable. Why cant I just...exist, and then be fine.

Everything I think, say, do, and feel effects other people; and vice versa. I cannot just be perfectly myself or other people either feel hurt or derride me. I share these feelings with friends and family, Im told its unrealistic or that I need to get over myseld. No comfort no sympathy. But if I object to something someone else says, they don't just agree once they realize I was right, it has to be an argument. Even the argument doesnt make them accept they were wrong. Goodness forbid its me whos wrong, then I get to either lie and feel like shit or admit it and lose standing and feel like shit. I like the trope idea of an unfeeling robot, theyd make a better friend and conversationist I think; at least when Im right.

I have to get up and work. I dont get to just eat, or socialize, or have a roof or power- even with all the bullshit stipulations above. No, I have to be useful. I have to contribute. If society does not actively materially benefit off my existence then I get to rot in the street? But do I get some kind of compensation other than the money to keep being sad? Some respect, celebration, fuck no. Everything matters except me. The people in power were born there, and deserve it by merit of already having it. Do I want it? Better fucking be pathalogically able to tolerate discomfort, because it basically requires living to work and then luck on top of it. And some stupid shmuck is willing to do it if I dont, and then they get to feel smug, everyone everywhere will think theyre better than me when I cant help any of the above.

And I know it sounds absurdly spoiled and fragile, but everything I just said actually legitimately causes me distress. I am unable to cope with basic reality. So long as I live in a world without star trek replicators surrounded by robots in an immortal perfect god body, I will be depressed. I will be sad and angry at everyone and everything.

"Don’t think I’m making it through Winter Hey all, I’m 27M. I’ve been considering the end of it all for the last year or so. Some of my friends know that I’ve been extremely unhappy with life the past… three years? Let me walk you through my thought process.

I’ve always been depressed and extremely anxious. I refuse help, I can’t bring myself to go to the doctors or see a therapist. It’s just not an option for me. I’ve always had to be the support system for my friends and family, I can keep faking it that way. I ruin any opportunity for a relationship that comes my way because I overthink then just hide away. I can barely bring myself to go outside most days.

I live in a small town, I have the same friends that I’ve had since I was 14. We do the same things we’ve always done, but it’s not something I enjoy. I have to pretend to enjoy it still, so they have some reason to keep inviting me over. They all have families, kids, their own houses. They’re doing amazing. I’m so happy for them. I’m just stagnant. I make good enough money to have what they have, but, I’m terrified of letting people in, giving anyone a chance.

It’s not like I’m incapable of it, I’ve had a few relationships, but, I do always end up self sabotaging them in one way or another. It’s just not for me.

I have no drive, no wants, no needs. I get up, work, hang out with friends or just rot in my room. I can’t really keep doing it anymore. I feel like I’ve lived life as much as I want to. There’s nothing for me to prove, nothing for me to go home to. I don’t have pets, nobody relies on me, all my bills and loans are paid off, I’m just… tired of it all. 

I want to go back to when I was happy, looked forward to the day. When I wasn’t so anxious I make myself sick half the week. When I had dreams, had wants, when I wanted to travel. But, fuck man. Life just isn’t like that. And no matter what I’ve done, I can’t find a way to replicate it.

"I just hate my Life I know my life is not as sad as many others. I've been trying to live my life with fun, happiness, and peace. But as of recent my life has gone so downhill. I'm only 16 and part of me wishes I could just turn back time, my parents at this point in time rather care about my grades rather than how I feel.

A Majority of my grades are good, with A's and B's and only 1 C. But for my math class I have an F, even though my teacher will always bump it up to a D every 5 weeks, (So I don't take summer school) it has just kept stressing me out. When my parents found out that my Math was in an F grade, I tried explaining to my parents that I've been struggling. Yet my parents always deem it as being lazy or not asking for help. Soon after they wanted me to drop off my extracurricular activities. One of them being Acapella. I was so sad because my life was already filled with stress. My grades, my relationship, my family slowly giving me less privacy. It was horrible, yet Acapella was like a gateway to relieve my stress and forget all about it. Yet even to this day I'm still stressed. My parents were always stingy about my future, even putting me in homeschooling because I was ""doing horrible in school, and my friends were distractions"". My parents even want me to be part of a medical field when I grow up rather than letting me choose for my own future. I was even called into the school's therapy office, because I was found talking about suicidal thoughts. And now I don't know what to do. As of the time I'm writing this, I'm planning on going to school therapy since venting to strangers online might not work.",depression
vent i just hate how life is so confusing and stressful. i just want to be able to lay in bed all day and not do anything but i have to do things or else my family will be mad most likely. and why is it that evry time i make a small mistake or sometring people always non verbally say “you are a terrible person” i dont get it?? why does everyone looks at me like im the scum of the earth. i have all these thoughts circulatikng in my head almost all the time but i have to shut them out for the day so i seem normal to others but the fact is that even if i do say that im stuggling my family (my dad particularly) just shrugs it off?  it always annoys me but somehow i just cannot fix this problem,depression

"I'm at the lowest I've ever been, And I'm scared I'm going to die I've been living with two family members and long story short we're all being evicted due to their out of control behaviour because of their mental illnesses,One of them went into a facility and the other is taking out all her anger on me and saying she hates me and hopes i suffer and that shes going to hurt herself in front of me, I realize that I said things to both of them I should've never said but for the past 3 years they've done nothing but emotionally and mentally manipulate me into believing I am worthless and that anything they do is my fault, I was never able to leave because I am mentally ill and disabled as well, I only just recently got my first job and I'm already scared I'm not doing good enough, But disability said I wasn't disabled enough to qualify so I can't get that and I don't even think it'd be enough for me to live on anyway. I'm sitting here freaking out trying to figure out how to find a place for me and my dog because I can't be homeless when I need to take care of her, And I don't want to give her up because right now she's the only reason I want to stay alive. I have nowhere else to go and I just started my first job, I don't know when I'm getting my paycheck or if it'll even be enough to help me get my own place,All I know is that I'm tired of living live constantly being afraid or being emotionally manipulated by people I thought I could trust, I understand that I've made bad choices in my life and I take full accountability for the choices that screwed myself over, But I'm tired of having to pay the price for what others have done to wrong me. I am not a perfect person and I know that I will never be perfect or good enough to anyone, I just want to be good enough to take care of myself and my dog and live a normal life without having to justify my self worth to other people when I didn't even want to stay alive in the first place, I was just too scared to end my life as a kid because I thought there was a chance I could live a normal life, But I was wrong. I don't know how much time I'll have to find a place whenever the eviction letter gets here, I just know that I'm ripping my hair out worrying about it because there's nothing I can do, I'm angry at them for wronging me but I'm more angry at myself for letting myself get trapped in this mess. I know that this post probably won't make a difference to anyone or fix my situation, But I'm tired of having to scream just so I can be heard because nobody ever listens to me no matter how hard I try, I've done the best I can to get over the past and live but I can't when this insanity just keeps happening over and over again, I just wanted to be normal, I just wanted to live, And I failed.",depression
"I can't do this but I can't not do it either I'm 17, I've been depressed my entire life. I'm turning 18 later this month and it has filled me with much dread. I can't take care of myself or do much of anything. I dropped out of school in freshman year and I never go outside. I have no friends in person, and I had no friends when I was attending school either. I am autistic, transgender, fat, and ugly. Four things that have no place in this world, no place to thrive and be happy anyway. I haven't felt real joy in a long time. It's gotten to the point where I dread feeling any moment of happiness because I know it's going to end so quickly and I'll start feeling empty again, wishing I had never felt happy in the first place because it's more painful for the joy to be taken away over and over than for it to not be there at all.   
  
I've never had a job, and I can't work because I can't bring myself to leave my house. I occasionally leave maybe once a month to go to the grocery store with my mother or to visit my sister and that's it. I live in a trailer and am underneath the poverty threshold. There is black mold everywhere in the bathroom and it's been making me sick, my eyes always sting and my face always burns. We even have rats. We can't use the oven because when you turn it on, I suppose the ammonia from the rat-piss behind it ignites and the stench is so strong you can't breathe.   
  
I've opened up about my situation to online friends in the past but it seems it always ends up as just something for them to use against me and make fun of me for in the future whenever I piss them off. I know my mother is trying but I don't think she realizes just how bad our situation is. She spends so much money on weed and alcohol that by the end of the month our water or electric is always getting cut off. It's been this way for some years now. She passively aggressively suggests I get a job constantly and she doesn't understand that I want to more than anything, but I physically can't. I can't even bring myself to shower or change my clothes most of the time.   
  
People will try to tell me that I'm not a burden but I genuinely am; I contribute nothing to this world and only leech off of others. I regret my parents for having brought me into this world, I wish so so desperately that I had never been born at all. It's painful knowing that I'm stuck here until I die. Death is terrifying for me and has brought me nothing more than existential dread since the age of 6. I don't want to die but I can't exist either, not like this. Not existing or not having been born is all I think about all day.  
  
 I can slowly feel myself entering a state of psychosis. My thoughts grow more erratic and extreme with each passing day, and will continue to do so until eventually I can't recognize them as abnormal anymore. I am slowly becoming delusional. I only fear what I will do when I finally reach this state of detachment from reality. I have a girlfriend who I've been dating online since 2020 and we were planning to meet sometime after I turn 18 (only because I am supposedly supposed to have more 'freedom' when I am an adult, but that doesn't change the fact that I cannot drive, have no money nor a job).  
  
 I love her with all my heart but I fear me loving her isn't enough for me to want to stay here, to want to live. I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried medication and therapy, but it eventually all turns out to be pointless. When I get a therapist once every couple of years, it eventually ends by me not being able to make my appointments because my mom works and I don't have a car. There's so many problems I have that I can't even begin to list here because it would make the post too lengthy, and then nobody would read it. I don't even know if anyone is reading this one. I don't know what to do anymore, I don't know what to do anymore and I fear what I'm capable of when I finally lose it, if I am capable of anything at all.",depression

This all started with a bad day when I was five, and since then, I haven't had a good day. I have learned to force a smile and make it seem real. I can fake a laugh so well people think they like it. I can do anything except for be honest, and cry. I don't cry, almost ever. And nobody around me sees me as worth anything. I'm just there, quiet, and on the side. I can't think of a single emotion that I haven't had to suppress. I'm like a walking lie, a smile, a laugh, a living body, an unharmed body. No matter what it is, everyone around me pushes my problems to the side. I hide everything behind a smile, behind this god awful mask. I can't even say when I'm not comfortable. My girlfriend is needy and pushy and childish, and I can't tell her that, because otherwise she'll get mad at me. My best friend gave up on me and didn't even tell me when his fucking grandmother died, when he told everyone else. My friends all demand so much out of me and can't be bothered to care when I have nothing left to give. I am a worthless, useless, horrible person who can't even be genuine.

"Will I go back to my caged life because am stupid ?  25 yo female, I had a “break” between my bachelors and my masters of 4 years, I made sure that I worked to collect enough money to study abroad in hopes to run away from my shit country where I couldn’t express my self freely (spoiler alert it’s somewhere in the Middle East) since I was a kid my dream was just to move somewhere where I can be myself fully. I met a man online and fell in love with the most amazing man in the universe who lives in Europe and gotten into a 5 years LDR where we only met 4 times in total for about 25-30 days each vacation, the more I meet/talk to him the more I fell in love. And he made me more excited to accomplish my dream of moving abroad so I was able to collect the money to fully support myself but in order for me to move to that European country I need a job and in order to get a job I need to be “in level” with the locals and rightfully so. So I decided ok I will peruse masters it was eventually one of my dreams to continue my studies so why not I did amazing and got honors in my BSc why wouldn’t it work for masters I can do well I thought to my self, since I was always really good at studying and perfected my job also. And I got it, a really prestigious university cuz I thought if I wanna be in level I gotta graduate with the best from the best uni and I got in and was the happiest girl ever, I got my student visa and moved since July and both my bf and I are renting the cutest apartment ever and living very happily together and everyday we wake up/sleep and eat next to each other even study! And am like damn this is so amazing this is the happiest I have ever been in my entire life. Studies start it is becoming more and more difficult with studies only but I am able to understand yet sadly I taken my first exam last week and I kid you not my confidence has been completely shattered I feel like shit and feel like a failure I don’t think I will succeed at all I fucked up my life is ruined is All I can think of every night before I sleep, I am wasting my money that I been collected cuz am failing in this course (we can retake exams but the point is never felt like this in my life, and if I retake I might also disturb other courses and fuck them up) I know am not alone many other students felt like they failed and they seem to be smarter than me ngl but I am shattered internally, the grades have not been publish yet it takes 25 days but I already know the results and that is making me feel depressed and anxious and stressed and all the shit feelings on earth. And all I can think of is if I fuck up my first exam ever in uni then am fucking up all the other ones too cuz this one is meant to be the easy level. And if I also keep fucking up that means I can’t get my masters and if I can’t get my masters it means that I can’t get a job once I graduate and if I can’t get a job that means I have to go back to my depressing country which alternatively means I can not be with the man that I love…. 

All this is just on my mind constantly and I can’t stop thinking about it, am not sleeping properly at all, today I slept only 2 hours and am going to class and I have deadlines and shit to do, I just feel so down and feel like I failed my self and my partner he has been nothing but supportive and reassuring but I already feel like am not gonna do well cuz I have no options, except for masters > job > happy but now I know that non of this will happen cuz am stupid and am fucking up everything. 

What also sucks is that every time am on my own and thinking obsessively about this I start crying or tearing up and that makes me get a stuffed nose and the en a migraine so it just makes it worse and worse.

Yeah that’s all I have I just need to write all of this down and rant to strangers cuz I don’t have the heart to bother or wake up my sweet man and scare him for crying at 4 am he is already having disturbed sleep from me I don’t want to bother him with that more.

"homesick and depressed TW: drugs, depression, suicide, suicidal thoughts, death, substance abuse, alcohol, etc.

hello,

my depression fades in and out, a lot of days I can be really depressed, cold (physically), sweating or anxious. Then the next day my body acts like none of that happened. I wake up feeling really cold, but I sweat. The cold sweat every night, not being able to sleep, not being able to stop overthinking, it takes a real toll on me.

I've attempted suicide before. I will say that's not how I currently feel. Though, if I were to die, I wouldn't feel any type of way about it. I would want to accept it, because at this point it's more of a solution than an issue in my life. I'm behind on work, behind on rent, behind on other bills such as water and electricity.

On top of that I got suspended from work for a month and a half for some bullshit, like missing a single deadline for a document that wasn't even important. I did everything else right, every meeting, every document, project, but no this world wants to focus on the worst always.

I've been cheated on by every girl I dated, 5 girls out of 5. That's why I stopped dating and went to therapy, and I asked my therapist to help me build a healthier relationship with myself and others. He tried to help, but even he said I seem like a good person and that them cheating was their fault and not mine. But how can I even believe that when I'm the one being cheated on every time? and no i wont cheat back or anything because I have morals.

So I tried to have ""single fun"", online, irl, and i was successful. It was actually easier than I thought it would be, but maybe it was a fluke because after a fling, i had nothing. To be fair, I stayed inside my apartment alone, smoking weed or cigarettes until i would pass out or numb myself. I missed home everyday (living with my parents), I'm only 21. Life isn't supposed to kick me so hard from every direction all of my life. I see others who struggle less than me, and I don't really envy them until they judge me.

For example, I had one of my childhood friends visit me at my place. He saw it was messy and that I was ashamed, but he tried to joke about it being dirty and stuff. He asked me why I just smoked weed all day and nothing else, and I told him how depressed I was. I don't think he understood, because he tried to offer me other solutions like go to the gym. My problem wasnt gym related, I have a very well maintained, athletic figure, I'm fit with good stamina and I stay relatively active despite not going to the gym.

whenever people try to offer ""help"" why is it always advice and not something more concrete? for example, if my friends told me they were depressed, I'd ask them how I could help, instead of assuming their problem was gym.

Well anyway, I'm with my parents right now which is why I'm not suicidal I guess. I felt very good when I was here, safe and comfortable. But now I have to go back to my place (2 hours via flight or 8 hours via land), and I won't see my family for at least a few more weeks.

I know my problems may sound small to some, but to me nothing feels more important right now than staying here in my hometown with my family. I hate that I have to go back to such a stranded place where I'm lucky to see a person on the street.

Honestly, I've quit alcohol. I didnt touch it at all this year and that was big progress, because I was an alcoholic. I also tried to quit thc and I made some progress (2 months) but i relapsed. it feels like such an unnecessary battle now, why am i even fighting it?

I was grateful for the opportunity. I struggled to get accustomed to the environment. My grades during the first semester weren't great, but I didn't want to give up. By spring of 2020, I felt so much more comfortable about my experience. I was even excited to study abroad. 

Then the pandemic happened. 

I was forced to go home, and all of the coping mechanisms I had couldn't be used anymore. I slept for weeks; my math teacher started to ask where I was. I couldn't comprehend what it meant to keep going even though the world was on fire. Eventually I faked my way through the rest of the semester. I fell out with my mom, the only person I was living with at the time, and I moved in with my grandparents. 

Fast forward a few years and I graduated. I moved to a new city for work. I'm a part of a program, but they haven't held up there end of the bargain of providing me with a full time role. I live in fear every day of losing my job, and my mom and others around think I was stupid for taking it. I'm exhausted. I try to fight it, but I'm haunted by the decisions I've made. I'm worried that I'll deteriorate before I find out what comes next. I don't know what to do. ",depression
I can’t look at myself  Does anyone else end up crying or angry or anything negative when they look at themselves in the mirror? Sometimes I get to a point where even a glimpse of myself makes me cry. ,depression
"I don’t have money and everyone hates me Getting slammed in r/sitcoms. Decided to just agree with everyone. I don’t even have money for medication for my depression because my Dad spent all my money on tires for his car and I paid the mortgage. But I yelled at him a year ago for watching a TV show with a rapist in it around me. I hate myself. I hate everyone. I self harm by hitting myself on the head because I deserve it. I feel useless at work, at home. I hate my family because they won’t even help me with money for meds. I wish I had the guts to just die.",depression
"I just feel empty and lost. I’m currently 24 and I turn 25 on Dec. 2nd. I am also a black male. As my birthday approaches I realize how lonely I am, I have never been in a relationship, I have no friends even on this app, and my family don’t understand my feelings. There are days I work at my job and think to myself why can’t I have something better? I workout and think why don’t I have a gym partner? Then when I’m alone at home I think why am I so lonely? There are days I try to not think about it but it always crawls its way back to my head. Personally I feel like I never win in a way like I’m always destined to lose no matter what. Some days I feel like a freak for being different to other guys in my race. I just don’t kno what to do next in my life.

"Poor dental hygiene, how can I explain to my dentist tomorrow  So I think I have depression, anxiety and ADHD, not certains not diagnosed but I’m on 150mg sertraline now lol, also my mum thinks I have ME/CFS bc I have a lot of the same issue she does and that’s what she has (all this is just background) 

So, probably been asked thousands of times and probably very relatable BUT, I have got to go to the dentists tomorrow for a checkup and of courseeeee I’m terrible with dental hygiene. I’m not diagnosed ADHD, I saw my GP and she got my to do a self assessment checklist and she said my results indicate I could have adhd and she sent it to some people and has just said that “they’ll contact you” so idk if that’s a waitlist or what. I also have been on antidepressant for months now keep going up basically for anxiety and depression, again not diagnosed and she just said a therapist might diagnose me we just need to keep on the path we’re at lol. 

Anyway so I just wake up and don’t think about brushing my teeth, I’m awake till I’m exhausted so I then just flop into bed and rot until I sleep, I’m ashamed to say I can go weeks without brushing properly and flossing, my dentist has told me off before and I said I’d do better and I do for a week but then it continues. Last time I saw her was before I spoke to the GP and started all this. 

SO my two questions are 1- what can I do to make my teeth look as best as they can before tomorrow lol, and 2- how can I explain why I’m so bad at dental hygiene properly idk I hate being told off I feel ashamed, my mums also going for her checkup and maybe I’ll get her to explain it but I’m literally 20 yrs old I should be able to do better :/",depression

"Should I try nortriptyline or desipramine? I did a gene test and these 2 are the only two TCA’s in the green category - all the others say I am an ultrarapid metabolizer. I have been taking clomipramine in spite of this, but it’s caused me to gain 30 pounds, so I am looking to switch to something else. I have comorbid ocd and adhd as well. It has to be a TCA because snri’s aren’t strong enough for me - I am taking pristiq but have to be taking a second antidepressant with it. Between nortriptyline and desipramine, which would be least likely to cause weight gain? I don’t know if one or the other would be better for ADHD symptoms either, as those are what I’m dealing with most. (I do also take Qelbree for that but it’s not enough on its own). I asked my psychiatrist what he thinks and he didn’t really have an opinion, so I suppose it’s up to me which one I decide to try first. ",depression

It was documented until I was 10 (after I tried to end it) and well have been faking it till I make ever since. I’ve accepted that my role in life is to help others with there issues, to mine aside and just ensure that everyone else is happy. It’s not my job, I know, but the moment I speak up - I get told I’m making myself the victim. I’ve come to accept that I’ll just be happy when I’m dead.

"Guilt I’ve struggled with what I’m guessing is depression for around four years now. I haven’t seen an expert yet but I have booked to see one later this month. Everyday I feel like my mind tells me I’m not worth the trouble and no doctor will care. I’m just a miserable dude who hurts himself and longs to leave this plane. I want to feel at peace again so badly. My head feels like it’s in a constant battle against itself and it’s so draining. It’s not like I’m going to kill someone or pose a threat to society so why should doctors care? I feel like my illness is not valid and I’m just putting all these thoughts in my head on purpose. I know something isn’t right with me but I just feel guilty for being like this when I live a pretty decent life. I don’t know if it’s the illness telling me that my struggles aren’t real or it’s just me. I hope this makes sense for some people here. 

Also I’d love to make some new friends, so feel free to talk to me about whatever. It’d be nice to communicate with people who feel the same way. ",depression

"pls can someone lmk if im depressed or anxiety or this is all just in my head hi, i'm 19yo female in second year of college. early last summer my blood test results showed me that my thyroid levels are unusually high. around early October i started feeling terrible and my feelings significantly worsened after mid October. i have tried reaching an endocrinologist since but none are available till 2025.

i am going to list my symptoms below. not expecting anything close to a doctors response but i would appreciate it if someone could read thru them and lmk if it's just related to thyroid or im depressed separately. it's driving me crazy

\- constant feeling of dread and that life is not going to get better and im just stuck in an endless space (im going to greece next semester i should feel great but instead i just feel numb and blank and terrible)

\- randomly crying for no reason . Lol once in class i inexplicably started feeling awful and cried a little it was so emb. other times when im alone ill start heaving and having a whole crying session that lasts ages

\- feeling alone / that i have no real friends / no one to confide to

\- heavy heart

\- sometimes ill wake up feeling fine . this is gonna sound weird but those mornings ill miss how i felt depressed and want to go back to it because I've become so used to it

\- feeling useless and undeserving of my quality of life

\- feeling unlovable

\- i can get distracted from all this when i hang out w people but as soon as im alone again it comes back. like a pit in my chest

\- feeling lazy and tired

\- harder for me to concentrate on work and lock in

\- hyperfixated on what i eat and eating ""healthy""

\- attaching all my self worth to my physical appearance, especially my body (but face too)

BUT... i have never ever thought of ending my life. in fact i have always been afraid of death and that has not changed and i don't think it ever will.

All of the above is for NO REASON btw. nothing is wrong in my life, i take easy af classes, there's literally no reason i should be feeling any of this but i just do. which is more frustrating bc in some ways itd be easier if i could just trace this back to a reason

never thought id take meds for mental health and i still don't think i will. i don't think its bad enough yet i don't think it's bad enough until im like...yk wanna end stuff. but im open to opposing thoughts 

i cant think of more but for now these are what i got. i hate this and i would appreciate any insight thank u sm",depression

Now this shouldn't make a boy depressed or saying to himself that ""I should fucking kill myself"" and get into a downward spiral over something as trivial as that but it did and it just set the mood for the whole day. Everything I do wrong just reflects back to me of how shitty and ineffective of a person I am.

"How long do I have to deal with this? I’m so exhausted. It’s been four fucking years. 

I’ve done therapy (with several therapists). I’ve tried tons of medications. I’ve done groups. I did an outpatient program TWICE. I’ve been inpatient.

I’m 23yo, have a really good job, and I’m just as bad, if not worse, than I was when this all started to fall apart.

I genuinely don’t know how to enjoy life anymore. I do fun things with friends occasionally, but even that is a ghost of what it should be. 

It’s also fucked me over with work. I’m not the kind of person who can still clock in, even if they’re a shell of themselves. I can’t even turn my damn work computer on work from home days, much less make it into the office when I need to. 

This is my first full time job and I feel like I’m on the edge of being fired. My manager sends me an email once a week about how poor my attendance is. It’s so much worse because I’m a genuinely competent employee when I’m doing well. My coworkers tell me all the time that I’ve picked things up much faster than anyone could expect from me. Hell, if I wasn’t depressed I’d be a fucking star employee. I was a star student before the depression hit. 

They’re doing layoffs next week too, which won’t help, and I don’t know what the fuck I’m gonna do if I have to find a new job. I don’t think I can make myself do it, but I live 1000 miles from my family. 

I genuinely don’t know what else to do. It’s possible I have treatment resistant depression, but all the treatments for that scare the shit out of me. Is there anything else I’m just not trying?

People who’ve actually gotten better, if it took you more than a year, how long did it take? How did you survive it?

Have any of y’all had to spend some time being unemployed so you could recover? If so, how long were you off? What did you do to heal? How did you afford daily expenses? How hard was it to get a job again after, especially if you got fired?",depression

"Self realization I've gotten to the point where I don't really feel lonely or like nobody cares but I just realized how much of a toxic misanthrope I actually am. I feel like anybody who I am close to is bound to be hurt because I'm so emotionally defective. My social battery just randomly shuts off and every person ever begins bothering me. I feel like I just hurt those around me. I only feel normal when I'm alone with my thoughts or drunk.

I used to dream of having someone super close to be intimate and open with, mostly a girlfriend. But the reality is anybody who'd be there for me would just end up burned in the end. It's weird because I still constantly think about being held and pitied and showed unconditional affection even for a moment.

Beyond that I just don't feel motivated to do anything. It all feels like a distraction. Even when I try I end up disappointed in myself.

Honestly I feel alienated from family and at an arms length from everyone else who I call close. I just wish I could get worse so that I could stop having to tolerate myself during every waking moment of my life. ",depression

I’m stuck in a job I hate, and after spending two years trying to break into the entertainment industry, I feel like I’ve just wasted time. I’ve lost all motivation to take care of myself. Even basic tasks—getting groceries, cleaning my apartment—feel overwhelming. What’s scary is that only six months ago, I was a happy, upbeat person, but that spark feels completely gone.

On top of that, I’m the only single person in my friend group, which leaves me feeling alone. Trying to date just adds to the frustration; it’s the same story every time—no one wants to commit. It makes me wonder, what’s the point of all this? I’ve been having dark thoughts lately, questioning if I’m even cut out for life the way others seem to be.

feeling a bit suicidal recently ive been feeling suicidal. For a month ive been depressed and there are times where i dont want to even go to school.

"Struggling a month into a new job I began a new job a month ago and ive had big ups and downs throughout the entire time. Currently, I feel like shit and its hurting me to go every day, even though I have to.

I work at an insurance company and I am afraid that I am a disappointment and I’m going to get fired. I can’t stop bringing myself down about this and I am unsure if I am overthinking.

The work I do is pretty complex, with very different ways of doing things for each task that really require you to know specific information to understand it. Most of the time I feel like I am on my own trying to figure things out. 

My supervisor is responsible for me and is there in person only 3 times a week, working 2 days remotely. Its very difficult to get a hold of her because she is so busy while also yapping about her personal life to co workers on zoom calls. When I am able to get her to show me something, its for about 30 minutes to an hour.

I am a temporary employee in this position, and the only good thing ive heard so far about my performance is that my supervisors boss encouraged me to apply for a full time position that opened up, and that they are happy with the work I’ve done. Its been a week and I haven’t heard anything about it again.

My co workers also dont seem open at all to helping me, and when I do ask for help in the most respectful way I can, they seem slightly irritated like I am interuppting them but what else can I do? No matter when I try it is always that way.. also there is only four people in the office max at a time so we are severely understaffed.

I feel like an idiot asking for help all the time, like I am behind and just not understanding things like I should. I dont want it to seem like im lazy or just not trying to understand, because I truly am trying my best. 

At one point I heard a co worker kind of talking shit about me complaining that they are on the service counter that day, and that I am still listed as “other” on the schedule. Like wtf am I supposed to do im not knowledgable enough to do that yet!

My boss seemed slightly agitated today because I was asking so many questions and it really upset me. I just really dont want to mess up because with the work I do it is important to be accurate. I am afraid I am going to get fired and all of this was for nothing. I am afraid that I am messing up on the work I do, but I feel like an idiot saying that to them and that it’ll make me look even worse.

"I was molested as a child  I was molested when I was younger 

TRIGGER WARNING
Also this might be a long read sorry in advance. 
I (20)m was molested by my grandfather and raped by my sister when I was around the age of 6. We grew up in a poor household. My grandparents had custody of me since my mom was with her boyfriend and my dad was in jail at the time. I don’t want to go into detail because I don’t want to think about it but my grandfather was a mean and horrible old man. He was definitely a psychopath. He physically abused me and my sisters mentally, physically and sexually at least for me. Then after my grandfather did what he did to me my sister raped me 3 times or at least that’s the amount of times I remember. I didn’t tell anyone and still haven’t I’m far to embarrassed by it. The only comfort that I can take from this is that my grandfathers dead and my sister is in Prison now for an unrelated reason. I think the whole situation has fucked me up really badly because I’m shaking writing this rigt now. I can’t form relationships or talk to people without feeling uncomfortable. It’s not that I don’t like people I guess I’m afraid of others. I have female friends but never had a real relationship before. I’d like to go to therapy one day either that or I kill my self.

"obsession at some point in a relationship i get to the point where i think i would do anything for them. Im not sure if thats good or bad.

"I dont belong here... I dont really belong anywhere, really. I ended up with attatchments, which have kept me here this long: wife, kids, grandson. But I dont deserve them, and they deserve better than me. I cant change the world, or even myself. I get good moods, but eventually always end up with the gun. I'm too hard on myself, thanx to overbearing rapist step daddy, and I am never satisfied with my output on the job. It can always be better, and since there's room for improvement: I did'nt do the job right. I make friends easily because I always look for the good in people. But I end up forgetting they all have bad as well. And usually more bad. The world does'nt know right from wrong anymore, and it confuses me. The world cares about appearance, but not substance. September is Suicide Awareness Month... Great. How many fucking lives did that save? How many people started going out of thier way to notice others? None. The world walks by whats wrong with blinders on. And the only was to assimilate is to become like them. And so I have. I needed to become the good man that does nothing to oppose bad men. And that makes me one. 

I might try doubling all my meds first. Maybe that'll numb me enough. But if not: I'm either going with the rope or helium bag. Depends on how I want to be found I guess. Not that I care overmuch. But it would be nice if my grandson does'nt find the body. But he'll have to harden up to reality at some point. 

 I'm not giving shit away. These vultures can fight over my kingdom of shit. I'm not leaving a note: if ya paid attention you would've seen it coming. I'm not asking friends for help because I'm not even sure if they really are friends and that's too risky. If I had'nt just gotten fired on my birthday (Turns out you need to be a racist if you work for racists. That's the one thing I do right: all races should have the right to suffer equally...) I would'nt share because that's how you lose a job. I wont be calling 988 because they might just call the cops and I do not wish to be shot to death: it's not guaranteed enough. I'm not even asking for help here: Y'all dont know me. I'm just another NPC you have no reason to care about. It's fine. I just wanted to say this without being interupted. Sorry if this fucks with anyones day, but remember: you dont know me. Aint no blood from your vein.

"Scared feeling of going crazy Hi, I’m 18(m) and I just created this account to post this. I haven’t attended school since summer. And I’m scared of going crazy/insane. When I leave the house, I get a lot of unwanted thoughts. When I bike to school I get constant extremely weird thoughts. For example, what if I crashed into that car over there? Or: what if I just killed myself right now? I’m scared, I don’t want to think about these things at all. 

The further I am from home, my safe space (bed) I get extremely anxious when I focus on the fact I’m not home. I’m scared of not being able to move my way back home (my limbs literally not wanting to move) over the last year, when I think about moving my body. I just feel weird about it. Like, how do I move? How am I able to move? That gets me all weird and scared i that won’t be able to move anymore. Like my brain just can’t do it anymore.

Whenever I see someone kill themselves on the news I get scared. What if I become like that one day? What if I lose control one day and do something weird? 

Other than that, the thoughts can also intensify at school, or when I’m with someone. Like, what if I punch this person right now or what if I just pull my pants down? My thoughts are always there and it’s hard to avoid. I’m hopeless, and don’t know what to do. I don’t wanna feel like this, I just want to live a normal life not rotting in bed all day. However, when I’m gaming or doing something intensive, my attention drifts away and I don’t think about it. 
Also, weirdly enough, whenever I feel uncomfortable, I get the urge to touch myself. Idk why this is.

These annoying thoughts, combined with panic attacks, make it really difficult for me to function normally in this society. It’s stopping me from getting a job, or even attending school.

Is there anything I can do? Am I going crazy?",depression
"I want to kill myself  Lately, I’ve lost nearly all of the people that I’ve loved and cared about. It’s not that they have died or anything, most of them just something they thought were more important to them than me. I just feel like I’m a fucking bandage that just gets thrown away after healing someone and now I’m still together with a girl i promised to myself would be the last person i would ever try to hold a relationship with or try to ever open up to. Now she’s saying that she still has feelings for her ex and is debating if she should go back to him or not. Mind you this is while we are together and I’m just scared of losing her because i have attachment issues, due to how i have always been the second choice, the person you only talk to when you don’t have anyone else and the person that gets abandoned. I’m convinced that if she leaves I’m going to kill myself, she was the only reason that i have been alive this long and if she leaves i loose that purpose.",depression
"Success stories from switching antidepressants? Going from SSRI to SNRI? I (30F) have tried a few different medications over the years. I'd say anxiety is the main issue, but that combined with social isolation has definitely driven me into a depression. I was on Celexa in college but truthfully didn't really feel anything on it. Plus my situation changed and I felt comfortable getting off of it. I've had depressive episodes over the years that came and went, but I never prioritized medication again. Last year I was going through an incredibly rough time deciding to end a relationship (lost interest in most things, wasn't sleeping, threw up often from anxiety) and decided to get on Lexapro. The first few weeks were awful getting adjusted, but once I got over the hump I'm honestly not sure if it was really helping me. Again, I deprioritized it and eventually weaned off of it once my situation started looking up (mostly having things planned with friends and ending that period of social isolation).

All that said, this year has been the most trying so far. I try to put myself out there and meet people, make plans with friends, focus on my career/hobbies, etc. but it feels like they're all just distractions from a deep discomfort within myself. My friendships/connections feel superficial. I work remotely and spend most of my time alone. Dating has been draining and disheartening. The second I slow down, it all hits me. The fatigue, the loss of appetite, the constant nausea, the insomnia, the lack of interest in doing *anything*... I knew I needed to address the underlying fears driving my anxiety and driving me into depression, but I knew medication was a first step and that I really needed to make it a priority this time, not just hop on and off whenever my situation changed. It's clear that  I need to work on my ability to cope and function regardless of my situation.

I started Pristiq a few days back and the side effects I had on Lexapro came screaming back to me... the insomnia, the horrible nausea/vomiting, the jitters, the worsening depression/anxiety as I get acclimated, etc. I don't have any experience with SNRI's as opposed to SSRI's but I'm really hoping there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Has anyone here had success switching from one to another? These side effects feel 10 times worse than the depression and I'm just hoping to come out the other side stronger.",depression

"I'm miserable and broken I've never had anyone to confide in, no friends, no significant other, my mom's an addict, my dad and brother are insane and on my no contact list. I've never experienced intimacy I can't remember when I haven't been depressed. I've tried so hard to thug it out because I hoped things would get better but they haven't. I'm 19 now, never had friends, never dated anyone, failing college, broke, stuck living with my shit mom, and working a shit job.

I dream every night, about being someone else, I want to die because I'm done with this meaningless life. I've always been suicidal for as long I can remember but it's getting really bad recently, I already have a plan and am one especially bad day away from going through with it. I already attempted multiple times but nothing happened because I fail at everything, but this plan has no chance of failing.

It's clear to me now that things won't get better, the economy of my country is going to shit so I won't be moving out anytime soon, I get shit grades in school even after putting in my all, and I'm innately socially inept so I'll never have a friend or a girlfriend. Day by day I'm in autopilot mode, constantly praying for some freak accident to kill me because I'm too much of a coward to go forward with my plan until something happens that really pushes me over the edge.

Seeing so many people going through their day experiencing things that I'll never experience like love and happiness is torture. Seeing things like fathers teaching their kids how to ride a bike or couples sitting on a bench holding hands makes me feel so depressed, what did I do to deserve a life devoid of the type of intimacy that comes natural to everyone else? It's so bad that I'll be cleaning, and when I see something like a hammer or a knife I get flooded with thoughts and urges to use it to off myself. I can barely pay attention during lecture's because all I can think about is how much I want to die. ",depression

I was admitted to hospital recently with an ectopic pregnancy. This was my chance to die and not have to do anything about it. I could have just left it and died and put an end to it all. But instead I let them remove my baby and now I'm left hollow inside. I wish I had just left the hospital and not told anyone. I could have finally been gone, like I always wanted.

"Am I being dramatic? 
 Heyo this is going to be a long one I’m sorry. I’ve been holding a lot of this in for a very long time. 

 I’m not really sure where to start. I am a female in my early twenties (not that it really matters but maybe it can help explain some of my experience) I am the second of three girls. We are all 2 years apart in age. 

I am a sufferer of depression and have been for as long as I can remember. I often would use self harm as a way to punish myself for anything from mild embarrassment to more complicated feelings from a very young age. When I was around 8 years old I remember praying to god that he would end my life because I didn’t want to be here anymore. With that being said it is fairly evident that I was not an emotionally healthy child. (Unless that is normal?)

Growing up mental illness was not really a topic of conversation in my family, until my older sister attempted self deletion, for the second time in one year. She was 14/15. Looking back that was a very painful time. Fortunately she was unsuccessful and that was the wake up call my parents needed to get her some help, though she was very resistant at first. My older sister and I’s relationship had been pretty strained for a while before that, due to her untreated illness causing her to be a fairly verbally abusive person. And no doubt i was difficult because of the lack of education I had at that point only being 12 or 13 and fairly naive. I remember after her attempt her frustration and anger with me grew. She told me if I had been a better sister she would’ve never been driven to that point, which only damaged our relationship more. 

The following years our home life was pretty intense. My sister’s struggles led her to be very impulsive and she engaged in risk taking behaviors, for example: sleeping around without ever using protection, which for obvious reasons is never a good idea especially at 15. Drinking, abusing prescription drugs (that her psycho bf at the time was feeding her) and also continuing this abusive relationship despite everyone trying to reason with and protect her. This resulted in a lot of tension with the family. And much of my parents spare time was dedicated to reasoning with, consoling, and focusing on my older sister. My younger sister and I were neglected. 

Unfortunately anytime I did show any sadness instead of my usual indifference (a byproduct of internalizing everything for the sake of sanity for me and my parents) my older sister would turn on me. She would compare our experiences convincing me I had nothing to be sad about, my life was perfect. 

In school my older sister was the star. Teachers classmates other parents all loved her. She was very smart a straight A “gifted” student. Teachers would often compare our disposition. She was very beautiful with unique features such as rather stunning blue eyes. She was loud and fun and made everyone feel so important. I was shy and angry. Often told by my older sister I had no social skills. My eyes were dark and soulless, a kind remark made by one of my classmates. I’m still not totally sure what that was supposed to mean lol. Her friend would pick on me. I didn’t receive much attention from guys. And my self esteem was very low. I remember marking my had with a highlighter to remind myself throughout the day not to talk. Because as my older sister told me “nobody gives a f*** about you so don’t f****** talk”. (I don’t want to offend anyone but you get the idea.) Not talking definitely did not help the fact I desperately needed friends. 

I remember breaking down and reaching out to my parents for support. I would vent and complain about my situation and my sister. I was angry so no doubt I sounded crazy at times. My father would often tell me “Oh your life is so difficult” in a very sarcastic tone. Discrediting all of my feelings. At school if I ever vented to any of my classmates about my very popular well liked older sister I was met with unsympathetic glances. My cry’s for help were often discredited because “at least my parents weren’t divorced” which really had no relevance to my situation.

Anyways these blatant instances of invalidation has deeply confused me throughout my life. I often question my sanity and weather when I’m sad if I’m just being a drama queen. I understand many people have had it much harder than me and my heart goes out to them. But do I not have a right to feel hopeless and sad without a reason. 

It was very hurtful throughout my life seeing the difference in which I was treated compared to my sister. She was allowed to cry, to be angry, to scream, and act out. I would express my resentment for how my sister treated me and my parents would defend her telling me I couldn’t understand how terrible she must be feeling. I couldn’t understand the pain she must have felt to drive her to attempt to take her own life. Which wasn’t at all true. I didn’t want to live either. I was just trying to keep my parents from going insane by being the good kid. A sad and misguided attempt to make them proud of me. I wish they would’ve told me they were proud of me in those days. Maybe I wouldn’t be so broken now. 


Despite the fact I was hurting all that time I could never understand taking out all that hurt and anger and sadness on my little sister. I wanted to protect her. I wanted to save her from the awful feelings I often felt. But unfortunately she too took my older sister’s side. So I didn’t have anyone to talk to. And for some strange reason I felt a sense of loyalty to my older sister I never vented to extended family or close family friends. But now I often wonder if all those things have influenced my lack of self esteem, my reoccurring feelings of self doubt, and not feeling like I can trust my feelings. I have a hard time opening up to people when I feel they have hurt me. I don’t feel like I can trust my feelings because I am terrified of being over dramatic and pushing people away. But was my experience normal? Is this how most people feel? Am i playing the victim? I don’t even know. I’m so scared of reaching out for help because I don’t want to give the wrong impression of my family and ruin their reputation. 

Anyways any outside input would be appreciated. But please be nice I still have very low self esteem.

"Disappear forever I don't remember the last time I was happy. Do you ever get out of depression? I don't know what I was like before I had this disease that consumes every part of your body. I am 30 years old, and I don't even know why I am telling this here, since nobody will care.

When I was very little it all started with the separation of my parents, when I was 7 years old or so my father told me something that I think would mark me for life ""I went to a psychic and she told me that your mother will die soon of an illness"", how can you say that to a little girl? A little girl who is also your daughter. From that day on I began to spend nights without being able to sleep, having to call my grandmother to be with me in bed, because I spent the nights crying and suffering, thinking about the death of my loved ones. Now I'm 30 years old and that is still triggering in me. I know that it is normal to be afraid, and that everyone at some point in their life it crosses their mind... but I am not able to live without having that thought in my head, every day, thinking about the suffering that will come when that happens, all the suffering that will come when my mother is no longer there, or even my cat who has been accompanying me these last 12 years and is like a son to me.

  
That's not all. A few years after my parents divorced, my sister, who had been a drug addict for a while, asked my mother for permission to come and live at home with her boyfriend, since they were supposedly going to do renovations in the house where they lived. That's when hell began. Abuse, both physical and psychological, at any time of the day, living in fear 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Although the abuse was directed at my sister, I experienced all of that since I was little. He was an alcoholic. One day he came home drunk and groped me. I tried to report him when I was 16, but since I wasn't of legal age and lived in the same house, I ended up withdrawing the complaint out of fear. My mother was never able to kick them out of the house, until I was 21 when I reported him again, this time effectively, although my sister denied everything. Two years later, she was the one who reported him and he left home (I should also say that during all this time, they decided to have two children at my mother's house, with no space for them, and when they didn't even have money for themselves). I thought that at that moment everything would end, but it didn't. My sister went back to drugs and started bringing men into the house. She also had custody of her two children taken away from her. She was always very much a victim, she blames my aunt for having her children taken away from her when it was her fault, since she often left them alone, she always took them late to school... etc. My sister also mistreated me psychologically, many days I didn't eat simply because I wouldn't listen to her. In all those years I always wondered why my mother didn't do more, why my mother allowed me to live in that environment, why my mother allowed not only one of her two daughters to screw up her life, but both of them.

  
I gradually stopped going to school. I spent many years trying to get a high school diploma, but I always started, went for a few days and then dropped out. Although I ended up getting a high school diploma, it was practically without going to school, just taking the exams. I also stopped living with my sister, and I thought that everything would improve, and obviously it did, but I never stopped being sad. My mother has always given me everything financially... But she is older, and I simply think that I am scum. I have always wanted to have children and for my mother to be able to enjoy them. But here I am... I was left alone, without friends, without anything. I have never worked, I have never paid contributions, the times I tried I ended up so badly, I ended up crying and crying in bed for days. I have always admired people who go to work day after day, do it and that's it. But not me, I am not capable, and it is not a question of being lazy, it is that I cannot, it paralyzes me, it makes me cry non-stop. Everything requires money, I have never found a psychologist to help me. I spent a year waiting for an appointment with the Social Security psychologist, only to be told things like ""it is what it is"" when I told him all this. My grandmother already had a house at my age, my mother too... In the end it's like a fish chasing its tail. I need to be well to work, but I also need to work to be well. I thought 10 years ago, damn, I hope when I work I can save up and take my mother to Germany (she always wanted to go there since her parents emigrated for a while when she was a child)... And I have absolutely nothing. 0 savings. I think the only thing that would save me with money would be a remote job, at least it would help me to be able to pay for the help I need and not have to depend so much on my mother, and I also don't want to tell her how bad I am because she has her problems (she is currently taking care of her bedridden father after a stroke he had two years ago) and I don't want her to feel bad because of me. I don't like anything I used to do, I don't want to do anything anymore. I just spend the days waiting and wishing for one to come when I can't take it anymore.",depression

For three years I have been struggling with CFS/ME which I got after a covid infection. By the way, I am a medical doctor, 29 years old, male. I can say with certainty that this is the most serious disease that exists on planet Earth. If this disease were deadly, then it would not be the worst disease. Precisely because it is not fatal and because the patient suffers terrible symptoms, precisely because it is the most difficult disease.

At the beginning of the disease I was mild, I could work, train, go out, but I was constantly tired and had mild PEM after exertion. As time went on that fatigue and PEM got worse and worse, so I'm currently in bed 90% of the time.
I am not able to work, socialize, I have a girlfriend, because of this disease I also lost my erection. 

Because of this disease, I lost my job, my girlfriend, my friends, my life. I am planning to kill myself, but the eternal separation from my mother makes me very sad. I am very attached to my mother and I love her very much.

"My father's depression is killing himself and I don't know what to do, I need support and help **Background:**

The past two years have made my dad more stressed than he has ever been in his life.  He and my mom downsized their home and moved into an extended stay for \~8 months while their second (much smaller) home was renovated so that they could flip the house.  They ultimately decided to stay in the house, which meant that the cheaper items they decided on now had to be upgraded if it was going to be their permanent home.  While they are re-renovating, they found a crack that is causing a leak in the foundation, and it really stressed him out because now all the newly laid flooring had to be torn up, and their home has been in a state of chaos for a few years while they're getting everything fixed.

**My Dad:**

My dad had a pretty terrible childhood, moving place to place with an alcoholic and narcissistic mother.  However, he was able to pull away from that and become extremely successful in business, providing my brother and I with a comfortable life.  This has given him control issues and caused him to have long decision making processes because of his stinginess and background of being poor despite now having money.  It's also created strain on his relationship with my mother, though she has stayed by his side for over 30 years.

**What Happened:**

Last month (September), my dad was checked into the hospital for the flu.  It wasn't COVID, it wasn't actually the Flu, in fact the doctors/nurses couldn't find anything and said that he was ok to go home.  All they gave him were some OTC meds and fluids.  My dad said the doctors/nurses were trying to kill him (untrue), and at home he almost threw a 'fit' and stopped eating and drinking.  He was taken to \~10 doctors who all said there's nothing physically wrong with him and that he is clinically depressed.  He started saying that he couldn't sleep, which the doctors attributed to stress, and he refused to shower or eat/drink anything that made him extremely dehydrated.  I had to take off work on Tuesday because he was taking large, labored breaths between every word he tried to say and wanted to go to the hospital for IV fluids since he wasn't drinking.  He wanted an ambulance so he wouldn't have to wait in triage in the ER, and instead I ordered a mobile IV unit to give him fluids and he felt better.  He said he keeps throwing up, but he won't take anti-nausea medication.  He took Lexapro for two weeks, which is not long enough to make it even work, and he said he can't take it anymore.  The next day he said he felt better off the Lexapro and was prescribed Zofran, but he can't take it because he has to 'first come down from the Lexapro (?).

Things came to a head this weekend when I decided to take my mom with my family to a theme park so that she could get out.  I set my dad up with food/drink/etc. and when we came back, he hadn't eaten/drank anything and looked terrible.  I took his BP and it was 179/80, and I called an ambulance.  The doctors said that he would have died if we waited, and he went into emergency dialysis and then had a TIA stroke the next day that landed him in the ICU.  His kidneys might have completely failed because of his lack of hydration and refusal to drink.

**Advice that I Need:**

I understand that my dad is clinically depressed.  However, it seems like because of his inability to control things, he can only control what he eats/drinks/etc. so that's what he's trying to do.  He has psychologists and psychiatrists, but the main focus now is getting him food/water/sleep, and he won't even do that.  When I ask him how he's doing, he lies and tells me he eats and drinks when he didn't and that he's feeling/looking better when he's not.  We can't figure out how to help him, and it's causing us to become frustrated and confused.

If anyone has some advice on how to deal with this, I would greatly appreciate it.  I'm going to therapy myself to get through this, and my poor mom is going through burnout because he won't do anything she suggests (eat, sleep, drink, walk, sit up, etc.).

My mom is at the hospital and just called me saying the doctors said he was fine and then when she walked in he tried to make himself throw up, but since he has nothing in his stomach he was just dry heaving with some spittle (the doctor said that he didn't do that until my mom got there).

Thank you in advance!

"Is anyone else here constantly bitter and angry at everyone and everything all the time?  I’m sick and tired of feeling this way.

They deserve better than me. I don’t know how to handle it. Looking from other peoples perspective, everything seems normal in my life but nothing actually is.

"help Long story short, My Husband started acting strange in March, then seemed really manic for two or three months. He was emotionally unavailable, distant, and angry. He was also paranoid. He filed for divorce, then took it back and said it was a mistake. He ended up in the psych ward for four days. And for the last few months, he’s been experiencing the darkest depression ever.  after the psych ward they added olanzapine and that didn’t really do much. Then several weeks later they added lithium (ten days ago). his current meds are 200mg sertraline,  small dose of olanzapine, clonopine and lithium.  he’s been so so so depressed, can’t hold a conversation, can’t get out of bed for days, and doesn’t work anymore. he says his depression is not getting better. But he’s not on the full dose of lithium yet, he’s had his second blood test Friday and a meeting with the psychiatrist tomorrow to see if they are going to up the lithium. is there any hope for recovery? i am starting to feel depression myself, i don’t know if i can live like this. i’m a mom of 3 and it’s really taken it’s toll.

"Emotionally scarred  Hi, I’m a woman 33 years old and I’ve felt so lost for so long. I was very sheltered growing up and I’m so confused on how to make a man happy. I don’t mean to sound narcissist, but I am very attractive and never thought it would be a problem finding a man. I had a huge secret crush on a friend and I made the first move, and he was over the moon initially. I wanted this relationship to work out for so long and I’ve known him for 15 years. What does it mean when your boyfriend won’t touch you? I walk around completely naked and he won’t even snuggle. I have to reach out and make him touch me. And then it doesn’t always lead into sex. At first I thought it would get easier, but he pushed himself farther and farther away. My love language is touch and affirmations, but he never tells me how good I look until I ask him what he thinks. I want to feel appreciated and like a true woman, but my patience has gone out the window and I turn almost violent. And I’m just asking him to hug me or hold me. 

Our worst fight we ever had was over him not wanting to spend an evening out with our friends. We were living together for almost 4 years and things were getting tense during Covid in a tiny studio with not much space. I wanted to hang out with our friends bc he seems to loosen up, but when he said he might just do something else I freaked out and took his car keys and parked his car only one street up, but when I got back he was on the phone with the police saying I was acting violent when I grabbed the keys and the police wound up arresting me and I freaked out completely. The cops were so demeaning to me and it only made me more angry. I had to bail myself out for 5k with help from another friend. My mother found out and wouldn’t even help me. I felt so abandoned. He wound up paying me back 6 months later. He threw out most of my things and packed up the rest and dropped it off at my mom’s house all behind my back. I was so emotionally hurt and I just wanted everything to be good again. He apologized and said he didn’t know that would happen when he called the police, but we didn’t get back together for almost a year. I thought I could make things work and now I just feel used. He told his family about this and now I’m never invited to anything. I have felt so lonely and angry with the world. I don’t feel like I really have a voice, and all I want is for life to be a beautiful fairytale. 

Any advice would be absolutely appreciated, thank you so much in advance. ",depression

"Why can't I just buckle down and live life like a normal person?  I feel like this every day.

I started feeling better in March. I was finishing up some personal counseling. We got a puppy and I felt purpose again (which sounds terrible because I have a 17 year old at home). I had something that needed me. I woke up early to let him out and play. I attended training classes with him. Brought him everywhere to socialize. 

I started to feel better. Took vacations with my partner and son. Had family outings. I started taking better care of the house, started eating better, cooking and took on more chores. I planned to go back to school. I was so excited to get back to reality. 

And then our puppy was diagnosed with cancer and passed away within a week. He wasn't even 9 months old. 

I immediately went back to my depressive state and haven't been able to dig myself out of this hole.

"Don’t know what to do anymore  Hi guys, I’m just going to share some thoughts that have been on my mind lately. I have very limited support system, so getting some feedback and outside opinions on my circumstances will be nice. 

This year I’ve lost my best friend who I’ve been with since middle school. I have also lost my sister who I grew up with for basically all twenty five years of my life. 
Starting off with my best friend, we had multiple conflicts and miscommunication during the months before her wedding. We went to a small shop together to find a wedding dress for her, all went fairly well, I even got my bridesmaid dress from there. Knowing she’s on a budget, I offered to pay half of her dress as my gift for her wedding. However, my bridesmaid dress was never shipped, no notification either for weeks. I asked her, if she have received her wedding dress yet since we ordered it from the same shop, and she said yes, she have retrieved it yesterday. I was a little offended by it since she never reach out to question the status of my dress, considering that she have gotten hers. I ended up asking for a refund because the shop was taking forever to get the bridesmaid dress ready, and ordered elsewhere to make the process simpler. Then, I suggested we should get the dress tailored together. I told her the days that I’m available to met, and she completely disregarded that. She made a appointment on my work day and suggested me to come. After clarifying it with her, she suggested a different day, but at that point I didn’t want to add anymore stress for the both of us. I told her how about we each separately get our dresses fixed and tailored? Fault on my part for being wishy washy because she got upset, stating that she was being flexible and I refused to work it out with her and rather do things separately. Fast forward, I apologized again and again, tried to call two times to talk it out, all of which she refuse to corporate. We went on a month without talking after that. I was stubborn, I refuse to keep begging for forgiveness if I’ve already apologized several times…finally, on the month of her wedding, she send me a lengthy paragraph basically telling me let’s end the ten year friendship, before permanently blocking me. 
This happened on my birthday month in June. On that same month, I had a heated argument with my sister who have went through thick and thins with me. My sister who I grew up with, is my main support system, I relied heavily on her. We traveled to multiple places from out of country to in states. We share many similarities, enjoy the same hobbies together, talk on the phone for hours and when she visits me, keep each other company every single day. (You can see how this will not end well). To cut it short, we had multiple arguments even gotten a little physical, which is a fault on both of us. Right after her graduation, jobless, she told me she’s moving to a different state with her boyfriend she met for three months..logically that’s a normal thing for a young adult to do. But on my end, I can’t help but felt extremely hurt, upset, and disappointed. I understand it’s not her fault for seeking out what she wanted in life, it is her life after all. But I just felt upset over this. Few years back, she would ask if I wanted to live with her after graduation, and it’s just shocking how time changes everything. Having a sensitive, emotional, and sentimental personality makes coping with this ten times worst. As expected, we started to grow distant, going from phone calls every day to barely any messages or calls now. She tried to reach out to me once in a while, asking how I am, but I didn’t really wanted to engage in making a conversation anymore. I think I still couldn’t accept how she could just drop everything and leave, with basically a stranger she’s have met instead of staying in the comfort of my place. But it is her life at the end of the day. 

I should’ve had met more people back then, now with two of my main supporters gone, everyday felt heavier and heavier to get by. Getting “haunted” by those past memories constantly, just suck all the motivations to do anything out of me. 
Anyway, if you have read this far, thank you for taking up your time to do so. ",depression

"I don't know what there is to look forward to. Half of me wants help and the other half wants to be left alone. The only reason I'm even putting it on reddit is that I practically refuse to find a new therapist for the millionth time. Nothing they say works for me and I don't think they can say anything to me that I couldn't say to myself for free. Knowing that I'm paying someone to misinterpret me places a permanent wall between us.

I hate saying ""I wish I was dead"" because I know that's not the solution to the problem. But like man I am the cause of my problems half the time. So maybe it is. Idk.

I set myself up to be judged because my brain never ever ever stops thinking for a second and I don't trust myself to know for sure if I've done something wrong. But then I get all mad if someone says yes. I'm not even mad at them, I'm mad at myself for asking. I'm mad at myself for getting input. Especially in a place like reddit (yet here I am). I'm mad at myself for continuing to obsess over things that I can't change, and making myself a fool in the process. I don't know how anybody can stand to be around me. Something just isn't right and I can pretend I'm getting better but in the end I'm just pretending.

I feel like my brain doesn't work. Or it does, but too much in the wrong place, and some other part simply never got the message.

"The loneliest chapter of my life Hi everyone so I've just made a new reddit account to post this because for me, its too big of a burden to carry on my own and I don't feel like I can talk to anyone in my life about it. 

Over the past couple of months, I've just finished my degree (in a niche subject) and I haven't found any work in anything I can call good - I am unemployed, just moved back home with my parents to my very quiet home town. I am mid-20s, without a job, prospects for a job, a partner, all my friends have left the town to get married, have children, pursue careers etc and I have never in my life experienced the brutal loneliness of watching everybody I love, move on. 

I stand so against being dependent on parents that have done the most for me but here I am, crying so hard to my computer screen, writing about myself fall into a depression about my life online. I don't know what to do, I feel so helpless and I just wanted to know (because when I speak to any friends about what or how I'm doing, its never any help because I just feel like I'm exposing my insecurities to people without these concerns), who out there, has navigated the common difficulty of being in your 20s and failing to find a path. I have worked, travelled, and filled my time with things until now where I need to stick to something real, and I am failing. 

If there is anyone out there who has experienced this, please reach out and talk to me, I am really outgoing and happy to talk with anyone, I will reply to all comments, but for a more detailed chat and to get to know someone and their situation and how they've overcome it, please dm me - I promise to reply to them all. I am just so afraid of watching my life flash before me, at the moment I'm such a passenger in my existence and I'm falling faster and deeper into a seriously bad depression. 

Is anyone experiencing this now? How did anyone else overcome this part of life? 

To those of you who relate in anyway and read this without replying, I hope you manage to fins what drives you into a better place and always feel comfortable enough to message me.

  
Thankyou world <3 ",depression

"After a Breakup, I’m Trying to Become a Better Version of Myself—But Should I Aim to Reconnect or Move On? Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice and perspective here. Recently, I went through a tough breakup, and it’s really pushed me to reflect on myself and how I want to grow. I’ve decided to focus on three main areas:

2. Studying like a scientist, really diving into my academics and career goals.
3. Developing my social skills like a diplomat, becoming more open, humorous, and approachable.

"Recovered from depression but still exhausted? I’ve always gone through severe periods of depression, with my last one finishing up in March time this year. It’s been okay, I’ve been good. Doing hobbies and seeing friends and generally having an okay time. I feel fairly hopeful for the future, I’m still struggling sometimes with anxiety but it’s manageable. I’ve even got my first job post-uni. But everything is so, so tiring. 

I can’t tell if it’s the high dose of antidepressants (but I’ve been on them years already) or if it’s lingering depression in general, perhaps as a much lower level than before. Maybe I just don’t notice a mild depression because I’m so used to it being so severe. But I get so tired so easily. It’s mental and physical, it’s just exhaustion. I do the basic stuff, like showering and going to work, but I barely have the energy to eat by the end of the day. I struggle to motivate myself to have a proper meal because I don’t even feel hungry, all I feel is shattered. I sleep, and wake up okay. And then I do almost nothing and I’m tired again. 

There’s no way everyone is this tired all the time. I just want to rest, do simple things. It feels like each day takes three days recovery before I have enough motivation or energy to do something fun again. And when given the time, I do enjoy things. It’s not like I’m incapable of enjoying myself or feeling excited for the future. But I have to work most days and in turn, it feels like I don’t have the time to recover AND do things I enjoy. Between working, it feels like the rest of the time is spent recovering or preparing for work, be it sleeping or doing something mindless. And to top it off, I’m not even working that much. It’s part time, it’s not even full working hours. It makes me nervous to think that I can barely cope with this.

Is this depression? I don’t feel depressed. I just feel tired. I feel happy but absolutely shattered. I could have sworn it was physical but my bloods are fine and mentally it’s like I’m mostly doing okay. Even therapy is going good and she sees my improvement - I have improved so much.

"If I need to tell my therapist to teach me coping skills, are they the wrong therapist for me? I've been receiving therapy for around a month now. I meet with my clinician once every week.

I was extremely happy going in to it because I didn't want to be depressed and anxious about everything anymore. But when I talked to my therapist i kind of didn't feel too impressed. Sorry, I know how arrogant this sounds. I think they're just not the right one for me...?

But I digress, I practiced what I preach and continued to see this therapist despite being kind of unimpressed. It's kind of early. Perhaps I'm just being too pessimistic...

But idk... I think this is my fourth or fifth time seeing them now and I kind of feel like nothing is actually working...

Don't get me wrong. I'm happy my therapist told me x and y. But the big issue is - I need a job. I need to make money... I don't got a lot of money left and pretty soon I will be homeless... I'd like to be able to talk to a coworker and not feel threatened and or competitive. it ruined a ton of my relationships with coworkers. And not just coworkers. But basically family and friends too...!

My therapist is teaching me a lot of things, such as what depression is and how each example I'm giving him of my past events are affecting my life. But I don't think they are helpful. I feel like I am just talking to a robot. If I don't start the conversation, my therapist doesn't talk to me. It's kind of awkward.. most of the things they tell me, it's kind of just them reading in the between the lines and rephrasing what I said back to me.

Today felt extremely bad because I had to take a bus to see the therapist (I don't usually take the bus). I got a bit confused with the bus system so I texted my therapist if it was okay I was going to be a little late. They text back and said ""it's okay. We can have a shorter session today"". Which made me feel like A) extremely disrespected B) I wasnt getting my money's worth

And then to top it off. My therapist always looks at the time and tells me something along the lines of ""oops, won't you look at that. We've been talking for so long. Times flies by"". When in reality I feel like I was the only one doing any sort of talking.

I need resources like coping skills. The reason I came here in the first place today was because my therapists told me we'd work on breathing techniques and stuff to stop feeling anxious in a certain scenario. But whenever I get to see my therapist, they always don't remember what we were talking about and it makes me feel like I'm a unimportant or something.

After a whole month with them, I was finally thinking it's time to look for a different therapist, but I can't talk to them about it because I'm afraid of confrontations and stuff. I get anxiety thinking about it. I don't got family or friends and currently nobody knows I'm seeing a therapist for depression (I was clinically diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder here, but the initial reason I came to therapy was because I think I knew I had depression).

I don't want to be mean but I think I'm just wasting time... It's cool I'm finally brushing my teeth and taking a shower like normal again, now. I think my therapist kind of helped steer me towards this progress, but it's off course... Hopefully somebody understands what I mean... Because I can't find the correct words and things to say from time to time...",depression

"I feel like no one around me understand the depressive believes i have so i made a kind of story. Maybe some people can relate. Its a big read. TL;DR added. What it is like

TL;DR

I’ve been struggling with depression for over four years, feeling alone and misunderstood. Although my friends try to help, they don't truly get what I'm going through. I'm scared that being honest about my feelings will make others see me as a failure, so I constantly try to prove my worth in every part of my life. This pressure leaves me feeling stuck and questioning my value. I fear that if I reach out for help, I’ll be judged or given superficial advice, making it hard for me to connect with others or find the support I need.

What it is like

Alone. I feel so alone in life. I feel like being in the middle of a crossing on the street and everyone walking past me busy with their lives. Meanwhile I am standing still unable to move. Unable to get anyone’s attention. Unable to ask for help.

I am struggling with depression for over 4 years or longer and no one ever understand me. I cannot make people understand me. I know people notice but they don’t know what to do. So, they just leave me alone. Which is the opposite of what I want. But I can’t reach out.

I feel like if I reach out people will not understand me or give superficial advice. After which I seem like someone who just wants to stay depressed.

My friends know I am not 100% and they try in their own way to motivate me but they just don’t understand what it is like. I feel like if I am truly honest about my feelings people will see me for the loser, I think myself I am. The loser who won’t get further in life and will remain stuck. Stuck in a repeated pattern constantly fighting against myself and winning just enough to survive through the days.

I don’t want anyone to think of me as a failure. I have been a failure all my life. I want people to know me as successful, proud, honest, kind and interesting. Not depressed, lonely, failing and boring. Which is my opinion of myself.

It feels like all aspects of my life are hanging by a thread. I hold the strings together by portraying myself how I want people to see me. Because I am afraid that if I stop fighting and show them how much of a failure in life I really am they will leave me over time. Distancing themselves from me because I am the only one who cannot move forward. And going through this life without them feels like a death sentence. I cannot fathom why they would want to be friends with someone like me. In the current state that I am in. I cannot fathom being the one in a friendship with nothing to offer. Which I think I am. But am not admitting nor acting in this way. I go over mountains to give value to friendships and meet ups and parties so people will be content with me. I feel like they will leave when I have nothing to give. When I am at my lowest.

Furthermore, it scares me being at my lowest. I waste my potential day by day by surviving this way. It scares me when I look in the mirror and see in what for pit I am. Like being in the darkness of space and seeing this one star. This one star that represents the joys I still experience today.

A star that just keeps getting further and further away from me until there is nothing anymore. Just me in this survival state. Unable to get better. All bridges burned. All hopes of support gone. Waiting for the end.

Its even come to a point where I just accept, I am a failure stuck in life with friends leaving and being lonely in life and death that I forget the very things that make me feel this way.

Why. Why am I feeling this way?

I feel like I have accomplished nothing of worth in my life. I have a life but have nothing to show for it. I can’t justify my existence. I feel like I have to do something extraordinary to be worthy of it. I feel like I have to prove I am worthy of having gotten this far. I need something to show for it. And I got nothing.

Most of my childhood I was rejected by almost everyone. My childhood was literally the busy crosswalk.

It went better later in life when I was actively pursuing a good job through my studies and was accepted by my classmates. Now when I have a good job I have to prove I am worthy of it. Every project I work on has the potential to make me worthy or unworthy of my job. And even my best may not be enough against my competition aka coworkers.

This feeling of having to prove I am good enough has spread to every corner of my life. From my job to my relationships to my aspirations, needs and wants. If I feel like I did not prove myself enough I will be unworthy of any aspect of life that comes that day.

 

Sometimes at my job I feel like I have proven myself for the day and I feel proud and act as I want. Free expression. Yet in many areas of my life, I rarely or never feel worthy.

I constantly do not feel worthy of a relationship or love. For what is there to love? I may be kind, funny or any other bland aspects found in most boring personalities but I do not have a wow factor which will make worthy of love. That one special quality or aspect of personality that will convince me I am worthy.

And here comes the most bland, superficial, boring, unusable advice ever given in the history of advice.

“Don’t worry about it that much”

Let’s go back to the crossing. That one crossing where I am standing in the middle with everyone walking past me. Eventually someone walks up to me and sees just me standing in the middle and says: why don’t you just move?

The thought of just taking step after step seems simple enough. But in what direction? And even then. As I am about to take a step my body freezes like an electrical current is flowing through my muscles tightening it so that I cannot move.

A shadow of myself appears and tells me:

*What have you proven to be worthy of moving. And are you certain that you will be worthy of taking this action after you have reached your destination. For if you are not you will never walk again. Then you will have certainty you are to remain in the middle of this busy crossing. Are you willing to moving to an unknown destination with the risk of never being able to move again.*

 is example might seem far fetched so here is another.

Say I am at a party of sorts and get a girl’s attention. Which is already pretty rare because of how I hide myself from it. Let’s say we hit it off and we eventually get on a date. On the date she discovers that I have a kinda interesting job, still lives at home, mostly game, sometimes goes on a walk or take a swim. Has many hobbies which he does not really participate in. Hangs out mostly with his friends drinking a beer. And had one previous relationship which wasn’t really that well structured. The girl eventually figures out that this is kinda boring and uninteresting. She decides to leave.

In this scenario I present my true self and that is not worthy enough.

Of course, I already have a feeling of unworthiness so this will be an outcome no matter what.

As long as I believe I am unworthy of love I will be unworthy of love. And as long as my life is the way it is now in terms of accomplishments, I will believe I am unworthy of love. Love of any kind that is.

Now the next step might be obvious. Change the way my life is. And here comes the cycle. For I have not been idle and have tried this many times.

I seek to walk away from the busy crosswalk. I take a step. I ignore the words of my shadow. I keep walking in a certain direction. But I never arrive anywhere. I look in the distance and do not see the thing I want. The thing I think will change my life for the better albeit small. Withered by a feeling of defeat and a hopeless thought of not finding what I am looking for I turn back to familiar ground. The busy crosswalk. At least here I have perspective. I turn into another street. I see something that might help me. Some aspect which will make my life more worthy. For a time walking down this street feels good. But eventually the road begins to turn so steep I fall down. I try again and fall down, again. I look and look but find no way to climb it. Looking at my watch I am shocked how much time has passed by exploring 2 streets. I have spent so much time achieving nothing that I give up and return to the crosswalk. Waiting for the perfect path to arrive so I won’t waste any more time with the pursuit of illusionary paths of change.",depression

"Is this depression? Let me start off by saying I’ve never been a talented writer or overly skilled with my words. This is for all intents and purposes just for me to vent. Recently I went through a heartbreaking breakup and it opened a lot of doors into my inner demons. I’m seen by most who know me as a strong man both mentally and physically but the reality is I am always scared. I’m scared of showing my weakness to anyone. I’m tired of being the “strong” one of everyone. Atlas has the world on his shoulders yet I’m here being crushed by my own thoughts.  I have so much anger, sadness, and hate towards myself for failing to live up to the expectations of success and strength. I haven’t found ways to dispel these emotions despite my efforts to. I truly wish for death a lot of times and the only thing holding me back is my obligations to my loved ones. I’m living solely for others while simply existing. Nothing would be better for me to simply die a hero’s death so they could remain proud in their memories of me. Is it acceptable to live for only others? I’m my father’s only child so I can’t let my bloodline end it would be a disservice to his memory. I’m one of two children to my mother but the only one in touch with her. If I die, she won’t survive it and she has plenty of good to bring to the world still. My friends would all cast blame onto themselves for not seeing it or preventing it simply resulting in more pain. Without me I know there would be a lot more pain to my loved ones but none of them actually know the real me. I’ve always hidden myself behind a calculating mask out of fear. When I’m sad ill smile and joke my way through it to simply fall apart alone. When talking I run scenarios through my head to calculate the best things to say. When with the love of my life I’d make excuses to not dance with her for fear of embarrassing myself because no one has seen me fail at something. I know some people would be accepting of me being goofier and free but I’ve always been the smart, strong one, who is good at everything they try. I’m sure a lot of these feelings stem from my childhood of constant moving. I’ve lost most of the friends I’ve made through life due to moving so often. Maybe it has built such a sense of loss I feel its only a matter of time until I lose more. I have no motivation anymore and have let myself get out of shape. I own a business that my lack of drive is destroying. I’ve looked up to God but what is that if not living for another still. I don’t know the point of my own existence. I was a promising multisport athlete but gave it up for fear of failing. I was a promising fighter but gave it up for fear of failing. I was a promising business owner multiple times yet they end in failure due to my lack of drive. I have the ability to achieve almost anything but my mental fortitude is simply gone. Am I simply here to survive behind a mask of fear while being strong for everyone else? I have no hesitation to put my life in danger for others but why? Is it courage or do I simply value a stranger’s life over my own at this point? All I want to do is feel pride and happiness in myself but how I do that while hiding so much of me? I don’t fear death nor any man yet I’m paralyzed at the thought of disappointing those around me. I’ve survived dozens of close calls with death throughout my life but I still can’t figure out why I’m here. If I’m truly designed to be the stepping stone that lifts up everyone else while I slowly sink into the abyss then so be it but I’m forced to forever wonder why. Is finding purpose truly that hard? I will continue to live just like many other men will behind my mask of fear and hopefully one day the pieces will all fall into place for me. I just wanted to share incase there were others with feelings similar to know they aren’t alone. If I ever find the answer I look forward to possibly updating this in the future.",depression

Family is sick of me I can see it in the way they look at me when I talk to them about something or ask them about something and I can hear it in the way they respond to me. It makes me want to go completely mute because I can tell they don’t want me interacting with them. It’s like they look at me and I can just see the disgust and resentment. I feel judged every single time I open my mouth. I keep asking myself why do I even try but I just keep doing it anyway. It’s just so obvious. I just feel like an idiot and it just seems to prove that it would be better for them if I wasn’t around.,depression

"Im tired I'm feeling incredibly exhausted and depressed. The thought of going to school fills me with anxiety, and I've completely lost my motivation to continue, and im constantly absent in some of my classed. I'm seriously considering dropping out, but I know that's not a realistic option in a third-world country where a college degree is essential for even a minimum-wage job.

Taking a gap year seems appealing, but I'm worried it would be a waste of time and academic progress and my family would most likely not support it either. I've chosen a course that doesn't interest me, and I lack any real ambition or drive. No course in general interests me. All I want to do is stay in bed and avoid the world. I can't imagine myself having a successful career.

I've tried to force myself to enjoy school and complete assignments, but I always fall back into procrastination and negativity. I've sought help from a school counselor and tried to followed her advice, but I keep relapsing.

"I lost my motivation to live. (TW: suicide of a family member) I made some great progress in terms of self care these last two years. I found a new job, started going to the gym, established a stable sleepung schedule, improved my diet, gained weight (i was underweight) and improved my social relations with my family. 

Life wasnt easy but things were moving in the right direction until my father took his life 2 months ago. Changed everything. Im not crying all the day its just like i lost all motivation to live. I quit my job in an act of self sabotage a month later. I didnt like that job but i really needed it. It wasnt even planned i just felt so horrible there and the last couple of days were so rough with me hiding my crying behind the monitor and i just snapped and quit without a back up plan. 

Ive been sending out lots of resumes since then but im starting to loose hope and motivation. 

I sleep very long these days and i dont want get up no more. I just keep laying there even after waking up to avoid facing the day. 

I dont take care of myself aswell. 

I dont do as much sport.

I eat less and worse.

Eating feels like a chore rn. I only get quick craving for junkfood but no actual appetite for an actual meal.

I still send out a resume here and there but im at the point where i have to wait 1-2 days for new jobs to be posted online because i pretty much applied to everything im suited for already.

Im ashamed to call my family because i feel like a total failure and a looser. I dont want them to know that i messed up this hard again after making so much progress these last 2 years...

While im not planning anything stupid i cant deny that a part of me wants to follow my dad.

"I don't believe this is mental health what is this? Doctors keep saying i have anxiety but I feel I have control and am able to control myself, the issue for me feels like more of a physiological response that causes increased anxiety for me. As an example there's times where I get super derealized which will typically make me anxious, I was horrible at managing that before but now I feel i am able to put up with it and know im safe and feel reassured that I will be fine once I get rest or something and know its more temporary. when I go on long drives I feel really really weird getting out of the car, like almost dizzy and derealizaed also, and most the time im lacking energy. I feel unable to do work and feel my brain is always numbed out and disconnected from everything instead of feeling what I would consider to be normal. I had low cortisol months ago in response to an acth stimulation test and recently got my cortisol levels checked again and my acth which were normal but didn't do the stimulation test again, if anything was abnormal the acth should have been high. I assumed this was the issue for months but now I really don't know all I know is im never taking anxiety medication again because it fucked me up so bad last time, lexapro and buspirone caused me so much pain and fucked up my brain over time. I was so tired i felt like I was dying also it fucked me up bad when i smoked weed while on it, I was screaming and almost hallucinating and thought I died for a second. I also took Accutane a few years ago and that gave me brain fog also. I don't trust medications now and it honestly seems remarkable there's so many people on these subreddits that say they've tried so many medications and act like they love medication. I assume these people are just so far gone now and don't realize it because our brain chemistry is so sensitive no one understands. So I ask what am i supposed to do because I don't know anymore and my endocrinologist said hes not rescheduling an appointment if everything comes back normal. I've had other very clear and obvious symptoms for other physical issues I've had and what im starting to learn about the medical establishments is they don't really commonly diagnose people, I never get clear answers even after years.

"A final goodbye.  I grew up in a conflicting family, tiresome honestly. I gave up on the a long while ago, fell into the urge to kill myself by 12 but I was stupid enough to not attempt anything. At the 13 I met my best friend, the only person I have ever truly cared about honestly. She was the only one who cared to listen to my blabbering anyways. I have spent more good time with her than anyone, all my good rememberable memories are with her. 

At 16 I fell in love. I did. 


I know it wasn't a healthy type of love, it was obsession. No not a controlling obsession, but one where she became the centre of my life. But I did it anyway, because there I did the biggest mistake, thinking that she reciprocated them. I gave her flowers, chocolates, what not? And it's honestly a long story. All until, last month. 


She introduced me to her future fiance. Yeah. She was getting engaged (arrange). I don't know how to describe myself after that. I haven't smiled ever since, I haven't felt anything positive. Last week I snapped at her. And had a huge argument where I accused her of leading on me and ofcourse; confessed. She left with a ""I am sorry"" I blocked her everywhere. I haven't felt anything ever since, I am living on instant noodles and have not have had any contact with outside World. 

I don't know what will hurt her more, the fact that the next she'll ever see of me is my dead body, or that she'll know that she could have stopped it. Deep down, I know none of this was her fault. But anyways.

I hate it. I really wish that i can work instead of going to school but I'm still a minor. If I have to go through this till I'm 22 then I would much rather die. I've thought of suicide multiple times (not all school related issues) but I won't actually do it because I'm too scared and I can't bear the thought of my parents and friends losing me wondering what went wrong. I've been skipping school for over a week now and will be force to go tomorrow. I can't go on like this but I don't know what to do.",depression
How to tell folk  I js got a bf kinda and I don’t know how to tell him or even if I want to tell him. He knows I’m struggling but he doesn’t know how bad. He knows that I tried to kms in the past but he doesn’t know that it was recent. So he knows but not fully. Should I even tell him ,depression
"Im gonna plunge a knife into my chest soon I can’t take it anymore I really can’t. All I’ve been able to think about is stabbing myself and dying violently it’s all I want. I’ve been an absolute fucking mess after my ex left me and I’m so damm lonely it’s been six months and I can’t get them out of my head still. I have everything I need to do it. I want to see them one last time before I gut myself with a hunting knife, maybe if I’m lucky they will hold me while I bleed to death on the floor, all I want is to feel them hold me again. When I was with them the violent thoughts of self mutilation stopped and I was finally happy and know they have just been louder and more constant ever since they left me. 

Maybe I’ll try Friday night I have a sledgehammer to break in through a window and then I can see them again before I can finally do what I’ve been wanting to do so desperately for years now and finally stab myself right in my chest and drag the knife down into me to keep tearing me apart. I feel bad that they have to see me do that but I want to see them in my final moments so badly.

Maybe talking to someone here can help but I dunno I feel pretty hopeless and don’t think anything is gonna help with these thoughts.",depression
"Having the suicide option and preparing feels calming I'm diagnosed with a major depressive episode, everything feels like shit right now. Troublesome marriage since years and it's taking more and more a toll on me. I still have faith that we will be able to work it out in the end. 

Planning suicide gives me a sense of feeling clear and collected. Especially if I don't know how to move forward or how to find strength, planning ways how to do it and testing first steps creates the feeling of controll. 

While I know that this is a dangerous path to walk on, I can't seem to find anything else which has the same effect for me. ",depression
"I think that most don’t want to see the bad I don’t have anyone to talk to. I find that to be a good and sometimes a bad thing. For the people that are in my life, I can’t reach out. People don’t want to actually hear how bad you’re feeling because it makes them uncomfortable or they have their own shit to deal with. Some people just don’t like hearing the negativity. 

I do think that maybe we’ve just done this life thing before. Maybe depression is just the underlying exhaustion of living life over and over again, and death is the only real exit button for temporary relief. 

I want to hope for better so I try to further myself in life but I don’t want to anymore. I want to drop out of school and just leave without a word. I feel like I’ve always just been around people who didn’t really see me. I’ve always felt like I’ve had to tiptoe. I have to be there for them but who is really there for me? I get some relief through whatever form I’ve isolation I can get. 

If I leave, I wonder if my feelings of suicide would become worse? Sometimes I wish that suicide was easily painless and whatever is left of this body would never be found. I don’t want anything to be left behind. I wish I were intelligent enough to come up with a plan that would guarantee that. ",depression
"Had a breakdown after seeking help again I swallowed my despair and sought out a therapy clinic to talk to someone. I spent an hour telling a counselor all the reasons I wanted to die, why life was something I hated, etc. 

She gave me a cup of water and told me to go outside more. That’s it. I got in my car and had a meltdown. This is treatment?

"Realization  So posting on another person's post i realized something, its not that I am depressed about my past full of abuse, neglect, and exploitation, but the fact that no matter how much effort I put into making life better, it doesn't get better unless I get lucky. 

Stuck working for shit pay cause of rich assholes.
Working more of my life than with loved ones.
Never able to enjoy things cause of cost.

I busted my ass after being kicked out to work and go to school, got my degree, found a partner, kept working my ass off. Fucking nowhere in life. Just started making a teachers salary at 38 after 20 years of making just above minimum wage. No hope for retirement, never gonna make enough to travel and enjoy places, see my partner less than my coworkers, my friends even less, and all I can do to pass the time is hobbies that keep getting more expensive.

I don't see the point in continuing, but do for my partner. I hope every day that some fluke kills me so that at least I'm not the one inflicting the suffering on my partner, but not a lucky guy so still here. ",depression

"What is Happening to me?  What is happening to me? Depression ? Adhd? Excuses ? 


I (m25) feel like something is happening to me. Something bad. For about 2months now I constantly feel irritated, unhappy, procrastination is at an all time high, constantly comparing myself to others, being not actively grateful for the things I have. (Flat, loving/supportive family, being able to go to uni for free etc.) I feel so lost like never before, it paralyzes me. I have no structure, no routines. I get nothing done anymore, at least nothing of substance. Everything I start I become really obsessed with and usually get really, really good at in a very short period of time. For an example sports. Every sport I played I was exceptionally good at. Soccer multiple awards, American Football( Invitational to All-American as Kicker)(this was during my year abroad), and now its Muay Thai. I went to Thailand 2months and the krus (teachers) there said I am very talented and gifted and very good and they were suprised when I told them I only started this journey in February this year. This is where it turns, I compare myself to the absolute best in every department.Which is delusional. I compare myself to people who have been doing it all their life day after day and not to the person I was in the past. 
2 weeks ago I ran a marathon just for fun, completed it not fast enough for my standards. Last week Saturday I tried a Triathlon, 1.12h 40km cycling, 48min 10km jog and 1,2km swimming. I cramped up and couldn’t finish it. My response was that I told myself what a little b1tc4 I was. This is without any specific marathon or triathlon training. 

I am attractive, girls and guys tell me regularly, I have a athletic body. I am a good listener. I can articulate myself pretty good. (English is my 2nd language).I finished an apprenticeship,I have a car, an attractive girlfriend inside as well as outside. But no matter what I have going for myself it never seems to be enough. I can’t appreciate anything anymore, which frightens me.My friends think I am very disciplined and very role model like, but I feel like a total fraud. I don’t lie but still I don’t feel worthy. I should be proud but I don’t allow myself to feel the joy. 

Uni for me is merely an alibi, I use it as a excuse for myself so that I at least can say I study. I am spoiled, getting money from my parents. But can’t even go properly to university as it should be. My girlfriend of about 1y is great and our relationship is very strong, relative to the time. But she senses it as well. This behavior might be a problem in the future. 
I feel extremely drained some days. I sometimes just lay in bed all day. Sometimes I get ready, head to uni and just turn around to go back home.


Nothing feels real anymore. 8 months ago everything was going great, now everything seems to crumble apart. Everything feels frustrating and I don’t know what is happening to me. 

For the future I want to help people, I would like to teach or consult.I want to build a family.I want to care for my family and devote my life to them. I want to be financially stable. I want to train hard and be the best human I can be. I just want to live actively again.",depression
"I give up :) To be honest it was a long time since i opened up about me but here I'm.

I didnt have any friends, I dont have it today also to be honest.Everytime i had someone in my life it woud end bad, I dont wanna go in any details but i was pretty good person, I was that person who will do anything for u and i was really emotional.Last year that version of me disapperaed.

"How do I become happy again? I dont even know how to give context for this bc I always feel dramatic.

I am freshman girl in college. My boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me before moving to college. All of my friends dropped me and are now his best friend and constantly post pictures with him. Me and my ex are still friends with benefits but he says he wants to end things every time he comes over and its draining and tiring and I just want him to be my boyfriend again.

I am also currently in the process of pressing charges against my dad for sexual assault and it has been a very hard and long process, and I'm starting to feel guilty and for some weird reason I miss my dad. I feel like an absolute fucking idiot

I feel worthless and like nothing I ever do is the right thing and even my new friends I've made at college I'm starting to distance myself from because I know in the end I wills somehow hurt them. I am always the problem somehow and everything I touch turned to stone and bad things follow me.

"I'm tired of trying to live I never felt like my life ""began"". I have, until the start of summer, tried to work as hard as my mental energy has allowed to make my life start. I tried to study, I tried to date, I tried to have a job, I tried to have friends, I tried to find something I could start as a hobby, I tried to make myself more beautiful, I lost weight, I tried to get into exercise, I tried to be responsible with money... But all my tries in anything have failed, none of my effort has stuck, I have nothing but debt and bad memories to show of my past.

I don't understand how people just have so much energy and mental endurance to go trough life. I have tried and tried, but I just cannot keep up anything positive I try, or anything I achieve gets totally wiped out and destroyed in less than a year.

I always, always have felt like I have so much catching up to do and so much just basic life skills and experiences that I need to do, before I even reach the ""baseline"" and could actually start to enjoy being alive. I have NEVER been happy. If there is one thing that seems to be going well for a while, there are ten other aspects of my life that are going all wrong, making me sad and draining all my energy and whatever little tiny bit of satisfaction I get from anything.

I have tried so fucking hard. I haven't done as much as other people, and I haven't made the best desicions. But I have given all I have in me. I feel like I'm playing life with half of the cards everyone else has dealt with. I don't know why I have so little energy, endurance, self-confidence, but I have tried to put all of the little I do have into life. I have started over from a clean slate so many times, every time believing that ""this is the time it pays off! Now I'm older and smarter and won't do the same mistakes all over again!"" And it never pays off.

I always end up suffering from my lack of past life. I have no confidence in myself, and I especially hate how I look. I end up doing similar mistakes than in my past, or just whooole new and more fucked up mistakes. And life always has some new tricks to fuck me over.

I feel like I have never time to fix one mess before life throws new shit in the mix. I barely have enough in me to go through completely normal, disaster-free life, and then I'm supposed to ALSO have the capacity to deal with every new problem that the universe throws at me? While also trying to improve myself and my life somehow? Fuck that.

It feels like I have _just enough_ in me to keep myself afloat, and then the universe throws bricks at me, all the while everyone else is telling me to just swim ashore and build a house! ""Start a new hobby! Do exercise! See friends! Go to events! Buy the clothes you like! Move to a new apartment! Start dating! Break up! Get pets! Go back to school! You can achieve anything you put you mind to, honey!""

And nobody believes me when I sincerely tell them that I can't. I don't have it in me, I don't have enough money, I dont have enough time, I don't have enough confidence, and I simply, just do not have enough energy.

If I go to work, and then go buy groceries, and eat and shower and sleep, I maybe on a good day have enough energy to do one thing. If I clean, that's it. If I go for a walk, that's it. If I go out, that's it. If I watch a movie, that's it. Other people feel so superhuman to me. I had coworkers who had gone to the gym in the morning, then school, then went to their hobby, then came to work, then went out to see their friends, then cooked and did self care and cleaned and studied and watched a movie, all in one day? Every day? That feels absolutely impossible.

And THOSE PEOPLE have the audacity to tell ME that I don't do enough. But for them life and living is just that, living. For me every single fucking little thing I do is a concious choice, it takes time and energy and planning and so much mental capacity. I don't just do things, I have to actively, conciously do them, every second of the way. It drains me, and I just can't. Not anymore. I have tried so hard, tried so many things, but I don't want to torture myself anymore.

And the people who don't understand me get angry and disappointed in me, like I have given up on a minor inconvinience. Like I decided to jump off a bridge because I stubbed my toe. But for me my entire life has been like stubbing my toe, over and over again, every second of the day. And that's just ""baseline"". I refuse to live anymore for others, because they don't understand me, and see some silver lining for me ""in the future"". All they talk about is the future.

Everyone always tells me that ""its gonna get better in the future! You just have to get over this hard spot in your life and then you will be happy again and it will be all worth it!"" How can I get over a hard spot in my life when that is all my life has ever been? How can I be happy again and enjoy life when I haven't ever experienced it in 26 years? How's it going to get better when it was never better? How's it going to be all worth it, when anything else before has never been worth it?

All I see in the future is the same suffering I have dealt with to this day. It just goes on and on, situtations change, I change, people around me change, but the suffering is the only constant.

It's not like I wouldn't want to have a future. I have always wanted a future, a life worth living, a body worth having, and happiness. I have hopes and dreams and goals and things I want to do and so much love to give.  Of fucking course I would want to want to live. But life has never given anything back to me. Every time I have a moment of happiness, relief, satisfaction, you name it, life always takes it back with interest.

I just cannot keep giving up effort and time and money and love and energy and effort anymore. I know life isn't easy, but I just have nothing left to give. I have given my share, I have tried, I've asked for help, but if nothing pays off then I refuse to give any more of myself to the universe. The universe doesn't want me here, and has proven it to me, and now I believe it.

I'm not giving up. I'm just refusing to give anymore. I want peace, and I want nothingness. No more pain, no more memories, no more worries, no more effort. I have given my share, and I'm ready to become dust once again.",depression

"I'm stuck with a depressive person, how can I get rid of them? For over a decade, I’ve been supporting my mom and her boyfriend. They live with me rent-free, and I cover all the bills. It worked well for a long time, but things changed about three years ago when my mom's boyfriend started complaining about being “bored.” I encouraged him to find a new hobby, join a community group, volunteer, or anything that would give him purpose without costing much. But nothing changed—just endless hours of watching TV, which only fuels his unhappiness.

Recently, he visited his daughter in a larger city for a weekend, and he came back overjoyed about how ""amazing"" it was compared to what he views as a “boring” city here. His comments made me feel terrible, as though I’m somehow responsible for his boredom. I tried speaking with his daughter about potentially having him stay with her part-time, but she avoided the topic. When she did take him for that weekend, she dropped him back off much earlier than agreed. He also has two other sons, one of whom doesn’t speak to him, while the other has been promising to take him in for years, though it’s always been an empty promise.

Adding to the strain, my mom recently confided in me that she's extremely unhappy and wants to end the relationship. However, she feels trapped because breaking up could hurt her relationship with her own mother, which she fears would affect her inheritance. She feels she has no choice but to stay, as they have no income otherwise.

I’m at a complete loss and feeling increasingly depressed. Moving isn’t an option, as I need to stay in the area for work and my daughter’s school. I can’t just ask them to leave, as they have nowhere else to go. I feel stuck, and it’s hardening me against the idea of helping others in the future. Despite everything I’ve done, his children have never acknowledged or thanked me for taking care of him. In fact, they criticize where I live and make me feel like I’ve trapped them “in my basement.”

I managed to get them onto the government housing list, but the wait is projected to be 8-10 years. I’m not sure I can handle another year of this situation. Any advice would be deeply appreciated—I’m open to trying anything at this point.",depression

"depression is ruining my life i don’t even know where to start, i feel like this is going to be a bit rambley so apologizes in advance. 

i’m currently in my third year of university, studying environmental science. it is something i am so passionate about and love learning but i’ve fallen into a depression recently and i can’t even will myself to do anything at all. i am so frustrated at it because i want to succeed and i want to do good and have the energy to put in but i am not able to when most of my energy is going into trying not to kill myself.

i go to counseling every other week and have made major improvements in my mental health overall, depression episodes like this are uncommon for me. it has just been so hard lately and i’m struggling with my physical health, mental health, and a tough situation regarding my love life all at once. i thought i could handle the new school year regardless of all this because i’ve handled worse but my grades are really bad and it makes me feel so stupid and i ask myself why do i even bother. i feel like i’ll never get to where i want to go because i’m always gonna have this shitty roadblock in the way regardless of how i navigate around it.

another thing making it hard is i feel like people don’t really understand. i still live with my parents who know about my mental health issues and my chronic illnesses and yet i get yelled at and talked down to when i can’t bring the dishes out of my room, but when i tell them i’m busy with school and work and i’m also very depressed it falls on deaf ears. i talk to my friends about my problems but they don’t offer me what i need, they try to make me see it from other perspectives and play devils advocate which isn’t a bad thing but i just want my feelings validated and i don’t want to hear someone fight back on my thoughts and feelings and opinions. 

i just feel so alone and it reminds me of being 13 and feeling like the only one struggling again which adds onto the depression i’m going through. i want to feel okay again and do good in school and actually enjoy learning about things. i want to be able to retain any information and not have the worst brain fog and be able to think about what i’m learning and not constantly talking myself off a ledge. i’m tired and it’s hard and i don’t want to give up but sometimes it feels like the only choice.",depression

I don't know, I'm just unhappy and feel stuck, tired, and too reliant on uppers that barely get me through...tired of dreading my work days to pay bills and have health insurance for a life that really isn't that great lol",depression
"I want to be normal again I realized at the start of my sophomore semester in university that I was having way more suicidal thoughts than normal. I also realized that I couldn't push myself to do things even if it was stuff I enjoyed. So I got checked out with a psychiatrist that my school partners with and she told me that I have major depression disorder, generalization anxiety, and a monitor for panic disorders. Hearing those words come out of her mouth was a shocker. Major depression? Anxiety? Panic disorders? I got put with a counselor who I have been going once a week for the four weeks and honestly, I feel like nothing has changed. Hell if anything, she told me I might have some personality disorder and that shit scares me because I just want to be how I was before. I just want to go back to normal. I want to be able to push myself like I was able to back then. I want the old me back. I'm tired of these degrading thoughts that won't go away. How do you make them go away? It takes me two hours and thirty minutes to just go to school and I can't push myself to keep going, no matter how much I know it's important. I lack in my homework and instead go on the game KNOWING I have to do work. My room was a total mess just until recently I picked it up but I don't even know what I am saying anymore! God I just want to be normal. I want to be happy again. I want to be normal.",depression
"I Feel Envious of Death Row Inmates Today, I watched a video from a channel that specializes in explaining the laws in Vietnam. The video detailed the process for prisoners who have committed the most heinous crimes and are sentenced to death, referred to as “the worst punishment”. They described the death sentence as follows:

1. The prisoner is allowed to have a large, delicious meal of their choosing before execution.
2. The execution involves the administration of three injections:
   - The first injection numbs any feeling, ensuring the prisoner experiences no pain.
   - The second injection paralyzes the body to prevent any resistance to the final shot.
   - The third injection introduces a chemical that stops the heart, resulting in death without pain due to the effect of the first injection.

The aim is to allow the prisoner to die a painless death.

Meanwhile, I read other news stories about people who attempted suicide by jumping from high buildings. Unfortunately, many survive with severe, lifelong injuries such as broken ribs and damaged organs, yet they still have to continue living in pain.

This seems incredibly unfair to me. It almost feels as though our system is encouraging criminal acts by offering criminals a way to escape through a painless death. 

Why must good people who wish for death to escape their deep suffering be forced to continue living with excruciating injuries and chronic pain, while those who commit serious crimes are granted a painless end? This paradox makes me wonder if our system values people’s lives only to enslave them as laborers.",depression

"Unable to function in work, clueless about what to do and terrified of being broke. I've been working as a senior analyst for the past year but I've recently handed my notice in. I'd say it's been a rough year for my mental health, with surviving a suicide attempt and multiple visits to the crisis team, but honestly last year wasn't much better.

Work-wise, I enjoy analysis, but my ability to concentrate, motivate myself, absorb myself in work etc is woefully inconsistent. Sometimes simple tasks are so overwhelming I just do absolutely nothing and stare at the screen, or do anything I can to avoid them. Sometimes I'm great, full of energy and rediscovering why I love my field of work.

Circumstances with my particular role & associated stress meant that I've handed my notice in without anywhere else to go. I'm applying for jobs where I can just submit my CV and don't have to put any more effort in, because I honestly don't know what the right thing to do is and the effort of really TRYING with an application doesn't seem worth it.

I've got £8,000 in credit card debt, a car on finance, a washing machine and a laptop on finance. I share a tenancy with a friend, and frankly will never find a property this good/cheap again if I lose it. I can move back in with my mother and put my stuff in storage, like I did when I was 27, but I'm 34 now and living back with my mum isn't likely to make me feel great about myself.

Do I look for a low stress job, something less mentally taxing, maybe something not in an office, but take a huge paycut and risk moving back home?

Do I take some time out of work entirely to recover, and move back in with my mum, risking the social/self-esteem penalties and leaving my housemate in the lurch?

Do I try and find another role in my field, but less senior, and try and work on my mental health in the background as I have been doing, but risk imploding entirely?

I'm at a loss, and the longer I struggle to find a path, the more urgent the situation becomes.

Does anyone have any recommendations for resources that could help? I'm UK based.",depression
"I wake up everyday day feeling empty and depressed  I hate that I even asked my ex for emotional availability and more affection because I’m assuming he became less attracted to me and really didn’t want me anymore, so now I’m lonely again. I’m so lonely and it’s so cruel. Over 334 million people in the US and I’m lonely. Can’t find not one fucking person. It’s so hard. I find it hard even being compatible with people because I don’t fit the status quo and I’m not religious anymore. When your beliefs change over the years, it becomes harder to connect with people without hiding your true self and I don’t want to hide myself. I just don’t want to be here. I wake up with heaviness in my tummy and chest every day and this is so cruel. The only thing I have is walking trails, working out (I’m still obese) and studying STEM for fun, oh and watching stuff. Other than that, I’m so alone. I should get a cat or dog. But then, I’ll get attached and feel bad when I get SI, which is literally every day. Does it ever get better? Like if I lose weight, will I find people? Will it be shallow since most humans highly value the way the body looks? I hate it here. Shallowness makes me angry and depressed too. Like I literally don’t belong to any society. It doesn’t get better right? ",depression

"Suicidal GF My girlfriend and I are long distance,. She has a lot of problems with her mental health and managing her emotions.

I just got off a video call, and she was saying things like ""I shouldn't be here/ this needs to end/ I'm tired/ I'm done/ why is my life like this""
Shes financially struggling, has no self confidence,  lives with abusive (physically and mentally) parents. 

She was crying and talking to me alot, then all of a sudden stops, acts really happy and starts smiling at me saying ""you will be ok"". She will then stare into space for 10-30 sec. Then I ask if she's OK, then she just smiles and says ""I'm ok, why do you think I'm not ok?"" 

I'm not sure how to read her and it's worrying me. I know she's attempted in the past, but I do t have a lot of experience with the last signs of when somebody is finally done/gives up.

What can I do to help? I'm trying my best but her mental state has been declining over the last few months, I don't know what to do.",depression
"I feel like I should just give up I'll start by saying that I had several interests in women (4 at least) & all of them have bf's already, which completely destroyed me but also, I can't seem to engage with any of them bc I'm too anti social & introverted, I've successfully gotten to know 1 of the girls, but she doesn't text me or hangout much (unless she's tutoring me) & I think I'm losing interest in her (& the rest) but I'm upset with this because it's already too difficult for me to become interested in others romantically bc my personal issues & experiences, but I can't do anything about it. Im scared that I'll never become interested in others again & that I'll be alone forever because I can't seem to fix my issues with my mental health or become the ""best version"" of myself no matter what I seem to do, I think giving up & accepting my sad reality might be the best option I have bc of my situation, the girl that's tutoring me is really cute, similar interests & values as me & a lot more! But, I feel my interest fading because she doesn't text me enough & only hang out when she tutors me, i don't want to lose my interest but can't really do anything to keep it, & if I do lose my interest, I might as well just close my heart off completely since no one seems like me at all (not even myself) nor can I become interested in others that much at all either. I feel like giving up is the best option possible now, seeing how I can't ever find anyone to like me or like back or even become the best version of myself to even be worthy of love or even considered to be ""ready"" for it either.
And no amount of self improvement or efforts or help seems to work either, therapy, self enjoyment, friends & family, nothing seems to truly help me be happy either. 
My self improvement is nonexistent bc all my efforts did nothing, my ocd is going out of control, my too fat & ugly, & I feel like a waste of space, time, money & effort to even exist.
No one should like me bc I can't even like myself at all, I feel like I shouldn't have been born & someone else should just take my place bc I guarantee that someone ELSE would be able to have a fulfilling & happy life & actually deserve this life I was given than me.

I just feel like I'm not meant to be loved by anyone (including friends & family) or even be given chances for life at all & should just fade away like I never existed, seems like the best option I have but I'm too much of a coward to go through with it either, so I guess I'm stuck here until something or someone brings my long awaited & very much wanted demise.",depression
"I finally realized what I'm good at Completely fucking up everything. It's an incredible skill where I think ""I'm gonna fuck this up"" and then I do. A lot of times I just do it without thinking about it. It's amazing how much I can fuck up

Last night I didn't know what I was feeling. Depression, happiness I don't know. It was so bad I wanted to die. I've been being told that my behaviors are normal, but they don't feel normal because they drive me to snap, want to snap, or self harm. I've made a post about it before. I feel like I'm being betrayed or like people don't care about me anymore and then get so angry or depressed. It's stressing me out so badly. I just want everything to go away and to dissappear.

"I feel I'm almost at my breaking point. Hello people of Reddit. This is my first time writing in this subreddit so I don't know how to write these stuff. I just found it urgent to write this stuff here before I do anything stupid. To anyone who stumbles upon this post wondering why am I writing this? I just wanted to vent about stuff that has been happening to me In the past few years.

  
First of all, I have suicidal thoughts. Now I don't want to die, but life recently has given me so much shit that I can't take it anymore. I'm 25 years old I'm failing Uni, I don't have a job, nothing pleases me, I have a failing relationship, my mother is battling cancer. Everything is SHIT. I just want to grab a gun and put a bullet in my head. But somehow I don't know, I keep on living. I think I'm doing it for others especially for my mother. I don't want to bring her more sorrow than she already has.

  
Secondly, I compare my self a lot to others, especially my girlfriend. All my friends and my girlfriend have all finished uni, they either have jobs or they are doing a masters degree, and I'm the only one doesn't have a clue who am I, what the fuck I want to do and what is my purpose. I am Tired. My girlfriend is getting tired of my shit and tbh, I don't blame her. I would be tired of my shit to.

  
Finally my situation with my girlfriend is not improving. Now I love her and I know she loves me to. We get into fights regularly over dumb shit and she told me that she loves me but she can't continue living like this. She tried helping me many times. She is the one that even encouraged me to go to therapy. But I'm not improving and she is kind of getting tired of this situation. I don't want to break up with her It would damage me more than I already am.

  
To anyone reading this. This is a cry of help. I am in a desperate situation and I need guidance before it's to late. Thank you!",depression

Anytime anything goes wrong - I spill some water, I don't do well in class, I say something awkward - I get genuinely horrible, violent, active suicidal thoughts and I hate them.

"Bylo za komunismu psychicky lépe než nyní?  Já jsem komunismus nezažil protože mi je 27 ale slyšel jsem že za komunismu sice nebylo moc hmotných věcí a bylo všeho nedostatek a díky tomu bylo psychicky líp. 

Řekla mi to babička která nějak komunismus neuznává ale dřív se lidi víc smáli, byli k sobě více otevření a měli radost i z maličkostí.. 

Když si to tak vezmu teoreticky tak něco na tom bude.. Žijeme v době kdy máme všude strašně moc elektroniky, internetu, jídla a jiného stimulu a mozek je z toho strašně moc přesycený až to vytvřáří spíš negativní hodnoty.. 

Jakto že je v dnešní době mnohem víc mladých co mají deprese a nešťastných lidí než údajně v komunismu když se žilo poměrně v restritkní chudobě? 

Určitě nechci zastávat režim ale zajímalo by mě jaká dříve byla doba a jaký to bylo co se týče mezilidských vztahů a psychické pohody.. 

Může se někdo kdo zažil komunismus podělit a vysvětlit proč tomu tak bylo?? 

Určitě na tom muselo být něco vzrušujícího černý trhy, tajný párty a tak.. Někdo řekne že bylo udavačství ale to je i v dnešní době a ještě mnohem horší než předtím podle mě.. Zkrátka mi přijde že dříve byli lidi víc při sobě a vážili si maličkostí a to dělalo tu větší radost ze života než v dnešní době.. ",depression
"Numb I Guess 
I feel numb. I hate my job. My relationship with my husband feels like it's falling apart. I think I'm a bad mom to our 4 year old.

I took the day off weeks ago to spend time with him at his company event but he could care less. In fact it would be better spent without me and he did go without me. Didn't even ask if I would/could go.. my feelings are hurt. This is the 2nd thing I've begged to attend with him out with his coworkers... I've never met them in the 4 years he has worked there. 

While I'm not a people person I long for adult interaction and a sense of belonging or community... I don't understand why he wouldn't be excited and more willing for me to come along... 

Has something changed? I know I'm not the best person/wife/friend he could have.. I saw him actively watching a music video keeping eyes on the main girl singing and dancing in a very skimpy outfit. I was in the room trying to sleep and could see him fover her up then remove the page blockjng her view as if he was trying to hide it from me? ....Am I overreacting? He hasn't been giving me hugs or kissing for a week or so... When I was down yesterday he started to ask questions and then became slightly affectionate. Do I even want that? It doesn't feel genuine. I think he longs for something else. 

To be honest he deserves it. I have never been a great companion in the past and I think he feels something missing now. He deserves someone better. I don't want to be here anymore.

Hi I am done with my 🧬 I hate myself ,depression
"How can I support my depressed boyfriend? My (27F) boyfriend (27M) has struggled with high functioning depression for the past several months pertaining to his career (and possibly other things). He recently took a new job that pays over $120k a year and relocated to a city a couple of hours away. Since he got there, his personality, mood, energy, and social battery have plummeted drastically. 

As some extra info, I'll be moving to be with him in 6 months. 

About 6 or 7 months before he left, I noticed he was becoming a lot less interested in what usually makes him happy. He stopped doing a lot of the little things for me, checking in, calling me on his lunch breaks, etc. He also started spending a lot of time on the couch at night doom scrolling or listening to leadership podcasts until 3 am. 

My boyfriend is usually very vibrant and happy. He's the funniest and silliest person I've ever met. 

Since he moved, he's been very irritable and hyper-focused on work. He's still working out and doing his best to take care of himself. I know a lot of people on the outside would question if he actually is depressed. 

I know him very well, and I see it, and am worried about him. 

He barely talks to me, his family, or the couple of friends that he has. 

At first, the lack of communication led my mind to wonder if he was cheating on me/losing interest in our relationship. We've had several conversations and I've given him multiple outs, and he seemed very hurt/offended by that. He says he still sees a future with me and comes to see me once a week. We'll also see each other more during the holidays. 

He's mentioned feeling hopeless multiple times, and has been completely shut down. He hasn't spoken to me in almost 24 hours, despite my attempts to reach out.

I asked him if he's willing to go to therapy and he said yes, but hasn't taken any steps to do that yet. I know that's difficult when you're struggling.

His symptoms: 

• Very irritable, quick to anger, less willing to find solutions 
• Barely speaking to me or his family (I'm close with his step mom)
• Deeply focused on success within his career and is extremely hard on himself about it 
• Not in tune with his emotions, shuts down completely when I talk about mine 
• His voice the past couple of times we've talked on the phone has been very quiet. He's 6'7 and usually has a very loud, deep voice. 
• Less interested in what's going on in my life, not asking about our cat that he adores
• Not responding to flirty/s*xual innuendos, indicating lack of s*x drive 
• Isolating me from his whereabouts/what he's up to 
• Not taking or rushing calls, very slow to respond to texts, little interest in conversations
• There's probably more that I don't see because I'm not with him physically.

He's coming to see me tomorrow. How should I go about talking to him? I support him and want to be here for him. I'm doing my best to be as gentle as I can, but this is deeply affecting me, too. ",depression

"Advice To Fight Depression During The Holiday Season? Hey everyone. I’m know I’m not a special case, as many of us have this feeling during this time of the year, but I need some help…

For me, this time of year is all about family, is it not? Watching everyone come together and embrace the holiday spirit reminds me how many of us feel disconnected from our loved ones, whether it be due to living from a distance or past conflicts that leaves. While I believe this season offers a wonderful opportunity to reunite and appreciate life’s joys, for some, it can feel out of reach.

This time of year also really makes me reflect on my childhood and how much I’ve grown. Even though I’m only twenty-two years old and many folks have told that there’s plenty ahead in my life, I can’t help but look back at my youthful years and think, “Wow, life was so much more fun and carefree then!” For example, I recently found some Nickelodeon Christmas specials on YouTube that I used to watch as a kid, and it hit me how quickly almost fifteen years have flown by since those days.

What do you guys recommend? How should I overcome this feeling of dread? I do apologize if I may sound bitter, and I know this is only a seasonal occurrence, but any advice would be greatly appreciated.",depression

I feel like I'm meant to fail and i should just give up soon I got diagnosed with major depressive disorder and social anxiety disorder when i was 13 i've tried getting help from professionals but i'm doing just as bad now as i was back then (i am 19 now) the anxiety just ended up getting worse to the point i can barely drive a car anymore without having a panic attack. I don't feel connected to anyone. at least not as much as i feel like i should be. there is no family member or friend who i feel like i am close enough to for me to talk about my feelings with them. it honestly feels like i've never had a deep connection with anyone in my entire life. the only time i ever opened up was because i just couldn't hold it in anymore. that was the one time i showed someone how i was truly feeling and they hated me for it. a few weeks after that i tried killing myself. i didn't die and my family looked disgusted by the idea that i would even try it. i've hidden all of my feelings since then. every time i've ever tried opening up to anyone about anything its only made things worse for me. but i cant handle being like this anymore. The most at peace i ever felt in my life was before i tried to end it last time. i want to feel like that again im sorry im so weak ,depression
"This is the story of my recovery and slow realisation that i have never really recovered Before I start my story, I would like to preface that I will never end my life. I am too much of a coward to do so, and I love the people around me enough to know I could never do something so cruel towards them.

I am an extroverted person. I have always loved the company of people, always craved the attention and love I received. I wanted more, more friends, more love. More everything. So i could never feel this emptiness ever again.

When I was younger, I was severely bullied by multiple groups of girls I considered my friends. I was sexually harassed by a group of my friends, and when I pushed them away and they fell, they decided to get all the girls in my tuition group  to boycott me. They never talked to me for months. I had never felt so empty. Simultaneously, I was excluded from my class friend group, who apologised to me a year after graduation, though we are no longer in touch, and i was naive enough to accept their apology in the first place. The worst one was when the girl I loved the most in the entire world, my best friend, said she no longer wanted to be friends with me, but she couldn’t because I would kill myself without her.

I broke off contact the moment I heard her say that.

I was a suicidal child, I would constantly self harm and think of offing myself. I would cut myself anywhere, everywhere. I don’t remember why I did, I just remember the pain on my arms and wrist feeling much more pleasurable than the pain in my head.

I was physically assaulted by a friend. She knew I cut myself, she knew my parents found out, she knew I stopped. She used a blade to slice my arm repeatedly, while I just allowed her to do so.

Why did I? A part of me was scared and didn’t know what to do. A part of me wanted to feel that pain again. The pleasure. The ecstasy.

My parents found out shortly after. And was angry that I was cutting myself again. I pleaded, claiming I wasn’t the one that did it, till this day, I still think they don’t believe me because I never told who did it do me.

I wonder how that girl is doing now, I hope she’s doing horribly.

I started healing, I became somewhat popular in high school, I managed to gain many friends, people who adored me, loved me. Gosh, I would kill for that feeling again, to be loved. Sometimes friendships break off, it’s slow, and it’s mutual, but it doesn’t leave a bad taste in your mouth. It just happens. But everytime it happens, why do I feel horrible? I want you again, I want you to talk to me, to love me, to give me love and attention.

I don’t know who I am. I learned to mask my true self. The girls when I was younger hated the real me, despised that person, so who am I but someone to oblige? If you want someone else, someone more pleasurable. I will give you exactly that. Someone happy, laid back, someone fun, someone that isn’t afraid to speak their mind but is also kind. Someone that frolics to your feet and does everything you want me to do. But also someone that is independent, someone that speaks their mind, someone that is not me.

I hate myself. I truly hate myself. The stupid solemn person behind that facade. The utterly depressive and constantly upset person that cries themselves to sleep at night. The person that wants you to love me yet even after all that hard work you still never do. Why is that so? Is it how I look? How i dress? How I talk? What is it? What do you want me to change? Please love me. Please.

Even now, my life is somewhat perfect, isn’t it? So why am I still so ungrateful? Why does my body physically hurt when my emotions get too strong? Why do I always feel like everyone around me secretly despises me? Do all my friends want me dead? Are my parents disappointed in me? I’m so confused and scared. Please, someone guide me, won’t you?

I realised too late that my biggest enemy was myself. Loving someone scares me. I feel like because I was never loved, that I can’t love someone myself(or in this case, my own person). The thought of happiness, genuinely terrifies me to my core. I can’t deal with that. I’m not strong enough to be happy yet alone want to be happy. That’s just how my nature is. I hate myself so much I feel like I don’t deserve that feeling, I can chase it all I want, but it will never come. I will forever feel insecure and hateful about myself because I don’t want to heal, truly, I want to stay this way. I will always find something to be angry about, I will always nitpick things I don’t like again myself, then hide it all again, because I’m scared of vulnerability, I scared of being that weak little child again.

I need to lie, I need to hide behind the person people think I am. I have lied so much, the lies kept piling and piling, my person is no longer myself to the point where I don’t know if the facade is the real me that I want to deny, or truly someone completely. When I hear my name, I disassociate, I think of them as the facade, not me. What is happening? This is stupid, even now, I’m just rambling.

 Why are humans so cruel? What happened to kindness? Will I always be the one that’ll have to be kind instead? Even then, because of my lack of vulnerability shown, people think I’m cold and distant instead, god. I hate this. Please just tell me what you think of me. Of that person, how I can improve on it. I feel sick, disgusted at myself, and at them.

The things that I love, my interests are the only things stoping me from doing anything stupid and rash right now. Drawing and reading really helps calm me down, but my university entrance exams are in two months, and my whole life depends on it. I should be studying instead, but I’m so depressed and fucked in the head, I constantly need something to distract me from my inner turmoil.

I feel like icarus. I flew too close to the sun, I decided to become someone else to be loved, and now I’m being burnt, I don’t know who I am. I hate myself, the facade and whoever I truly am. This sounds so freaking corny, gosh, I will hate everything I do.

I want to change. I want to be a better person so that I can stand by the people that I love. I want to catch up to my peers, I want to learn to love not only myself but other people as well. I want to be filled with love again, not hate.

"14 and done with everything  I recently started high-school 3 months back and every day since the first month has been pure torture. Teachers and my parents constantly expecting me to give it 100% when I'm just too burned out to do anything. I have horrible anxiety and am constantly second guessing every single interaction I have with my classmates. I'll have a nice conversation and then the voice in my head will say ""they hate you"" or ""they think your dumb and are just being nice becuase they feel bad for you"" it's exhausting. I almost got in a fight with a kid becuase i thought he was trying to make fun of me.  It doesn't help that all of my hobbies that I usually use to distress aren't working anymore. I've missed almost 3-4.5 days of school just this month and my mom says I can't miss any more which stresses me our because  I burn out so fast now. We're going to see my psych Thursday which means that she's going  to change my medicine to ""fix"" the problem which will most likely stop working eventually and my depression will just come right back. Recently I've been leaving in the middle of class just to self harm (ie lunch myself In the head) which my mom told me to stop doing which is stressful bechaee it's one of the only coping methods I have left even if it's a bad one. I wish I had the courage to just get it over with and overdose already but i don't have access to anything like that which is good for me apparently as I'm supposed to just suffer through this for the rest of my life until I die alone.

"A letter to my therapist  Every session we sit and talk about all the ways I can improve my life, to make me less anxious, to identify negative patterns of thought, to try and make the best of everyday, and every session I tell you about something I achieved, but what I don’t tell you is all the ways I failed, and in my journey that’s all I can feel. I don’t tell you about how six out of the seven days I could barely convince myself to get out of bed. How every morning I wake up and go back to sleep hoping to wake up feeling like I’m worth something. I never thought I’d make it to 20. I don’t have plans for the future. I’m 2 years into university and I’m dropping out because I’m failing half my classes. I don’t have the motivation to study and I barely go to class, and the worst part? No one even notices, because if life has thought me anything it’s to be a good liar. I tried, for my parents, for my friends who are all succeeding in their degrees, for you, I tried for everyone but myself, because is it even worth it? I see the world burning down around me, it doesn’t feel like a place for someone like me. Too sensitive, too needy, too scared, too different. I wake up every day feeling sick, like there’s cotton in my head, the pills help, but sometimes I can’t tell if they even do. I’m scared, you say I don’t have to do this alone, but I do. Because I’m the problem, my inaction, my lack of motivation, my depression. I always feel like I’m pretending, pretending to be okay, pretending to be productive, pretending to be happy and sometimes I even believe it, but I always wake up the next morning back in my self destructive cycle. I used to think if I could just finish high school it would get better, if I could just stop sharing a room with my sister it would get better, if I could just get help it would get better, but it hasn’t.

"Is there any point anymore? I’m 29, I’ll be 30 in March and I’m just so exhausted mentally, physically and emotionally.

I cannot seem to find love anywhere I’ve been rejected every time I try, not a year has gone by where I haven’t been heartbroken.

At what point should I just give up? Obviously ages ago but idk I need confirmation from someone else that it’s time for me to just throw in the towel and accept that I’m going to die alone.

The failure this time you ask? A coworker, we flirted, joked, they called me cutie, said how lovely I was. We have so much in common but suddenly they messaged to say that we can’t be anymore than friends. 

Devastated I turned back to manifesting and affirmations. I robotically did this for hours, trying to convince myself that no matter what the real world was showing me, that I had the power to change it, that if I just waited and affirmed and thought positively that we’d work it out. Others said that affirmations and the law of attraction just makes you “shift realities” and puts you where you want to be’ I repeated affirmations and manifested and meditated whenever I remembered. I mentally, spiritually and physically exhausted myself and today they came back and reiterated that we won’t be more than friends.

I just feel so lost right now, I feel like I’m being strangled. I feel like the world is playing a cruel joke on me. It’s actually hilarious to think that I had the audacity to think “hey, maybe it’ll be different this time, maybe they’ll like me back this time.” Not a year goes by where I don’t get rejected in some way. I’m a mess of emotions, I’m a mess of a person. My head is working in overdrive trying to pinpoint what I did to deserve this be it in this life or another. I’m reminded of when a former fwb told me that nobody else would want me. At the time I used that as a reason to cut myself off from him, called him “toxic” and “horrible” cause I foolishly believed that I deserved better but now I realise that he was right. 

I’m not meant to find the love I want, I’m not sure what my place in life is yet but I know that my standards need to be lowered, that I need to stop expecting good for myself.

I’m giving myself two weeks. If I still feel this hopeless after two weeks then idk. I’m not actively making any plans to take my own life but it’s definitely on my mind and I’m not exactly doing much to keep myself alive ",depression
magnesium l-threonate Does anyone know any brands that are gummies or are u able to open up the capsules. Magnesium glycinate makes me itchy really bad I have to take a zertec when I take one and I can’t even take it every night cus then the zertec don’t work then I can’t sleep cus I’m so itchy. I’m sensitive to supplents I don’t asorb stuff well. A example is b12 if I take the non bio active form it just floats in my blood and then I’m itchy and it’s way to high. I do have the MTHR mutation also. So I wanna try magnesium l-threonate since it’s easily asorbed so I don’t have to worry about extra levels floating around since my body doesn’t pee them out. I have been depressed lately and magnesium glycinate helps but it makes me so itchy :(((. The magnesium threonate capsules are so big no way I can swallow that I don’t understand why they don’t come in gummies. The only one I found barely has any reviews on Amazon so I don’t know if the company is good or not. Life extension on Amazon has a lot of complaints and the powder only comes 1/4 full u get way less for same price. For the life extension capsules can I open them and put them in water or do I need to put it in peanut butter??

"I am tired with this family of mine  I am 19M, a college student in 2nd year(the college has a good reputation), I am doing well in studies and will likely (hopefully) land a job by next year. This is all good, I can handle the struggle and war of mine, but I just don't fucking understand how do I deal with my family members. 

Let's start with my sister (older), opposite to my academic career, her career went absolute downfall, she and my father has a REALLY REALLY REALLY (yes three times) BAD RELATIONSHIP, she just refuses to talk, and when my father comes forward and tries to talk with her, she goes all red, starts throwing stuff around, calling all sorts of abuses, even starts crying and screaming.  We keep giving her opportunities to do something in her life, I always keep advising her on how to study this and that, how she can stay in discipline etc. We have good internet, enough money, and opportunities, but she is like NO.

this has fucking resulted in so many fights in last 5 yrs, I have lost count. Here I am trying to start learning something new, that lets learn new tech, and BOOM, she starts her show. 


let's talk about my mother and father now, My father is supportive towards me, since I got in a good college and all, tells me that I am the very reason he can show his face around in the society, BUT on small minor things my parents start fighting like hell, trust me it's NOT GREAT AT ALL


WHEN THEY SHOUT AND FIGHT, my heart feels like sinking, I feel like somebody please fucking take me away from here, just kill me or anyone else, stop this misery already, I have had enough of this crap, I just want to earn some fucking money and run away from this hell hole. 

The reason for fights are, ofc related to my sister (mainly) and then some OTHER things like, we went to hometown via airplane 2 months, and mother somehow lost all our boarding passes which father is demanding AFTER 2 months to gain some reimbursement, Now he is barking like a dog, I hate every second here. 


is it normal to have fights like this in family? is this normal to have fucked up fights? is it normal for a student growing up to experience this? did I grow too fucking spoiled? should I kill myself or anyone in my family? 

I don't think anyone can advice on this or even read this whole rambling I have written....

The reason for that screenshot is because, he will text me casually like a friend just checking in and he says he’ll be there for me too, but in my mind I feel: how are you so depressed you can’t be in a relationship with me, but can see yourself having the energy to be my “friend” instantaneously.

Now that I do, I just wanted to say how much I appreciate your guy's strength to go through that every single day, you guys are amazing.

As I've said, it's not something anyone around me seems to understand, nobody of my closest friends can truly understand the heaviness, the hopelessness, and how difficult and impossible the little things in life seemed to be now.

Nobody could understand me, because seemingly I don't have much bad happening to me, many people would want my life, but deep inside I'm on a constant swing of states between wanting to cry but can't and just crying from every little thing. I want to quit my job, move away to the woods and bury myself in bed. I feel like life is too much to deal with, I just want some peace.

Like I have never known a time that I didn't experience severe recurring depression so it's just fuckin crazy that these people are real? One even said they don't understand how people can be depressed for seemingly no reason. Like I wish so much I could say the same.


Like logically I knew they must exist but it's still just unfathomable in my mind. It kinda makes me sad that I don't understand them just as much as they don't understand me. But I'm glad at least someone is happy in life. Idk man.",depression
"I’ve wasted so much time being depressed, that I’m depressed about wasting time. I can’t imagine how many days I have wasted to being sad and crying and not being able to accomplish the things I need to do. I have responsibilities I have deadlines and none of them seem to matter when I am in these dark episodes. How can you force yourself to do what needs to be done when you feel so hopeless and numb?",depression

"I hate how people boast about how much they support mental illness then once they meet a mentally ill person they want nothing to do with them It's just so fucking tiresome. You see it everywhere on social media. People will go on and on and on about how we should all reach out to mentally ill people then when you have the courage to reach out to them the same fucking people will tell you bullshit like ""man up"", ""stop being so sensitive"", ""hey bro at least you're not a starving child in Africa"", ""bro it's just your mindset you gotta start thinking more positively"", and so on. Like what's the fucking point. Whenever we do reach out we either get scolded or our problems get dismissed. I'm not trying to say this is how it is for everyone but this is just from my experiences. 

I just want someone to fucking listen just once and for once I want to be able to tell someone about this without fear of eventually getting ghosted. Is that asking for too much?",depression

"Anyone keep switching from admitting to yourself that you have depression to invalidating yourself into thinking you were just playing victim? I know I have issues. But I go through manic mood swings, and while on the depressive end I feel like absolute shit, when I'm out of that phase and feel somewhat ""normal"" again I tell myself I greatly exaggerated the effect in my mind. It doesn't help that my self loathing won't let me admit that I have depression because I keep thinking I don't deserve to be depressed. So I invalidate myself and continue life until the next phase hits, and the cycle continues.",depression
"The worst part of the depression, is that feeling, deep deep down, that the reason you're depressed is because you want to be. It's just the thought, that maybe you know how to be happy. Maybe all the stuff you read online, the stuff your family tells you, the stuff you hear from your therapist, maybe it all goes somewhere in your head. Maybe you've seen enough happy, normal functioning people, that you have some idea of how to do what they do. That maybe you've made the same mistakes enough times that you could point them out and stop repeating them.

It's the idea that, you know how not to be depressed, so if you still are, then that means you must want it this way. And if you want it this way, well that must mean you deserve it.

And I guess, that's probably not true, but sometimes, sometimes I just don't know.",depression
Is anyone else strangely sick of being high functioning? I know that the fact that I can brush my teeth and shower each day and show up to work each day is a blessing with my depression. But I’m also sick of constantly feeling like I’m about to break. I hate nearly downing my pills each night only to wake up the next day to plaster a fake as smile on my face and go to work. Each night I think to myself I can’t go on like this and each day I do. Part of me just somehow wishes I completely gave up and just hit rock bottom. I don’t know. Anyone else feel the same?,depression
"Becoming a regular at a local coffee shop changed my life I was depressed, failing school, etc and I decided I should do my homework at a coffee shop one day. I went in and the owner was super nice and asked me if I wanted to join the rewards program and I was really craving community at this point and I was super excited. 
I kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me. I started to get to know everybody there very well and now I consider them all friends. 
I found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot, and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses.

""You have so much more time, things will get better!"" - Lot more time for things to get worse too :)

"I hate 'foggy brain syndrome' Does anyone else feel like their mind isn't as sharp as it used to be? Back when I was a kid, I was actually able to focus on things and had a pretty good memory. Now, it's like I'm on permanent autopilot. I rarely ever take note of my surroundings or have clear inner monologue. I'm always stuck in this half-awake state where I can't focus on multiple things at once and just kind of ""zone out"" so to speak. I also tend to forget things really quickly for some reason.

It makes me feel like some useless, brain-dead retard that can't even function normally or think basic thoughts. It's as if my cranium is rotting away or something. I'm stuck with permanent brain fog and there's nothing I can do about it. I take antidepressants and vitamin d pills, I drink lots of water, I eat healthy, but nothing works. 

I hate the fact that my brain will never work the same way again, all because of depression. It's destroying my life and I can't take it anymore.

Anything I do is to distract myself from my thoughts but I end up at the same dark place at the end of every day. Honestly feel like instead of growing as a person, I deteriorated in the last few years.

"Life doesn't ""get better"" unless you take actions to MAKE it better. But depression itself can make it impossible to act Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to ""be good for your mental health""... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.

I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.

If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.

It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.

More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?

"2 years since I dropped out of college due to anxiety and depression, I finally signed back up for classes yesterday. I finally did it guys!!!!! 2 years!! 

I was so depressed 2 years ago I started skipping classes, I failed every single class I was in. My GPA dropped to a 1.7. I lost my financial aid, which I couldn't go back the next semester without.

I spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because I couldn't afford to go back and I ruined my life over depression. 

But I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start.

Edit: I cant believe how many people replied to this!! Thank you all so much for encouraging me, to know I had 100+ people comment to tell me how proud they are makes me even more motivated to do well this semester.

"The worst part of depression is that it's stolen my personality My actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. 

Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.

"Depression = Losing intelligence The worst part about depression for me, even worse than suicidal thoughts or constant pain, is the huge toll it has on my mental faculties. 

I think slower. I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey.

I can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. 

I'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement. 

It has been like that for years, even worsening, I'm worried that I'll just stay ""depression stupid"" forever. It's also completely ruining my future, because I can't make any sound decisions.

"I (24 f) got dressed and did a bit of my makeup to meet up with a friend at a coffee shop. I’m in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn’t show up. This was my attempt to “reach out”. Update:

Sorry in advance, I’m on mobile and this is long. 
I really wasn’t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! 

I’d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.

Next I’d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn’t know I had. 

I also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn’t angry at her because I understand that she’s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I’ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! 

I’m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn’t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven’t dwelled on it too much. She’ll reach out when she’s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. 

I’ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven’t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what’s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I’m better off being out of that toxic environment but it’s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. 

I’m also struggling with my marriage. I’m a military spouse and it’s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won’t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it’s been traumatic and hard. I haven’t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I’m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. 

I also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn’t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn’t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. 

It just would’ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would’ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. 

It’s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. 
I also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!

TL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I’m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn’t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so.",depression

"We only wish depression was being ""sad"". But depression is much more than that. 

It’s the excuses you have to make when you can’t make that meeting. 

It’s the friends and family you’ve lost because you can’t explain why. 

It’s the opportunities that land in everyone else’s lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. 

It’s the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. 

It’s the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. 

It’s your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. 

It’s the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. 

It’s the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. 

It’s the wall that blocked you off from life. 

It's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories. 

It’s not just being “sad”. And we can only wish it was.

"I'm black, I'm scared, tired and I'm at the end of my rope with life. Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

Edit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words.

I never talk to anyone- just listen to my music and try to do whatever, but today this random girl asked me if I was doing okay because I looked more down than usual. i told her ‘im good - thanks though”! i knew I felt myself getting worse and I guess it’s showing too.

"Has anyone else went to see a therapist to get help from their severe depression, but once you get there your mind is so hazy and forgetful that it makes it extremely difficult to explain your experience? I found that a lot of times in the past I would be rushed out the office with crappy advice that I was already “trying” to do and then I panic and try to desperately get everything out by the end of the session. It’s hard to open up about it when I’m having an episode because the symptoms of pure confusion, difficulty thinking and focusing, MEMORY LOSS and just plain blankness of mind makes everything so frustrating...

"An unexpected side effect of depression: the decline of cognitive capabilities This has been really scaring me lately. Since becoming depressed I've noticed more and more;

- an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people

- severely reduced attention span

- short term memory loss

- severely reduced motivation

I think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism, as I spend much more time browsing reddit/youtube and getting high since when I actually try to focus on work I usually end up crying. The result seems to be a feeling like I've been living in a haze, like I'm never really fully aware of what's going on, I'm just passively going through the motions of life. 

Getting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than I thought. I literally feel stupider now that I've been depressed for months.

"Does anyone else start sobbing when they think of how much they missed out on because of their depression? I feel like my depression took my entire teen years from me. I spent all my free time in high school crying and self harming at home while everyone else had friends and hobbies and went to parties. Then I did the same thing in college. I didn’t even move out from my parents house because I was too anxious to stay in a dorm. My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn’t control. Now I’m 21 and just graduated college and I’m lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore. And I’m afraid to tell anyone because I don’t want to be sent back to a psych ward since I have no money to pay for it again. I’m just so broken right now.

One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn’t understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I’m currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can’t get out of bed... I can’t do the dishes. I can’t pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can’t. 

I just.. I can’t hear the “but.. why are you depressed?” question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone’s life.

I feel empty all the time, yeah, I have a diagnosis, yeah, but I still manage to doubt myself anyways. It almost feels like it’s normal to feel empty.

"I hate how fast I go from being okay to empty and depressed I was doing fine this past month, I’ve been getting up early and being productive and just being okay for once. I started talking to this girl and things were perfect, we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things. I haven’t been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time. Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we’re alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn’t let me. Afterwards she texted me and said she’s not ready after all and realized it when I tried to show affection in front of my friends. We’ve only been talking for about 2 weeks so it didn’t completely destroy me, but I just always get attached quick so I’m still upset about it. It seems like every person I see myself with always tends to end things for one reason or another and I’m over it. 

Being a front line worker is exhausting as it is, but having a failed “almost relationship” again is messing with my head and I’m starting to feel the darkness overwhelm my thoughts when I’ve spent the majority of the last few years working on fixing that. It’s hard when I put all my effort into people that don’t do the same back. You know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life? I’m starting to think I’m the problem behind all these failed relationships. I know she’s not worth it, I don’t think it’s her specifically making me feel this way as much as the patterns that keep occurring in my love life. I don’t know what to do anymore.

I shouldn't have to be fucking ashamed of my depression. It's as medical as the flu, yet people seem to think mental illnesses aren't a valid reason, and that you're not really sick.

"I secretly hope that I will be diagnosed with a terminal illness so I can die without taking my own life Hey Reddit. Drunk me here, mainly looking to vent because I have noone else. No alts because fuck it, might dox myself.

Picture this, I met a woman. I fell in love. Hopelessly in love. Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work.

I have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.

The woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to ""covid."" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am ""allowed"" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me.

Eventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay.

I decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me.

I am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father.

I dont know what to do. I donf know what this post was to accomplish. Maybe to rant? Get this off my chest? Who knows. I sure don't.

Edit: I barely remembered making this post. Was too afraid to look at the replies for awhile but I'm glad I did. You guys have given some real good advice and I'm thankful for it, thank you.",depression
"My therapist gave me an advice that I wanted to share As a part of my mental illness, I suffer from strong self doubts and feelings of being worthless. And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts.

So my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.

This is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.

"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do? A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. 

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you.",depression

"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",depression
"Why is it that people will call you lazy or weak for not wanting to do anything ever, but then will tell you that suicide isn't the answer? I never asked to be brought on this world, and yet I'm expected to be a ""normal adult"" and get a job, move out and maintain relationships (things that I've never known how to do). I feel like if I'll be by myself for a month I'll end it all honestly. I never asked for any of this. People think this excuse is playing the victim game, and they may be right, but why the fuck is suicide bad then? Am I supposed to rot on the streets instead? I'm just angry and I hate this.

"Don’t you hate it when you’re having a particularly bad day and your mood is really low but friends/family just assume you’re in a bad mood with them? No, I’m not angry. No, I’m not sad about anything in particular. No, I’m not upset with you. 

I just have no energy and don’t feel like talking or doing anything. So please stop making me feel guilty for being this way, please stop being short and impatient with me, please give me time and space. 

Just please, stop assuming what mood I’m in and actually listen to me for once before you actually do put me in a bad mood.",depression
"I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive Hi y’all,
Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.
We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh.
It was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.
On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It’s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself.
It’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).
I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.
I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don’t think anyone will have read this anyway.",depression

"I think my wife saved my life this morning. I have severe anxiety. Taking meds, but they’ve kind of stopped working like they used to. Got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and I mentioned “if I were to be in a place where I could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something, I don’t know what I would do with myself.” Anyway, I don’t get into depressive moods too often anymore,  it this morning, 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation (we never take vacations. Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I
messed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don’t know if it’s something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don’t have the money for the trip, but that’s ok. I know I have someone looking out for me.

It's like he seized to exist, wiped out his hard drive.. I got him when I was 14yo, my cousin gave him to me, when she learned I had a hard time because my mom had cancer and also breaking up with my father. My life was in pieces... But my cat, he mended my heart. He gave me love and support when no one else did. He was there for me, always, no matter my mood, and I loved him so so much... Now he is gone, but his physical self is there, but none of his personality, he stopped doing all the things that was him, he is only existing atm, doing all the necessary things like eat, drink, sleep, poo...

Many of these friends come to me when they are alone, depressed, or need advice. (Also he is the most glued to his phone type of person I have ever met). 

I am in therapy, and I get like regular people aren't qualified to discuss these topics sometimes and feel uncomfortable about the topic, but I guess I had hoped one of my friends would listen.

"I’m killing myself [update] So most of you probably didn’t even see my post before, which is fine, obviously, but I just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did. 3 days ago I was so close to taking my own life. I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. 

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.

I would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn’t respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they’re okay, well that is special to me. Thank you once again, and I hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. We all deserve it. This is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it.

"Forcing myself to do things makes me hate them. Doing nothing makes me hate myself. The first advice you see on googling depression is 'do things you used to enjoy!', right? Well, I've gotten really good at making myself do things. I make myself do my job. I make myself do a side hustle. I make myself read books and post about them on my blog. This month, I'm making myself do NaNoWriMo.   


I presume the idea is that, at some point, you start enjoying things again, but I haven't ever managed to get to that stage. I dread my side hustle. I never know what to say about books until I start writing. I write exactly the number of words I need to hit my goal and then I stop. I don't enjoy any of it. Some of it, I really hate. And I've been doing the side hustle for a year and five months, and the blog for two years, so it's not a matter of it 'give it time'.

I don't know how to make myself do things if I don't treat them as obligations. Anything optional, I just don't do.

I can't seem to find anything online that even mentions this being a problem, let alone actually proposing a solution.

"Having wonderful, loving, supportive family doesn’t make you any less depressed. I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. 

I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn’t help. 

There isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I’ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. 

I’ve been told I am strong because I haven’t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven’t killed myself. I’m not strong, I’m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. 

Love doesn’t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I’m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.

I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. 

Even the “good” therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn’t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. 

My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can’t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn’t make me feel better, just guilty.

All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn’t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn’t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. 

My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won’t affect anyone.

"Depression is the hot funny meme until you're not sleeping, not eating, and hoping you'll die in a car accident I never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually. Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. 

I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. 

I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. 

It's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything. I wish there was a way to turn brains off.

"I play video games every waking moment so I can avoid thinking. Being alone with my thoughts is so awful. It’s painful and difficult and I have absolutely no control. I just ruminate on so many painful memories, I get trapped in thought spirals affirming all of these awful assessments I’ve made about myself in the wake of primarily trauma and abuse, but there’s a lot of elements of truth to them, and I can’t really avoid thinking about them or that, unless I manage to avoid thinking at all. I just wake up and do the bare minimum to exist (and often times don’t even achieve that as I dwell in self neglect...) and pour every minute o can into video games until I’m exhausted enough to pass out within minutes of laying down, because if I don’t then I’ll lay in bed for hours making myself (even more) miserable. This is so awful and so difficult and it feels impossible to do anything about it. I am in hell.",depression
"I just killed my pet bird. What is even the fucking point anymore? I took my bird out when the door was open and it flew off my shoulder. In a moment of panic I slammed the door... right onto his head. Everyone in my family is telling me “it’s not your fault” and “it was a mistake”, but guess who always fucking makes mistakes? ME. And now my mistakes are causing the deaths of those I love. I hate myself so much I don’t even see the point of going on anymore.

Edit: Oh my god, thank you everyone! It’s been a really hard day and the support I’ve had from my family and you guys has helped a lot. It’s still an on going process, but I’m trying not to blame myself for it. Hearing your stories actually helped a lot, it let me know I wasn’t alone in this and that it is possible to move on. Thanks guys :)",depression
"I feel like I’m getting dumber and dumber everyday. I don’t know if there’s something physically wrong with me or if it’s just stress related, but for about 2 years now, I feel as if my cognitive abilities have been worsening. 

I can barely hold a conversation anymore. When I do talk, I stutter/stammer/mispronounce words. My mind blanks out a lot and my attention span is nonexistent. 

I used to be a really smart kid. Performed very well on the SAT despite having awful grades due to feeling indifferent about school. Then after high school, I became a full blown hypochondriac along with having generalized/social anxiety as well. 2 years ago I felt like I was THE man, and today I feel like an incompetent moron who becomes less functional each day. I think I’m recovering from my anxiety disorders, but I sometimes wonder if I’m actually just normalizing them, causing the illusion of recovery.

I don’t know where to go. I’ve really been trying to get better but I feel like I go two steps forward and three steps back. Can anyone else relate to this? Currently typing this out standing in the shower, feeling pretty down right now.

"The fact that I'm supposed to keep living and I'm not allowed to kill myself annoys me honestly. If I don't wanna keep going why should I? I had no choice in my birth and I don't have a choice really in my death either. I mean I could off myself but no one would really respect my choice. I don't know, I don't get much joy out of life. I never really had much of a chance to, I get some but I don't know if it's worth going on and on forever. I hate all of the obligations there are to stay alive. I stay alive mostly for other people, I know that's important. I wish I could be selfish and die. I used to think growing up that once my parents both died I'd just kill myself too, I feel like that might still be a good plan for me. 

I have goals and desires, as well as things I want to do. But I also don't really enjoy life. This is all selfish I'm aware. Perhaps it's wrong of me to think this way but I feel resentment towards my existence. Resentment towards the obligations and feelings I hold towards others. Resentment of my love for them and their love for me. I daydream about becoming a major asshole to everyone, just so I can off myself and have people celebrate my death. But I also can't bring myself to be a jerk.",depression

"Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same. I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post.

"I called the suicide hotline, the lady seemed irritated and then abruptly put me on hold. I’ve been very depressed and having intrusive thoughts. I had a big panic attack at like 4:30am and no friends were awake to call at that hour, so I went on a limb and I called the suicide hotline.

I told her I have been depressed for a long time, my life, finances, family, job, everything is going terribly. I keep having the thought that it’d just be easier to end it all. I’ve been abusing alcohol heavily as well. 

She recommended therapy. I said I was going to therapy for a while, but it was expensive and didn’t seem to help at all so I stopped going.

“Um, you can afford alcohol but you can’t afford therapy?” She audibly scoffed into the phone and put me on hold indefinitely. Eventually I hung up.

"Cheers to everyone on here, this sub is the only place I feel accepted. We may be depressed, but we are never dicks to one another or reject each other's voices. Whenever someone posts something wholesome, everyone cheers for them. Nobody is envious or salty of seeing others get better.  
&nbsp;

Whenever someone posts something depressing, everyone comforts them. Nobody one-ups one another. This sub's etiquette is the epitome of ""Always be nice to people, but if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all.""  
&nbsp;

On other subs like AskReddit, whenever I post a question, it'll always get downvoted right away. I seriously don't care about karma, I just wish my questions become visible because I'm genuinely curious. My questions are usually something like, ""People who manage to get their life together, how did you do it?"".  
&nbsp;

I ask those questions because I'm looking for hope. I try not to make them sound negative but they'll always get downvoted. That makes me feel like I'm not allowed to hear something wholesome. It's like I'm being denied hope.  
&nbsp;

On this sub, it is normal for a post to have 2K upvotes, and stays 99% upvoted, if not 100%. Posts that don't take of, and only have 1 default upvote will usually stay 100% upvoted. So that means the people here very rarely downvote anything. If they're not upvoting it, they just leave it be. We use the upvote and downvote for what they're meant to.

r/depression is not a community in the same sense that r/<put hobby here> is a community (we're not striving to be good at being depressed, we just want it to stop), but this sub is a comforting place despite its depressive nature.

"Just because someone has it worse doesn’t make your pain unjustified. I hate when people say something along the lines of, “This guy got through this, so you’ll be fine.” When someone is going through tough times in their lives, that is the last thing they’d want to hear. It makes me feel like shit and I’m sure it’s the same for them. It’s toxic and it won’t make someone who’s depressed feel any better if not worse. Think of it as, “Being stabbed by a knife hurts as much as being stabbed by a sword.” Just because the blades smaller doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt. The only reason I’m posting it here is because I hear this toxic shit everywhere. I get it if they are trying to comfort you and they don’t know what to say, but I would think they’d understand it wouldn’t make it any better just because some other guy had it worse.

While yes it can bring someone who’s whining about something trivial to perspective, there’s a line that’s crossed when you tell something like that to someone who’s actually going through depression/tough times.

It only makes me feel worse when I hear this, so if you are going through depression/tough times how would you respond to this? I honestly don’t know how and it makes me feel like shit and that me having gone through depression was something meaningless.",depression

"I (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression? The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied ""200 km/h"".

I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.

I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was ""wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself"". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).

The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: ""It's a miracle you're alive"". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I""m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).

If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.

Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.

Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:

\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?

\-How can I keep up or have more energy?

\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)

\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?

\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?

\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

&#x200B;

Thanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Edit: more questions

Edit 2: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. I truly didn't believe this would reach this many people. I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way. Thank you, I will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life.",depression
"I’ve been staying up until 5am playing video games and then sleeping until 3-4pm everyday I have no desire to get up earlier and do something with my day even though if I could force myself I’d probably feel better. 

It starts to get dark within an hour of waking up usually and it’s so depressing but it keeps me isolated in my “comfort zone” 

Being up in the middle of the night feels freeing for some reason, no one awake, no guilt for responsibilities, I can sleep away the day and not feel guilty about it.

But I’m wasting time and I want more than anything to feel okay again. I want to start to get my life back to something that I can derive some genuine enjoyment out of and move forward with productive things. 

I became depressed again about 10 months ago since my mom passed and these past 10 months have gone by so fast, I’m almost 26 and I’m scared at how fast time is moving without any stability forming in my life. 

TLDR: I’m 25 and I feel like I’m wasting time, which I am. But it’s so hard to even attempt to start getting my life in order. 

It feels so far out of reach",depression
"no identity, no personality Does anybody else feel like they 'are just there'?

I feel like there is no depth to me. I have no interests anymore, everything feels like a chore. I don't feel like a real person, only a spectator - I am here, but not really. I have no personality. I pick up some traits I see in others, or on TV. I feel like I am just a mix of various people I've considered interesting, and I just impersonate and mimic them. I just live and do what others want me to do. I feel like an empty shell. I daydream all the time, and sometimes feel like I am losing touch with reality. Sometimes I can't recall what my face looks like, all I see are parts of it, and it feels unfamiliar and uncomfortable. 

I have no idea what is going on with me. I've been growing more and more suicidal each day. I just wish I could feel okay for a moment.",depression
"Anne Frank She really said it best:

“Dead people receive more flowers than the living ones because regret is stronger than gratitude.”

God damn, am I sick of being alive. I’m 29 and really can’t envision another 60 years of wanting to hurt myself, feeling like no one gives a fuck and hoping I die in some type of accident.",depression
"I don't want to kill myself, but if I were to die tomorrow I would be happy It isn't quite like ""wanting to die"" but more like ""not wanting to live"", has anyone been overwhelmed by this feeling as well?",depression
"Does anyone else get morning depression? Every day when I wake up, I feel suuuuper depressed for the first few hours of being up. For the rest of the day it comes and goes but it’s every morning without fail.",depression
"I feel like suicide is inevitable Not that I want to kill myself right this instant but it feels like it's too late to prevent it. Something bad is going to happen later on down the line and then I'll just end it. There's no way around it so long as I don't die suddenly in a car crash or something. I feel like I'm one of those people who just never gets better.

Edit: why did this post blow up this was just a depressive vent post

Edit 2: why is this being given wholesome awards reddit baffles me sometimes

Edit 3: I feel like I should add some context to my depression that may differ from your own experience. My depression mainly comes from a place of self-loathing  and my own inability to accept myself. I have people who I care about and who care about me but I feel like depression has manifested into my personality and it is a part of who I am now. This is why I feel that suicide is inevitable for me personally.",depression
"“I can’t try to commit suicide tonight because if I fail and survive I have work in the morning.” That’s the scariest/most pathetic thought that runs through my brain on work nights. I hate this world I live in. I hate being so alone all of the time. 


**I wish with all of my being there was a simple way out.**",depression
"I wanted to kill myself at 8 years old so I swallowed a bunch of Flintstone vitamins. I laugh at it now after all these years. I had seen it on TV that someone committed suicide by od. All it did I think was give me an upset stomach. I'm 27 now. Honestly surprised I'm still here. I've been feeling very suicidal the past couple of days. The only thing that stops me is my baby brother I take care of everyday. When he goes home though, I don't know. I just hope my mood is better by then. I know part of me doesn't want to die but the feeling is so forceful and impulsive.",depression
"Done with waiting for change. Done with hoping things will get better. I’m going to push myself even harder now ... even if it kills me! I’m fed up of waiting on other people. It’s clear nobody really gives a shit about me.

So sod it. I’m going to go and do my own thing. No help from anyone. I’ve gone this long being a loner I’ll just accept it’s my life. I’m going to adopt a do or die attitude and this will end either with me ending myself or something beautiful. I’m going to apply for every job under the sun. I’m going to write this book I’ve been putting off. I’m going to claw my way out of debt.

Wish me luck my friends 💓 I have nothing left to lose.",depression
"Did your depression mess with your attention span? Because i cannot bring myself to focus on things  i could do normally before, be it hobbies, watching movies, reading, and so on. All i feel is lying down all day and doing nothing.

edit: mixed feelings with the responses ive been reading. Sucks to hear that I am not alone with experiencing this. I just hope that some day, some miracle might happen to our lives and bring back the spark we once lost.",depression
"i'm not doing any better i just got better at hiding it. instead of called in from work or breaking down during my shift i cry on the drive to work.
instead of ranting on instagram or ranting on facebook i cry myself to sleep.
instead of telling people how i feel, i say im fine and smile knowing no one could understand how fucked iam.
instead of threating to kill myself, ive come to terms with the fact that i'll be gone soon once i get to my breaking point and end it all.",depression
"Anyone else feel like maybe you are just starting to get it together and then one little f*&# up sends you plummeting into the abyss again? It does not even have to be a major incident, but that tenuous grasp you had on climbing out of the hole, that little bit of hope that things are starting to turn around, suddenly releases and you are plummet back into the pit; and now you are too damn tired to try climbing out again ...",depression
I want someone to notice how not okay i really am I feel so empty. to the point that things i used to laugh at i no longer find amusing. Call me a coward but ive never told anyone about the way i feel maybe in order to be able to carry on with life with no more complications. I just want  someone to hold me close and tell me its going to be ok. I guess this is my cry for help.,depression
It hurts realizing who you really are It hurts realizing that your not this deep down to earth interesting smart person. Realizing you just a piece of trash that is useless. It doesnt matter wether im here or not. It just breaks my heart to realize that.,depression
"Holy fucking shit I can’t stop beating myself up over past mistakes I think of a name, a face, a place, a year—the only things I can recollect are negative. I’ll just be driving in the car or sitting in my room, then these thoughts hit me like a fucking locomotive: “Remember that stupid weird shit you said 6 years ago?” Or “remember that group of people whom you tried to befriend earlier in freshman year of college only to be rejected, and you didn’t really care for them much anyways but holy fuck, you are so dysfunctional and weird and retarded?” It goes on, “remember how you chose to not talk to that cute girl who showed clear-as-the-fucking-day signs of interest in you but still opted to not talk to because you’re that brain dead and insecure?”
It doesn’t stop. It never fucking does. It’s like I’m haunted by my relatively uneventful past. I involuntarily think of these social/romantic/academic/attention-deficit/practical failures, and then I think of how great it would be if I could just roll over and die, never mind how. No more mistakes. No more disappointments. I’m tired, I’m tired of being tired, and I’m tired of being tired of being. I’m not suicidal, yet at the same time, I feel like I’m just one bad day from doing myself in; however, I could never do that to my friends and family. It’s a weird fucking feeling. I don’t normally post here... Thanks for coming to my TED Talk on Stupid Bullshit.

Edit: Thanks so much for the support. Stay sane and stay safe!",depression
"""Suicide isn't an answer"" Yes, but it seems like an option. The only real option. The only button that ends eternal pain and suffering. Fade away from everywhere and become nothingness. All your sorrows and misery, agony gone in the blink of an eye. And you know what's the best part? It's free! You don't need to pay to kill yourself, but you need to pay to live. It's the easy way out, the only beautiful way out. It's not much, we all die at some point wouldn't hurt to cut myself off from everything as I would lose my consciousness.  

But I am here to live for the mental well being of other people, so they don't be sad. I suffer for them. Yet they wouldn't take a minute to listen to one of those millions of thoughts I have ruining my head. Ironic.",depression
"literally the only thing in my life keeping me from going completely off the rails is my cat i love him and as long as he is around i will devote myself to his care, comfort, and happiness. beyond that i do not give a shit. he's my reason. he's why i work and take my meds and try to at least pretend i see a future for myself that doesn't suck. i would do anything for him, including stay alive. 

and if you have an issue with that or think it's funny or whatever, hey go fuck yourself.",depression

"“I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone“ This quote by Robin Williams has destroyed me. I’ve realized why I hate being with people more than being alone, even if I’m smiling and having fun. 

*EDIT* wow, thanks so much to every single supportive comment. means more than the world to feel supported. to everyone suggesting social media is a cause of this- is not the case here. i don’t use social media, because I know the conversations on there don’t follow me to my grave ❤️ real life human connection does. today was a good day, thankyou everyone for your love.",depression
"25, an aging, worthless failure I have failed in nearly everything I had set out to do. I have no confidence to do anything else. 

I have no proper education, no friends, no job, no travel experience, no positive memories, no good relationships with anyone, no confidence, no productive hobbies, no self worth, and no future.

I'm worthless trash at the peak of my youth. The people I grew up with are pursuing their dream careers and traveling the world, enjoying their lives. I am sat here taking care of my needy family, looking for pathetic jobs, and engaging in escapism to forget that I am who I am.

I am 25 years old this year, a stupid idiot, a weak coward, a life loser, and a complete waste of space",depression

"I think about suicide everyday, but I’m not planning it Why does my brain constantly resort to wanting to kill myself? Every single day that’s my answer, I want to get it out of my head because I feel like if it continues for too long I may do something.
I have nothing planned, I just think about it all the time. Why is this?",depression
"Does anyone else feel like being depressed is just part of them? and its something that they will never be able to change about themselves or 'cure'? I literally cannot remember a time in my life where I wasn't angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me. I've had body issues since I was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day, which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents. I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted. In the same way that people say 'once an addict, always an addict', I've come to believe the same thing about my depression.",depression
"Trying to succeed in college when you’re depressed fucking sucks. Everyone says “try harder” or “I know you can do it” and all I wanna say to them is shut the living fuck up. I can’t try harder and I can’t do it, if I could I obviously would. I know they care but they’re also being inconsiderate by assuming I’m just choosing to fail my classes. I’ve been struggling with depression for a few years, I feel the lowest I’ve ever felt right now. I’ve in therapy and I take meds and I still can’t handle all the pressure and responsibilities of living. Depression kills :/

Wow, I did not expect this to reach so many people. I have read any single kind comment everyone has left, sorry if I haven’t replied immediately I’m trying.

"I made it. Yesterday I went to a clinic because of my injured leg. While I was talking to my doctor about my injury, suddenly I had an urge to talk about what I’ve been feeling for the past 5 years. It took a lot of courage since I never talked to any adults about it because I was too anxious and scared. I cried, my hands were shaking and I couldn’t really talk properly but what I knew was I finally seek a proper treatment. I knew I was depressed and the doctor diagnosed me with it. I’m only 18 years old this year and I’m currently studying at college right now. I’m embarrassed when I remember the way I broke down in front of the doctor. But I did. I finally talked.",depression

"I have no personality Does anyone else feel like they have no personality because of depression? For me the downward spiral started when I was 11 or so, so being depressed is basically all I remember. I don't know who I was before that, or who I am now. 

I always just feel like a carbon copy of whatever person I'm talking to, putting on a fitting mask and trying to please them with the personality I fake for them. I can't, for the life of me, tell you a single characteristic of me, except for my anxiety and depression. 

When I'm alone, I tend to talk to myself (probably out of loneliness and the longing for actual human interaction, and yeah I know it's weird) and then I feel like a blanc slate. Like there's nothing to me.

Does anyone else want to kill themself but they don’t want to do that to their family so they go by day by day with the only true motivation in their life being the day they finally grow distant enough from their family that they can end it all without the guilt The worst part is now I have a girlfriend that I’ve dating for a while and I’m crazy about her and we’ve talked about our future together numerous times and she’s the single that can prevent me from reaching that true point of fully distanced from those I care about and it somehow makes me sad instead of happy,depression
"Does anyone weirdly find comfort in their depression? When I feel ok, I feel off. When I sink into a depressive mindset, in a twisted way my brain feels almost satisfied.

"Did anyone else's depression fuck up their career or university/schooling experience? I was a high-achieving student in high school, went to university and shit hit the fan, graduated a year later than everyone else and is still unemployed 9 months later.

Keeping up communication is rough sometimes. A day of not replying to a message can become a week when you don't know how to explain that you just couldn't be around people that day, which can become a month when it always seems impossible to reach out and explain where you've been.

I don't know where I'm going with this post, I just needed to vent that out. I had the day off from work and I spent it in bed, scrolling through the same few apps.

Unfortunately as i’ve been neglecting sleep it’s gotten me in trouble with my parents and it’s mostly because I have a hard time telling them the truth as to why I’m not sleeping.

"Depression turned me into an idiot. I used to be quite a bright kid, at least, according to what everyone said. After years of trauma and abuse, however, depression completely overcame my life, and after so long, I feel it has utterly destroyed my brain; fried it, like an overloaded computer. I genuinely forget how old I am sometimes. I struggle doing basic math. My short-term memory has deteriorated to nothing. Etc. I just feel as though I'm slowing down only more each passing day.

In the past two weeks, wrestling my inner demons, I lost so much weight and have lost so much mental curiosity and interest I used to possess. But recently, after watching Being Erica as some of you recommended, I realized that ""no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself."" I suppose regrets will come in different forms, no matter what I do or try, the outcome would be the same that I'd be short of what I desire to be. To be honest, I don't know what a solution could be here, but I suppose seeking it is part of that endless struggle. ",depression

"I'm just saying I've never been thankful that I didn't kill myself Ever since my first suicidal thoughts when I was like 14 (22 now) people say ""aren't you so thankful you're still here?""



No. The answer is always no. I've never once thought I'm glad I didn't do it. I've only ever regretted NOT doing it. If I had just acted on my first suicidal impulses or any of them after I'd have been so much better off. Not a thing has happened I should've cared about missing.



My life has only gotten so so much worse. Now I WISH I felt how I did when I first felt suicidal. That was roses compared to this shit and I actively wanted to die then too. My life has gotten so much more fucked up than i could've ever thought then, and I really only would've missed out on suffering.



I've only been alive because 1. Suicide is way harder than people think and 2. I'm supposed to and guess what?


I'm not thankful for it. Jesus Christ do I wish I had just killed myself 8 years ago or *any* time since. I've never once been thankful for not killing myself",depression

"I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. 

Ever since I was  little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he’s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he’s done with me.

My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.

Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an ""ass whooping mood"" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.

I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.

Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.

He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\*\*\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.

What will the cops do about it when they come?",depression
"Anybody ever been depressed since a child but only realised it was depression when you got older? Ever since I was young, I can't remember what age but definitely younger than 10.

"23 F. I feel so behind Everyone. I feel like a 13 year old. I know I shouldnt complain at 23 But Ive struggled with depression since I was 13. Every year. For 10 years. I have few positive memories. Im tired and I dont want to do keep trying anymore. Everything ive tried never has worked. Meditation. CBT. Psychologists. Psychiatrists. Medication. Sleeping Pills. Weed.

I feel so young (because I havent literally done much at all with my depression+anxiety) but ancient at the same time. I have no passions, no interests. No goals. Havent had good friends in years. Virgin. I dont go out. I dont take photos, I dont use social media. I feel like I dont exist. I dont even have a fucking job now. Never had a boyfriend.

Literally the only thing Ive done is graduate university and I cant even get a fucking job.

Ive struggled in everything ive ever done. School. Hobbies. Uni. Work. Job Applications. Appearance.

The only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs. I just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life. Even people who are 17-18, have had more experiences then me. I hardly go out. Ive spent 90% of time at home alone with my elderly parents. 

I try so hard, but Im still a loser and I hate it. Im not introverted and I just hate how my life has become. I hate it..I do. I feel like I must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better. These last 6 years in particular have flown and Im just so fucking done.

Its not like Ive tried. For 2 years Ive tried joining groups, volunteering etc to improve my situation but i get nowhere. No one wants a bar of me.

"Each month that passes I feel sadder and sadder. Please, somebody read me. Hello.

Ever since I was little, I've been very emotional. As time has passed and I've been able to understand better the world around me, I find disgust. I dislike how everything is money and manipulation and how you can't do anything if you don't play along. My family is broken and I can't share my feelings with anybody, and when I do is usually with my mother and she always makes me feel worse, or guilty about everything. I feel like an idiot.

I used to go to therapy before the pandemic, it was quite good but sadly my doctor passed away due to old age. I'm not in a place right now where I can pay therapy. I'm also not motivated. I just want everything to end. I want to stop being me. I don't want these memories anymore.

I don't want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself. I barely even have the energy to write well. I want to vent about how much I hate myself. How FUCKED UP I am.

I've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me.

My family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say: ""this too shall pass"", ""believe what you want to believe"" ""if you believe it won't happen, it won't."" Yeah, great. Thanks for the ""help."" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income.

I am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off.

All I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go ""that sucks, pass the apple juice"", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them.

I don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways.

"Do you ever feel guilty that your parents got stuck with such an incompetent failure? I think about it a lot. My mom has a friend of hers who has 2 kids. One is in an Ivy League school and the other is going to a nice university. They both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. 

Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. I don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or I have to go out somewhere. I have severe ADHD and don't really do well taking basic classes. I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think ""if only she knew how I would turn out."" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this. 

Anytime my dad comes home from work I have trouble even looking him in the eye because I know I'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes.

"I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time. I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.

I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" 

My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.

Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.

Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. 

And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?

I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get ""advice"" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these ""sessions"", lol.",depression

 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.",depression
"My sister saved my life yesterday. There I was minutes away from grabbing my gun, about to walk in the woods and end it. Was actually starting to feel pretty good about that too. Not having to hate myself, going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me. Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it. Hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me. I should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me, plus then the whole family would know.

"Depression turns me into a bitter self-destructive asshole w no empathy It’s such a toxic downward spiral. My depression manifests itself as chronic indifference, loss of interest in doing anything, no hope/purpose in life, and the general malaise causes me to, perhaps worst of all, turn into a bitter, insufferable asshole. Everything and everyone bothers me to a much stronger degree. I become increasingly judgemental and dismissive of others. I lash out and hurt those close to me when I need them most. It’s like I’m a completely different person; everything sucks, everyone sucks, and I don’t want to deal with any of it. 

It’s incredibly destructive but I honestly can’t help myself, as I’m too depressed to even maintain a conversation and feign interest or empathy in anyone to begin with. I used to be so charismatic, but trying to rekindle that energy again just makes me come off as janky and contrived. Again, I’m like a completely different person. Spooky.",depression

I feel like i am going to get exposed as a fraud and get fired and not find another gig. Toxic mix of having no confidence combined with lack of drive to do anything about it creates chronic and lingering sense of anxiety and the vicious circle continues",depression
I feel like my depression and anxiety has prevented me from reaching my true potential I always felt that I could have been something way better than I am now. I am barely scrapping by and spend most of my time in bed often daydreaming about how things could have gone for me if I had done things differently.,depression
"Life is a neverending wave of chores and I'm tired of it, I just want to rest I need a new inspection sticker for my car, the time has come to renew my driver's license, I need to do my bi weekly wash of my car, I need to order contact lenses I'm almost out, gotta go cut my grandma's grass, my room is getting messy need to clean my room, I need to get more cat food, oh my cat chewed through my USB charging cable I need to buy a new cable asap, I need to write out and send out the checks for water and electric, I need to put together a budget so I can start tracking my finances....oh it's been 90 days since I logged into by bank so I actually have to call the bank and speak to a representative to access my online banking, I'm way past due seeing a dentist, also need to see a doctor because of a weird lump that hasn't gone away, I ran out of juice for my vape I need to make a trip to the vape shop, my dad needs me to come over to help him because he can't get his Internet to work

All on top of a mentally and spiritually crushing 40 hour work week that leaves me with only a few hours of personal time to and energy to get this tasks done, a job that barely pays enough to get by that sucks the souls out of me

An endless wave after wave crashing into me, just to sustain basic human life and fulfill my obligations in society

I'm tired of feeling useless and having no real talents.

A part of me doesn't  want to care about being successful

The rat race is driving me crazy.

I've been fired from almost every job I've had.

Even the job I had with someone in my family.

They told me I had too many mental problems.

Everyday I watch my family go to jobs they hate and spend most of their free time sleeping.

I have mental problems that keep me locked in the house.

I'm mostly introverted and I try to enjoy my own company.

Everyone I ever meet has never tried to keep in touch with me.

When speaking online to people I'm ignored most of the time.

So I stay quiet because I already know the outcome.

My councilor has missed two of the meeting we were suppose to have.

Acting like they didn't know they had an appointment.

If anyone read this I will be surprised.

God please help me !

I could spend hours of my day doing something and completely forgetting the real world for a while. Now I can't find the motivation to do anything.

But I think most of all I miss how hopeful I was. Despite everything I fully believed that it'll get better, that the future will be a good one for me. And I've lost that completely.

"Today was my 21st birthday I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. 


EDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. For all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. Your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. I can't say it enough: thank you, thank you, thank you. ",depression

"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs. I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. 

Thanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness. Along with having a parent who doesn't make your suffering all about them and why you shouldn't be depressed.",depression

"Have you ever seen your friends smile and thought ""Yeah they are better off without me*? I'll start by saying this : Under no circumstances have my friends ever treated me poorly.

It's been a while since that happened. The bell rang and the break began. So I went to find them and when I did they were laughing so hard (I was in my very lows that day), I felt so nice for them and at the same time I thought ""I can't offer them that"". Before we went back to the classes, I let them walk infront of me because I didn't feel like being 100% in the mood and just by looking at them I kept thinking how great they are together.
Now today I saw some Insta stories of them staying at the house of the one I am closest to and it kinda hit me again. I hope I am not just jealous. It's just that at points I feel like I annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that.

I always tell jokes and laugh and 90% of the time they won't even notice the state of me because of how well I hide it. I love them, yet I am sure they deserve someone who is not like me.  Especially the one I am or used to (yes I am insecure) be closest to. She deserves the world and she's always been there for me but I can't keep being a burden to someone so kind, whom I love so much. I just feel like they ""clicked"" so much better and even though on one hand it kinda hurts on the other it is nice to see them like that. Especially when the other one got hurt by her once best friend.

I've devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures - tons of social/hobby clubs, going out to bars and trying to dance with people, attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events (whether because I'm interested in the event itself or because I feel like going would make me seem more interesting) - and I hate all of it. I haven't met a single person I enjoy spending time with. Even my academics make me miserable. To top it all off, when someone detects I'm pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards.

**And it just resonated with me.** Depression is such an ass. Struggling with depression has fucked with my life so bad that I ended up self-harming and nearly killing myself three times this year. And I couldn't do it because I'm too afraid. I want things to end. But I couldn't. 

At this moment, I'm not suicidal. I'm not even at the point that I'm severely depressed to the point I can't function normally. It just resonates with my struggle, especially with my experience for years, but this year in particular... The fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesn't. The fact that I still have it despite having great family, friends and a loving girlfriend. The fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely. The fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future. And ultimately, the fact that I realize that its such a miracle that I'm waking up each day, still alive, and bravely battling depression.

"Don't promise a mentally ill person that you'll never leave them. It's just fucking cruel.

I first had a best friend who did this, in all fairness it was my fault our relationship downhill but even during that she insisted she'd still be there for me, yet when I eventually decide to try take up the offer to reconnect I'm ghosted.

Then my boyfriend promised me he'd never leave me throughout the 8 months we were together but then he dumps me out of the blue , the half assed stuff he did tell me was likely just because he thought id fucking kill myself if he was truthful. He said he still wants to be there for me but has yet to give off even a sense that he cares, I wouldn't be suprised if he got with the girl he almost cheated on me with right after dumping me.

My point is, never make a promise like this to someone who you know is vulnerable.

"“Suicide is a solution to a temporary problem” I hate that phrase, and I mark anyone who uses it as a fake who doesn’t actually give a shit other than to make themselves feel better for trying to “help”

As someone who is depressed suicide isn’t an option on the table for me yet,  but when it comes to it the only thing I’m gonna hear or read if someone says that to me is that it’s a “Solution”

Edit:  Sorry.  The phrase is “Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem”

"ever look back on your life and just wonder what happened to you? i used to be so outgoing and carefree. i was content with myself because i didnt really have the capacity at that point to dislike myself at all - like, i didnt really know what that was, and i hadn't really lived much of life at that point to have developed anxiety and other issues. i didnt overanalyse and overthink. i actually used to walk about without this constant pit feeling in my stomach and without anxiety filling up my chest all the time. i genuinely used to be fine, and now im not so much. if i sit for a while and actually, genuinely think about how i physically and emotionally felt and think about my past perception of the world it is so different from how i feel now. and occasionally i'll get a fleeting feeling that reminds me of the contentedness i had when i was younger but it never stays. and it makes me so sad

"""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger""... Just no. I hate this, I hear it here and there and my blood starts boiling every time.

No, everything in life that happens isnt somehow okay because ""oh you've learned from it.""

I'm not stronger because of my trauma, I am strong inspite of it. 

Me living with depression, going through different trauma, trying to kill myself twice and everything in between hasnt made me stronger, I would gladly not have gone through these things. 

This rant was sponsored by me being pissed.

"I hate how people are automatically given the title attention whore if they don’t hide their depression well enough At least for me I’ve hated how people say something like “oh that person isn’t actually depressed, it’s just for attention.”

I don’t understand the whole complex between depression and attention but I do know nothing feels worse than being in a depressive episode and having nobody to talk to. 

Maybe it stems from that.

All I want is my best friend back.
For us to have real conversations again.

Too bad I have self sabotaging tendencies but that’s a story for another day.

I just don’t want to feel completely alone anymore.

"I know the post will go down here ... But I have serious problems. I should quit my life. First of all ... I have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me, but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once. 

About me, 31 years old, I am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert. 

My life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes I wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not. 

I grew up in an already broken family. My mother was married 3x and divorced 3x (I am the child of the second husband). I can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood (which makes it worse for me) One of the first memories I have (about 3,5 years) my father went after my mother with a knife. And even stabbed through a door with a knife. He was then thrown out by my grandparents and I saw him only once a short time later. He was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me (even when my ex-wife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number...). Without my knowledge)

In the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and I knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic. 

After he was no longer there, my mother had quickly met someone new, my stepfather. He was 8 years younger than my mother. 

Unfortunately, he was also very aggressive. As a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him, it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled, often thrown on dishes on the walls. He became unfortunately also now and then Handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother (whereby my brother was rather his favorite, since he was older and could make more with him). After we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced. My stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin (yes it does not get better).

After the separation, my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy, because no one could keep the house alone, my mother also had to file for bankruptcy. 

Shortly after that we moved of course, unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a full-time job again and lives since then on social benefits. 

With my brother (child of my first husband and 3 years older than me) I never had a really good relationship, mostly he didn't want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together. He was also not at the same school as me, he was never very educated unfortunately. 

He also moved out quite early, because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather (because he got along with him). He then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather. 

Generally he was always very strange. He watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower. (And played with himself while doing so). He is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his. (Probably several times) And has often set fire with a friend together.

He somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children. But usually it did not last very long. When it was over, he often set a fire somewhere. What I knew about afterwards was his own car, A garden shed, A meadow, and finally an attic of an apartment building, whereupon he was arrested and sentenced. However only on probation. 

His last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years. Only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger (a complete change of heart). Which was then suddenly pregnant immediately, after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again. 

However I had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died (who have reached a proud age 92 and 94).

In general, I have also completely broken off contact in the meantime, because after several attempts on my part, no normal relationship can develop between us. I can not even have a reasonable conversation with him, because you just notice he seems to be very stupid (I just can not express it differently).

About me .. I also made a lot of mistakes in life. 

Unfortunately for me, I almost didn't focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class (my mom didn't care what I did or didn't do anyway, she never showed up for a parent-teacher conference either). 

I wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp. My goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training, unfortunately I got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later. 

Then I ended up in a larger company where I had worked until today. 

I started drinking myself very early (15 years), because I myself had a very bad environment, the city I lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing. Also through my education I drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that I completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times. This was no better in the armed forces. Was able to make the leap in my mid 20's though and quit. I don't even drink beer in between anymore because I just don't feel like it. I also take my other drugs (although I sometimes wonder if maybe I should). Or smoke either.

I have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships, because I could not be alone ... My first relationship lasted 5 years circa and I was married myself and had to divorce and have a son. 

My ex-wife, however, always wanted to make life difficult for me and I got deeply into debt because of her, since she, among other things, never completed an education. Just like that, she quit her jobs and I was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them, whereupon I received debt collection letters. 

I had to declare insolvency at some point, because we also had a joint loan running.

I had also met a new woman half a year later and moved. Only my ex-wife really sabotaged this relationship and it didn't last long. Also because I wanted to see my son regularly.

I then decided to stay alone for 2 years, but lived near my ex-wife again because of my son. 

When I met my current partner, I decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others. And moved a little further away. Got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill.

Also this time my ex-wife has tried to make our life hell, which led to the fact that I have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year. 

My job has also deteriorated more and more, because the company was bought up 3x and changed. The work climate has made me more and more broken and I had a second herniated disc. 

In addition, I was then admitted to a day clinic, because I was also psychologically at the end. After a few months there, I was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism. 

I discontinued this therapy a year later because it didn't help me at all.

In the meantime, however, I have screwed everything up ... I had to give up my job for health reasons, although I have a GDB of 30% and was equalized. I am also about to lose my partner, because there is more and more crisis between us. I really don't have anyone in my life anymore. 

I have moved 13 times in my life in general. And have lost a lot of contacts and friends. I also lost some contacts because of my ex-wife. 

I generally only have contact with some friends I met online or old work colleagues. 

I also see my mother about 1-2 times a year but I don't care if I see her at all or not. But she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren.

I must also say to myself, I was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it. I always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything, even when I write this text. You could subordinate it under ""joke addiction or Moria"". I also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if I just drop something. Unfortunately I'm also very forgetful and often don't know what I'm supposed to do several times a day. (I probably owe that to the alcohol). All in all, due to narcism I often have the impression of being emotionally dead. I cry in the rarest situation at all (even if sad videos still carry me away). I can hardly show empathy towards others. I also really don't care about much and I notice it more and more. That I really don't care about anything that happens. Apart from my children, I have never really had the feeling of being happy. In general, almost nothing good has ever happened to me. 

Conclusion: So now I wonder does it even make sense for me to exist? 

I am insolvent I have a divorce behind me. My partner will leave me soon. I have no job anymore. No friends . And probably soon no more apartment (since I then the insolvent also no new apartment more find). 

EDIT: 

First of all, thank you all! 

You have really touched my heart, even if it is hard for me to admit something like that. 

You don't have to worry about me doing anything to myself! 

I don't want my children to have a horrible childhood like me! 

Besides, for your love! You are really great and I understood that there are things in life worth living for! 
Of course, I will also seek professional help. 
It is not very easy to get appointments here but I will keep at it and not give up!

"Does anyone else, when they're in a really depressed mood, feel like they're just acting sad to get attention? I mean myself personally. Whenever I feel down I automatically start shaming myself by saying I'm only acting like this because I want someone else to feel bad for me. But I know that's not what I want, or at least I think it's not what I want. IDK. Does anyone else ever feel like this though?",depression
"Whether I live or die, the world will remain unaffected. I won't be missed by more than the two people who I depend on.

People will continue to justify life's arbitrary and meaningless cruelty with fantastical explanations. They will continue to center their lives around those fantastical explanations.

By chance of birth, some people will continue to live great lives and others will continue to suffer. The lucky ones will go through life engaged and curious, and the rest will gradually be beaten down by rigidity, conformity, or cruelty.

The endless, toxic, and useless discourse that has come to define online life will not cease.

The universe's countdown to extinction won't stop.

Babies will continue to be born into abuse, never having a chance.

People will continue falling in love, every kiss taunting my lonely time on this Earth. 

In an effort to fight against meaningless absurdity, people will continue to hate and wage war.

Billions of farm animals will continue being bred into existence, with all their capacity to feel pain and terror intact, only to live cramped and miserable lives that end in systematic slaughter.

Romantics will continue to write music and poetry in an attempt to offset the suffering that has come before them and will continue to come after.

I can't take this anymore. We were all born into hell. The lucky ones are the ones who are naive enough to roll their eyes at the preceding sentence. I can't believe I was born with the capacity to feel so much, only to be burned and tortured for such a long time as to only have the negative feelings left intact. I can't believe someone with so many hopes and dreams has no grace bestowed upon him, only the same oblivion that everyone is forced to face sooner or later.

I can't do this anymore. I want to scream but no one will listen. I can't believe the level of helpless agony that so many of us are forced to endure. Why. Just fucking why. I haven't felt loved and safe in 10 years, since I was 17. That's not an exaggeration. I can't fucking believe this is my life.

"Anyone else jealous of others happiness? It could be over the smallest thing. Whenever I hear someone talk about hobbies or anything I am just envious of them. I wish I could enjoy things, I wish I could actually have the desire to do anything. It hurts. 

I absolutely hate when people ask me “So what are your hobbies?” “What did you do this weekend?” Shit like that. I have no answer because I just stay in my damn bed whenever I’m not at work. The other day someone asked me “Have you done anything interesting lately?” I just straight up said “No, I’m boring” 

I hate it because it makes people not want to be friends with me. And I get it, why would you want to be friends with someone like that? I don’t blame them. But goddamn I wish I wasn’t like this.

Edit: I fell asleep shortly after making this post, and unfortunately I woke up. I ended up self harming, and I just feel worse. Some of you are very nonchalant about encouraging me to end it... but I am a coward. I can't even self harm enough to bleed all that much. I'm a total wimp. Literally not strong enough to do it of my own accord.

I could sit here and ramble about my fucking woes and horrible life circumstances, but I'm just... tired. Tired of explaining myself, tired of trying, tired of feeling like my heart is being ripped out of me.

To those of you who actually said something nice... thanks, but I've heard it all before. ""It could be worse"", ""I care about you"", ""It gets better""... It doesn't feel like it. Every time I end up feeling ""better"" my depression comes back worse and worse sooner or later. The self harming gets worse The thoughts of ending it all persist.

So.. what I'm trying to say is... I'm unfortunately still alive, and I still wish I wasn't.

Edit 2: I am alive. I've been on meds and I'm in therapy, but I'm looking into intensive outpatient care and will switch therapists once the evaluations I wanted to get done are done. I'm still holding on, somehow. Lots of you have helped. I still wish I didn't have so much pain and anxiety and sadness in my brain and body, but... some of you have inspired me to do something I hope will mean something to you. What that thing is, I'm not entirely sure yet, but it feels good to know people out here might actually want to see it.

Thanks.",depression
"being called lazy, useless, and internet addict is a daily routine for me. before, i had thought that if i told my parents about my depression they would be very supportive and instead feel that it is their fault that i turned out this way.

I was wrong.

My dad constantly asks me why am i always playing games all day, reading ""stupid, useless novels"", and refusing to go to school.

Mu grandma, keeps bothering me and lecturing me about how my phone will turn me blind because i look at it everyday.

My sister always scolds me for being so clumsy and disorderly with my stuff.

My mum is dealing with my dad's manic episode and my sister's upcoming national exam. She doesn't have time to deal with me.

They all know I am depressed. And they chose to ignore that fact and treat me like the depression is all ""in your head"".

I use my phone and games as an escapism. I need to distract myself so I won't constantly think abiut depression.

I am so tired of being called lazy. If I had some more energy to get up and do the stuff I like, I would do it. But everyday I feel like my body is deteriorating, and i am slowly sinking without anything to hold onto.

School's not any better. All of my classmates are nice but I just...can't handle the socializing. I hate being contacted. And I can't get anything into my head. I feel like my brain function is shutting down.

I used to be so good. Kind to others, excelled my studies, can connect with anyone.

"Do you guys ever have intrusive thoughts about what a horrible person you are over past mistakes that nobody even remembers or cares about? Since this pandemic began, I've been experiencing a lot of guilt and remorse over very trivial, cringy stuff I did when I was a kid. Even though I realize how ridiculous this is, my mind still convinces me I am a terrible person, worthless and undeserving of happiness and that I don't deserve to take care of myself.

Edit: Guys, ty, ty, thank you for the support ;-; ❤️!! I just want to quickly say that reading the comments made me feel less alone in my struggle. It breaks my heart knowing others are going through the same thing.

"People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies. UPDATE: So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former.

Original post:
Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

Thanks to everyone for your comments. I’m trying to reply to each one but it’s hard to keep up, so I’m sorry if I miss yours. Remember—you’re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.

"One of, if not the worst things about being depressed, for me, is that I have to force myself to do basic shit. I have to make an effort to maintain my body for example, or just get outta bed. Everything is labored and thought about beforehand. No enthusiasm even for hobbies. Force myself to do them So everything is labor in that way. I don't think people who don't have depression truly understand just how uphill it can seem. When everything has to be forced to be done or it just won't get done. It's exhausting and I'm already exhausted.

A good way to describe it would be everything feels like resistance against the depression. Every action I take as a depressed person is actively going against the depression. Have to fight and resist it and not be consumed by it. And it's exhausting. Always feeling that you are pushing up against something and trying to claw your way out instead of just acting freely without the weight of that.

Every day I am forced to do things I hate, talk to people I hate, go to places I hate and to put on my fake smile and pretend everything is ok. Lately I have noticed that I’m being irritated by almost everything. I just can’t stand it anymore. 
I hate everyone around me, I hate society, I hate this world, myself and my existence. 

I can’t remember the last time I was honest with someone about the way I feel. If I stop acting like I’m ok and someone notices I’m not feeling well, I’ll just say that I’m tired or my head hurts or other shit like that. It’s not like someone fucking cares about how I feel anyway, it’s all fake and pointless. 

I absolutely hate myself because I’m worthless. I’m ugly, I have no talents except being useless and doing absolutely nothing. I can’t even stand looking at myself in the mirror. 

Everything has lost its meaning lately. Does my existence even matter? If I suddenly disappear it would be better not only for me but for the world as well. 
I don’t even want to pursue my dreams anymore. I don’t want to achieve anything anymore. I just want it all to end. 

I have been thinking of killing myself for a while now, everyone will die when they reach a certain age, what does it matter if it’s now or then?

If depression doesn't exist, why do I cry when I glance at myself in the mirror. Why am I isolating myself from family and friends? Why did I cut into my wrists? Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist?

An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. Unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic. My dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didn't exist. He also threatened to kick me out onto the streets, and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse. He just keeps me around cause I have some leftover money from school and he wants it.

&#x200B;

I've come close to suicide a few times. Once when I was 16 and another time when I was 20. Recently it's been on mind, as I'm hitting new lows, but I don't think I could ever do it cause I'm just so in love with my boyfriend. Though, if he ever betrayed me who knows what I'd do. I don't know myself. It feels like I have no one, except him, and I know what men are like after being cheated on before in past relationships.",depression
"My parents told me to kill myself My anxiety ate me alive this morning I felt awful and fought with my parents about it. They told me to kill myself so after panicking I took my jacket and left my home. I went to the nearest bridge and sat there with my legs out of the bridge, over the water. For the first time I was completely calm. Every other time I attempted I was as scared as hell and that was the reason I couldn’t go trough with it. Probably I would have done it this time. Instead a woman grabbed me from behind and took me back to the bridge. She even took me home scared that I would try again. I don’t even know how I should feel. I don’t know anything anymore

Edit: I wrote this post in the heat of the moment but I just wanted to tell you that my parents really love me, it was just a difficult situation I didn’t know how to calm myself and they didn’t know either. It just degenerated but I know they did not mean it, not even a word. When I came back they were terrified that I could have really killed myself, they were really happy to have me back with them.",depression
"If you told me I had five minutes left to live I’d be relieved. Posting this from my second account. 

This year has been the worst of my (26 F)  life. 

My dad died a month ago today due to a pulmonary embolism. I’m devastated. I also had my fourth miscarriage earlier this year and my fiancé left me after cheating on me the whole relationship. 
I’m in school to be a teacher and due to dads death it isn’t going well. 

I’ve stopped talking to friends and told them I’ll talk to them after Christmas. I don’t feel like pretending to be fine to appease them. 

I’ve stopped eating healthy and lost all this weight very rapidly. 

I don’t sleep. I stay up late and wake up early. 

I feel like everyone hates me and I’m a failure. I also feel terribly lonely. I just don’t see light at the end of the tunnel and I’m in a lot of pain. 

I’m not suicidal but if you told me I only had a few minutes left to live I’d be very relieved and I’d go as far to say... joyful.

Edit: thanks for all the messages and awards. Every minute I draw breath is a struggle. I wish life would just be over but thank you all for your help. 

My first three pregnancies were conceived in an abusive relationship non-consensually between 16-19. This time was very much different and fiancé was long gone by time I found out but I was happy my parents and I were happy. 

I bought my dad this precious cup that said grandpa on with foghorn leghorn fishing with the chicken hawk. I’ve lost any hope I had for the future and only the mug and I remain. Thanks for your kind words Internet neighbors I appreciate it.

"Psychologist asked me what my inner child looks like. I drew this. Last therapy session I was explaining to my psychologist about my 'inner Child' (an expression which I hate but it made sense at the time). I described how it felt like she was trapped in a stone room with one high window which she can look out and hear other kids playing outside. She wants to leave the room but she knows it's safe in there and that makes her frightened to leave.

I drew [this](http://imgur.com/a/wIEFpRw) afterwards. I can't draw, but I hope someone else can relate to it.

"Is it alright if I vent? No one here cares... I’m a 50 year old man who is married and has raised two successful daughters. Sounds great, right? I’ve been diagnosed with RA, OA, CPS, Fibromyalgia, neuropathy, PTSD, osteopenia, high blood pressure, anxiety, severe depression, degenerative joint and disc, and a few others. I’m not looking for sympathy, just setting the stage. 
My wife of 22 years was present for each diagnoses, as well as my younger daughter. She promised it would be okay when I gave her a chance to get out and find a better man. I worked 14 to 16 hour days for 27 years trying to do what we needed done. Now, she says I’m lying about the problems. I’m on disability and can barely walk. She calls me lazy and stupid for not working when I really miss being productive. When my problems flare up and I can’t do things, she gets mad. She has now taken $900 that is mine. I’m at a loss. My wife was a wonderful woman. I don’t understand. There are days that I’m tempted to let the depression win and end my life because I don’t want to live like this. I’m done. I apologize for doing this here. I have nowhere else to do this. If you read this, God bless you and thank you. You treat me better than my family.

"feeling depressed at night time is way worse than in the day time Its like all your thoughts and feelings are intensified. you feel more like shit because you know there’s people out there that are probably living there best lives. there’s people going out with there friends, partying, drinking, clubbing, watching movies/shows together, listening to music in there cars and enjoying the vibe with whoever there with, and then there’s you...inside the house...in a dark room...in your bed...alone...with no one to talk to you...browsing the depression subreddit wondering how so many people feel the same way as you.

"You can't kill yourself, think of your family! Yup, no shit. Every time I would ever come out as suicidal, that's always the first thing they say. The crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that I've been struggling in for years. I know they're trying to help, but it doesn't help, it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time. It leaves me with the impression that if I sever ties with everyone to the point where I am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe I'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others. At least that was my impression before I realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions. So even if I get lucky, and my suicide was clean, It will never be painless. So, for now I'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after.

Edit: I sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem.  That makes this statement much, much worse. The people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day. That sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. To people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, I hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group. And I hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out.",depression
"Regular Check-In Post Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. 

If you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.

"I almost feel like I should’ve killed myself a long time ago and now I’m just living out a life that wasn’t meant to happen? I feel like the majority of my life so far was a movie of events just happening all leading up to the final end to the movie of me killing myself.  I would just die and I would never have to get to this part of life; it would just happen like that. but now I feel like I missed that chance and my movie is still going but the rest of the movie wasn’t planned out because it should’ve ended with my death so the story is just improvised, and now i feel even more lost and unmotivated than before. (because in all honestly I feel like I tried so hard with school and activities and work etc as one final push before i would kill myself but then I never went through with it and now I’ve given up trying on work and stuff) I don’t know whether others feel this way, but maybe in another alternate reality I did kill myself at the right time and that’s why I feel so wrong because I didn’t. who knows",depression
"Could 1 person just read this - it's getting harder to pretend I'm okay and I dont know how to keep it up EDIT: Wow, thank you so much everybody I am so grateful, please please comment on people's posts that dont have any comments if you can. Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3

I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. 

My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth.

My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves.

It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together.

School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time.

I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.

Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me.",depression
"I don't know myself outside my mental illness Is hard to think that I can improve and get better when I've had either anxiety or depression since I was 12. I've read some people that have beat depression as 'getting my old self back' but I don't know how that feels like, idk. It's hard to think that I will ever be able to achieve that when there isnt an 'old me' that actually enjoyed life. 

Having some bad weeks lately, thank you if you read this little rant.

EDIT:   God damn I wasn't expecting all this attention. I'm really new to reddit so I'm just, kind of speechless. I've been reading **all** your comments and advice and let me just say thanks so so much to every single one of you. You took the time to answer and help me when I was feeling sad and hopeless. Even if it was to say that you are in the same situation, you made me feel understood and less alone. I will try to be patient with myself and, as some of you said, work to get better so I can 'discover' myself little by little. It's a long, long road, and right now it seems so hard and impossible, but I will try nonetheless. 
I will continue answering all the comments I can, but I wanted to add this first.

"Do you also feel like this, totally neutral and absolutely bored with life, feeling that nothing has real substance and colour ?  

Hello folks, I feel a certain way since years and I try to muffle it as hard as I can but it's getting impossible and I wanna know if you feel like this too, or what is it.

I've always found interest in quite everything and i've tried to do everything around me that I was actually able to (psychologically or physically speaking).  
But I can't get invested in anything I do. Any activities that I do are short and if they go on for too long I get bored.  
I force myself to do quite everythings, I force myself to feel emotions (like happiness when I get a gift or happiness when I win on games) and the only emotions that are spontaneous and ""real"" from me are frustration and absolute void.  
When I don't force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure, I feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life.  
Everything seems washed out and boring, literally everything.  
Nothing stimulates me or give me a feeling of pleasure or joy.  
Nothing really interests me and I feel like i've done everything that I HAD to do in my life and I only see one option now : that it's over !  
(I don't wanna suicide even if sometimes I think about it, I won't do it because I don't want to but it just feels like life is meaningless now and it's the only logical choice)  
I got the checklist done, everything else is purely boring and non stimulating, so I don't really wanna live anymore.  
Because literally everything that I do makes me suffer, even writing this text.  
Because I feel like it's useless and boring.

Is that just depression in a way ?",depression
"Anyone else feel like depression has made you dumb? I feel like I don't think as much anymore, like depression killed all my brain cells. I'm just numb and floating and not interested in anything. I can't remember words very well. Sometimes it literally feels like my head is full of air.

I feel so guilty for having depression when I’ve not really had anything traumatic happen to me and there’s so much evil going on in the world I don’t deserve this life,depression
"My therapist cried in a session and another therapist told me to quit her ASAP I have been seeing my therapist for a few years but just started recently feeling comfortable enough to open up about my past trauma to her. Upon doing so, she cried. She did try to hold it back but eventually she cried then immediately apologized and told me that I remind her of her daughter and she cares about me. It honestly was the first time I've felt love from a parental figure.  

However, during that time I was actually having a mental breakdown. I was reliving my trauma everyday and it impacted my work greatly. My boss was not understanding and my physichiatrist eventually recommended a extensive therapy group with a ""great therapist.""

This therapist was not at all what I expected. She was incredibly into the ""tough love"" approach. She made everyone go in a circle and talk about their most traumatic moments. I have social anxiety and these were strangers so I did not really participate in that. But I did talk about my therapy experience and my coping mechanisms and such. She eventually found out that my therapist cried once in a session. She told me that was ""beyond unprofessional"" and that I should ""drop her immediately."" 

I actually did end up dropping her only to get a horrible experience with another therapist. One recommended by the therapist that told me to drop my initial therapist. 

I was so sad and eventually went back to my initial therapist. I haven't seen anything wrong but I can't get help but feel insecure about my own decision. Am I making the right choice? Is it okay to go to someone cause they feel like a friend you can open up to? Are emotions bad and unprofessional for a therapist to express?

*LIL' UPDATE*

Wow! Thank you all so much for the comments and awards. It was so nice to read all of your experiences, I'm so overwhelmed with happiness rn to not feel so alone!   

I have seen 8 therapists in my life and I have never felt this comfortable with one. It honestly was the first time I haven't regretted telling a professional my personal trauma. Although not everyone agrees with this approach, her emotion ultimately showed me that I have people that care about me and it really helped me in a time when I really just needed compassion.

With that being said, I am continuing to see my empathetic therapist as that is what works best for me. 

Thank you again for all of your reassurance and encouragement in helping me choose what's best for me. I struggle a lot with decision making so I was really in my head about this. Anywho, just wanted to say you are part of a wonderful community here and I hope you all find happiness/peace. I'm not there quite yet, but baby steps are okay.",depression
"My dad told me stop being depressed because it's embarrassing him. Last year On November 21 I attempted to kill myself and winded up in hospital the next day , I was still drowsy from the pills I overdosed on and could barely see let alone hear a thing .
 I was so weak I couldn't even walk , I had to use a wheelchair, I went to the hospital bathroom (still in the drowsy state ) and came back to find both my parents sitting by my hospital bed .

Keep in mind my mom is a single mom and has been raising me for years now , I only saw my day once and at most 5 times a year so I was not expecting him . I got to the bed , sat down and my mom gave me a very worried and concerned look but befire she could say anything my dad open his mouth ...

His exact words were , ""Stop being depressed,  it's embarrassing me and I don't want to deal with your nonsense ."" 
That broke my heart , I knew he didn't care but I didn't think it was that bad , I was still in my drowsy state but the moment he said that I think I might be woken up a little . The rest of the conversation with them was a blur but I just remember being so fixated on what he said to me .

That was the last time we spoke , he didn't even wish me a happy birthday this year . I'm only 14 , he broke what little hope I had of us finally reuniting as daughter and dad , I didn't have alot of hope to begin with but damn.


Edit : Thanks for all the positive comments .I didn't the the post would get as much attention as it did with that being said  I'm thankful , you guys were so nice and supportive in the comments .  

To those who have gone/ are doing through something similar or even worse  ,  I sincerely hope you get better , you are loved and appreciated and from the bottom of my heart I'd like to say that you are cared for and  I'm so sorry if anything makes you feel weak or not good enough .

"I never understood why the suicide rates went up during Christmas time... now I do. I've always had depression, for as long as I can remember. But this year it's getting a bit worse I might say. I'm kinda in a haze, it's all foggy, my brain feels like cotton, I'm numb and in pain. I'm here but at the same time I'm not, I'm not myself anymore. The depression is choking me, the anxiety is killing me. I don't want Christmas to come this year.   
I  have this feeling that I don't want to be here to celebrate Christmas this year. People are nagging me about what I want for Christmas... I have no answer, because I don't need or want anything and I don't want to be here to open them anyway. Whenever I get a present from someone, I just feel guilty. Because trashy people like me doesn't deserve it, I just feel like a burden for everyone around me. I'm a waste of space, waste of oxygen. The guilt of taking up space is getting worse by the minute.   
I've told most people in my family I don't want any presents this year. They don't know it's because of the guilt. I'm tired of all the guilt! Guilt for breathing, existing, for being stupid and just for being me.  
People around me has been decorating for Christmas these past few days, I haven't. I don't care and I don't see the point.  I don't want to celebrate Christmas this year. I see no point. No joy, no happiness, no... nothing.   
Now I understand why people kill themselves around Christmas. 

My lack of will to live is kinda scary. It's never been so deep and strong before. The fact that January is gonna be financially hell doesn't exactly make it better. I don't want to live to experience January. I can't, I can't afford it. I can't handle it! Oh here we fucking go again, my brain is getting on overdrive and running around again.

"I hate it when people say “well occupy yourself” when you’re depressed. People often say to take your mind off depression, go do something.

I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out.

I suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness. Sure that helps me vent but I cannot for the life of me escape myself.

I also have an evil circle hanging over my head. I need to feel this hatred and sadness and shit and bile in my soul to be able to write. If I feel happy, on the rare occasion, I can't write. And if I can't write, I can't perfom.. See my problem? I want to be the embodiment of my art. I want to experience this pain to be able to write and perform it. This comes at the price of wanting to die every single day. How can I escape or deal with my emotions, when I use them to make a living?

&#x200B;

Edit: I am moved by everyones effort to help. I can't do much to thank you but here is a poem that I wrote a while back. It won't rhyme in english but I hope that doesn't bother you.

&#x200B;

You hold the suns warmth in your hand

when you touch me I become your man

to be thawn is not easy

the cold bites and doesn't feel right

if you've been frozen for all these years

a layer of ice to cover the wounds

you melt my heart you melt my soul

unlocks life and a whole new world

I love you with all my power

even though I never told you

&#x200B;

with the sun's rays dawns a new day

but there was something you didn't want to say

for cold winds can troubble a flame

you wanted to tell but not to hurt

when the warmth had gotten so weak

you said that it was I who had ended the day

that the frost and ice had put out your flame

you left no please stay

for a sun needs fuel and a spark

a chill needs only a coffin",depression

"""The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly."" -- F.

"I finally went to see a psychiatrist and he straight up told me I don’t have a mental illness. I’m sorry if I sound mad and this is a rant, I’m fucking furious. 

So after 3 months of waiting, many years of putting all of this off, I finally get to see a psychiatrist. I drove 2 hours to get here, spent 20 bucks on parking, and I was told to fuck off. 

This guy could barely speak English, but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis.  

I’ve been smoking daily for 2 years now, and Ill admit, it is a problem. But I’ve literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life. 

He wouldn’t even let me speak and when I did he was just drawing on his notepad. He would just tell me that it’s cannabis and I need to go to rehab and once I stop smoking I’ll be fine. 

Bitch, I’m not fucking fine. 

There were so many things I needed to talk about, I literally think I have autism, and when I brought it up he didn’t even acknowledge it. I wanted to talk about anxiety issues and ADHD and ptsd, but apparently I have none of those and it’s just cannabis.  

My favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me I just need a mom. I literally responded with, “well no shit, but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that’s not really an option.”

I’m so fucking pissed. My life is literally going to go no where and I’m never going to get help, so this is fucking fun.


Edit, thanks for all the support guys, I’ve got another doctors appointment set up to see a new psychiatrist so that’s cool. 

Please stop upvoting and commenting haha, I never wanted to get this much attention and only wanted the 3 people that usually respond lol",depression

Does anyone else feel like they only staying alive for other people I hate the saying suicide is selfish because no one ever congratulates you for staying alive for others despite how fucking exhausting it is to simply exist. I've been depressed for past several years but one thing I've always had is my family which I'm grateful for and also ashamed to be depressed because how fucking dare I not be happy with all I have. Anyway I've purposely hid this from them because I don't want them to think of me as anything but the class clown type who's always seemingly upbeat and has his life together. The fascade is exhausting. I've wanted to die for a while but simply cannot bear to put my folks through especially my younger brothers who wouldn't even understand. Maybe this is enough maybe this will push me through until I get better. ,depression

It's the fear of failure but no urge or will to be productive.
It's wanting friends but hate socializing.
It's wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely.
It's caring about everything just to abruptly care about nothing.
It's the feeling of feeling everything at once then feeling paralysingly numb.
It's wanting to get help, but subconsciously knowing it won't make a difference because you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, you are just tired of being in the tunnel.",depression

EDIT: Thank you so much for the awards and all the time and care everyone has put into their comments. While I thought it would be comforting, I’m actually sad to see so many people relate to this. I’m sorry you’re all going through this. I hope you’re able to find peace. ❤️",depression

I grab hold to anything I can find, but I'm tired of searching for things to hold on to.

The hurricane is forever stalled overhead. Some days it's stronger than others. But I realize there's nothing that can be done about that.

So I tell myself ""Oh, those people? They're not really friends. They don't really love each other that much. It's just for show. When there's no one recording, they hate each other just as much as everybody does"".

"12 months ago, I tried to kill myself. 3 seconds, that’s how long the EMT says I was gone for.. My body is suddenly getting flashbacks to that moment and it hurts. I took three bottles of various pills in my cupboard, downed a fifth of tequila, and put a pipe to my car’s exhaust into the driver’s side window and cried tears of joy that it was finally going to be over.

I passed out and woke up in the ambulance strapped to a gurney, confused, sobbing, and hysterical. My housemate got home early and found me. I was admitted into the ICU, spent my birthday, Christmas, New Years, etc in the psych ward for three months going through ECT.

My friends can't really get through me and I'm constantly tired. In order for things to change I need to do something, but to do something I need energy... so yeah...

I don't know if these are just symptoms of depression, but I feel so distant from people that I used to consider friends. They never come in contact with me and I can't bring myself to contact them either, and when I do, it's often just short lived conversations or I end up being left on read. My main circle of friends kind of broke off, and now they never seem to plan anything with me. I feel so alone, but at the same time, it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others. As for finding new friendships and relationships, I feel like I've met someone but I find it so hard to trust them and I feel so scared all the time that it's never going to work out or if they're even interested. I honestly feel like I'm not even a priority for them but I feel so guilty and self-absorbed for feeling this way. I don't know if I should tell them because it might make me feel clingy.

"The most depressing part about turning 30 is when you start thinking “this really is my life after all” When you’re 18, you can make mistakes. You have the time to fix them. They don’t define the rest of your life. You have a decade + to build a life for yourself. There is always that hope that one day, things might turn out well for you. There is excitement. Life is full of colour, but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale.

Then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you IS the road you’re now walking down. And all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life.  Nobody is coming to save you or bail you out. 

I would give anything to go back and do things over. But there is no reset button, you can’t start a new save file. All you can do is turn off the game.

For people in their late teens/early twenties - don’t waste a moment. Appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with. They disappear without warning and one day, it will hit you like a fucking dump truck in the chest that you have lost them forever.",depression

"My therapist thinks I'm too depressed for therapy So my therapist that I've only seen two times thinks I'm not a good candidate for therapy. She thinks that I'm too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that I'm going to see a doctor about and re-evaluate in a few weeks.

She didn't think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me. Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total.

After doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. 

I am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. 

I've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. 

I am not a quitter nor will I ever be. 

All I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for? Am I unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start?

"I plan to kill myself tonight with a plastic bag (suffocation) I'm 14
my mom doesn't take my mental health seriously and ignores what I've tried to tell her. And the reason why I want to commit suicide? Because of my life, my family, school. My mom says everyday that I'm useless, dumb, why can't I be like my brother. She says I'm a disappointment, why didn't see listen to the dreams from Jesus about me being a horrible daughter, how she wished she could abort me when she got the chance. My dad doesn't even do anything to stop my mom. My mom earlier this year pushed me on the floor, and choked me because she was really angry. I feel worthless, and pathetic. I have no friends at school, everyone ignores me, and I have zero social skills, how fun. My extended family doesnt even like me, my mom tells them heavily exaggerated stories about me that makes me look like a bad person. I'm failing math because I dont get any of the material, I tried seeking help, but my dad gets fed up with me not keeping up at his learning pace. I'm ugly, and skinny. My cousins make fun of my body, saying how I look like a flat stick. And on top of that, I can't even think straight anymore, suicidal thoughts and urges have basically took over my life. I feel like the odd person always, I feel disgusted with myself. Like I can't even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in. I'm lonely, 0 social life. I've been dealing with this for 5 years, I cant take it anymore. Im burned out. I have no motivation to keep going. And before you say ""Your family will be sad"" I do not care. I am done. Maybe when I die I can finally seek the revenge I deserve. I just want to die, I'm still surprised that I lived to my 14th birthday. My mom says to ""Pray that I get better"" Or that I'm not reading enough of the bible. I'm SICK of it. She says a demon has probably took over me because I feel the way I feel.

"I've told 2 college professors that I am suicidal in less than 3 days of each other and.. I was quite shocked at their reactions. I sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason.

And the second professor, he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well. He was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually.

"I've been left out of everything, and someone actually cared. So, basically, my school is crap.

Teachers don't care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here. I didn't think the students did, until today.

There was an odd number of girls today since one was off, and we had to go into pairs. Of course, none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys. So, I sat at the side and said I was fine not doing it.

However, one of the boys asked why I couldn't go in a three with one of the girls' pairs (if you couldn't tell I'm female, and in my school girls and boys don't like to go together much), but all of them said ""no this is a paired activity""

So he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if I wanted to go in his pair.

He got a detention (just at lunch break) for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by, but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity, and that someone actually cares.

"My girlfriend of 4 years died 2 days ago and I feel alone Growing up I had never really been depressed and always tried to look at the positives, but 2 days ago I watched my girlfriend die.  She was my soul mate, we connected instantly when we met at work. I had currently been in a toxic relationship when we met so we didn't date until a year later. But we instantly became friends and after a little bit of drama we started dating.. but I knew by then that she was the one.  She understood me like nobody else and I understood her.  She was good at everything I struggled with and I was good at everything she struggled with. We never really fought we only slightly bickered from time to time but it was never anything serious.We were planning on finishing college and then we were gonna get married.  But we decided to go visit my family's cabin in the mountains with some friends, and on the way home my truck broke down. We called a tow and as he arrived we all stood in the ditch waiting for him to tow it.   Then a speeding car came rushing in and slid on the ice and hit me and my beautiful girlfriend.  Once I  woke up I immediately rushed to her but she was covered in blood and she wasn't breathing.  I tried to give her cpr but she was already gone and I can't stop seeing her cold lifeless face.  In those few seconds I lost my future and my other half. I feel so alone and don't really want to live anymore. I can't see a future without her in it, the thought never even once occurred to me.Because I know she was truly my soul mate, and I will never find anyone like her. I miss her smile and her goofy songs she would sing, I miss the way she would put her feet in between my legs before bed. I miss how she would force me to brush my teeth at night because I was being lazy. I just miss her so much and don't know what to do.

"Do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years? I'm a sophomore in college right now and I am constantly surrounded by wise people...

They were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. They were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. They were able to make friends without poor social cues.

I had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me. My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. It doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me.

I'm too lazy to write this but basically I feel so bitter. I wish I did more so I could show off my potential but nope, I wasn't certain of myself ever. I'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ): Sigh.

Edit: I have something to add. First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, ""You don't understand!"" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely.

"Casually Suicidal Do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death? You think about the consequences of it and what people's views are on it. Maybe you have even considered suicide. You brush it off, most likely. That is what most people do. People are scared. I am scared. Who would actually want to die though, right? This is what casually being suicidal is. Can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time? I have a fear of death. I always have, always will. How is it that some days I want everything to end, but I don’t at the same time? It's my biggest fear but also my biggest relief, my biggest wish. In reality, I just want the pain to stop. Why is everything so difficult? Sure, you would tell me to go get therapy, go get tested by a psychologist or something. As if that advice means anything. You want to label us, as if everyone feels the same thing, people like this are the same. In some ways, sure, they are. But most people don’t want to die, they want it to stop. What, exactly, do they want to stop? People. People are predictable. What other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts? Even good people turn bad. Everyone is bad. Even me. People tell you to talk to others about these feelings, that it will help. But only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand, and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to. Is that really a good thing? To relate, in wanting to die? Back to my point, what can people do? I can’t call myself depressed, because I’m not sad all the time. I can’t say I have anxiety, because I’m not anxious all the time. It goes on. The point of this paragraph is to say, don’t tell people to ask for advice, or say that you understand what they are going through. I always tell people what I’m going through, they brush it off. Talking about it can help. But only for the right people. For people like me, I don’t exactly know if I have specific mental health to blame everything on. I’m just feeling like this, that’s all.

"I ruined my own life by being an overwhelmingly anxious idiot. Can't go into details too much for privacy sake but I'm really falling apart. My relationship, my friendships, my happiness, all gone. All because I acted upon my own anxieties and panicked. 

I wish I had listened to what people told me to do, maybe my life wouldn't be all broken. 

I want to cry everyday. I want to die everyday. Everyday is a battle between wanting to be a better man for myself and those around me and wanting to die. 

I don't know how much longer I can take this, but I hope I'm still here, for my daughter's sake.

"I'm homeless now Because I ran away from abusive parents. Never thought I'd actually do it but here I am. I don't want to return. There it's pure hell. It's agonizing to live there.

I don't know what the fuck i will do from now on. Guess I'll be what I feared to be the most. That's it.

EDIT: I took the decision on impulse and I realized that it's impossible to do this on this time of the year. I'm too weak so I gave up. I'll try to calculate my possibilities and think through how I can leave this cursed house. I already regret giving up but what can I do. If I can't find any shelter to get away from here I will try to apply for uni dorm in the next semester.

"I feel like depression makes me see things for what they really are I feel like my depression takes away my brains ability to simply ignore all the countless problems in the world. 

The poverty, hunger, abuse, war, corruption... All of which could be significantly reduced if humanity wasn't so selfish, hurtful, weak and idiotic. 

The pointless grind of working terrible jobs just to survive. The futility of going after your dreams because none of them are likely to become a reality. The inevitability of pain and death for you and everyone around you, where the best case scenario is that you die quickly and are the first one to do so.

"Bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide, posting some ramblings here because I feel alone. It's long and I apologise for the length Don't know where to start. But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice

I live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff.

My grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a ""perfect"" ""son"" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way.

As you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly.

My step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. 

I want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over ""no one really cares about you"" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships

But what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with  women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem

All of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. ""No one really cares"" 

I feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult 

I'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from ""I hate myself and want to die"" to ""I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born"". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive",depression

"I drew a comic about my experience with depression. Hey all. A couple of years back I had some very long and intense bouts of depression that seemed to cripple me completely. A significant part of my experience was apathy; I knew somehow that I was in a lot of pain, but I couldn't feel anything most days. When I could, it was anger. I isolated myself from everyone and lost a lot of friends during that period.

I still have a very hard time with depression, although it's been more manageable nowadays. I transferred schools and got engaged to my favorite person in the world. I still feel like garbage a lot of the time but I have to stop thinking that I'm *actually* garbage. I'm trying.

"Seeing yourself getting worse and worse and not caring enough to do anything is the worst part of depression. For normal people with healthy brains (honestly do those even exist anymore?), whenever things in their life are going wrong, they do what they can to fix it and get better. For those of us who are depressed and do not have that luxury, we've lost interest in caring for ourselves.

There's no clear path on how to fix our lives and the chances of actually succeeding are minimal at best. The amount of effort required is too great and we find life and especially our own lives to be meaningless so why bother trying?

I've grown more apathetic towards life and I really can be bothered to care much about myself. I see my mental state getting worse and life passing me by, bit really I just don't care. I find myself unable to relate to others when they talk about their futures because I genuinely don't see one for myself and I'm not interested in trying to build one. Especially when I have no building materials and no way of obtaining them.

This has to be the worst part about being depressed. It's an illness that makes you not care enough to get help and better yourself leading to a slow decline with endless sadness and misery while your physical health worsens. If that isn't the scariest illness then I don't know what else is.",depression

"Called the suicide prevention hotline for the first time ever I actually felt suicidal today. Really and truly.

I haven’t told anyone I know and don’t think I will.

I’ve found that being vulnerable with some of the people who I’m supposed to be closest with only gives them more ammunition to hurt me.

And the ones I do trust, well I don’t want to feel like a burden on them.

But, it helped so much. Honestly.

Maybe it’s kind of fake cuz it’s their job and they’re trained to be empathetic and understanding, but it felt SO GOOD to have someone to listen and care.

To give a fucking shit that I am dying inside and so goddamn overwhelmed with almost all the aspects of my life.

I cried so so much. I hid in the closet of my bedroom for some privacy and just poured my all my pain and worries out to the kind lady on the phone.

She comforted me and showed me kindness and concern and that felt so fucking good to just have someone listen.

She said she’ll call in again to check in on me and that feels nice.

Please use the suicide prevention hotline. I was teetering on the edge.

"Knowing that suicide is always an option gives me a lot of comfort. Am I weird? How far down that depression rabbit hole am I? I don't have a lot to add. I'm depressed, I guess? This has been going on for decades. I don't know anymore. Am I really depressed anymore, or has it turned into something else? I hate being awake. I wake up every day in a state of shock, overcome with dread. I sleep as much as possible, but I have always had insomnia, so I only get a good night's sleep every 2-3 weeks. I snap awake as soon as I start falling asleep. I've tried medication, therapy, and jesus, but nothing has helped. I recently realized that living with my father is a huge source of stress and anxiety for me. He's emotionally and mentally abusive to me every day. I am moving out soon, which is great (I hope), but I am not expecting all my problems to magically disappear. Despite it all, I am working hard to get a good education and build a better life for myself. Why? I honestly don't know. Because it's expected of me, I guess? What do I want out of life? To be happy, of course! But we all know that ""happy"" isn't realistically achievable. Life is never perfect, so I guess I am aiming for something more modest, like contentment. To me, contentment would be a quiet simple life with very little stress. Not a lazy life, per se, but one where there is little or no pressure on me to do things I simply don't want, and don't need, to do.

"I will never understand how people can live and be happy Life is just objectively bad. Everything seems to be literally designed to bring you down. Even our own bodies are designed to keep us from being content. Think about drugs that make you feel good, eventually your body will reach a point where it needs more and more to reach the same effect. Until you overdose and die. You try to set up goals, you complete them and keep seeking more. You get money, you want more. People say practice graditude, for what? Why should I live a life where I constantly need to remind myself of trivial good things when everything is basically objectively bad? Your loved ones eventually die. You die. People kill each other on a daily basis. Do horrible things to each other. You work until you die. When you are young you have energy and time but no money. When you are an adult you have money and energy but no time. When you are old if you are lucky you have money and time but no energy and most likely riddled with sickness and lost most of your loved ones. Life is always out of balance to kick you down. The only way you can possibly live a nice life is if you are so rich you can just do whatever you want without working and help the ones you love to do the same. What are the odds of that?

Edit: I'm referring to having a normal and healthy coping mechanism, which is not easily achieved for people with mental illnesses. Don't get me wrong!

You can have your own definition of whats the norm for you in terms of personality, your likes and dislikes, your worldview etc, thats completely fine and up to you!",depression
"“JuSt Go tO ThErApY” I see this here and other subs a lot. People vent about how shitty their lives are going or how they’re feeling (honestly; is anyone having a good time right now?). And the answers are usually: go to therapy. On the one hand, yea therapy is good for mental health shit. But it’s not that easy to actually get in. Especially in my country.

It took me a *year* to find a therapist that wasn’t booked and was open before 9 and after 5. Which was a non starter because lo and behold offices and jobs tend to want you working for them between 9am-5pm so you can’t go gallivanting off to talk to your therapist for an hour. Finally found one and come to find out my insurance won’t cover them. Going to this therapist costs me $99 a week. That’s more than I spend on groceries. I make a decent amount and haven’t yet been sacked because of covid but not many are as lucky as I.

Tldr: therapy isn’t easy to get into and isn’t cheap. “Go to therapy” is not a solution many people can take.",depression
"Not suicidal, just don’t want to live Anyone else feel like this? You don’t want to end your own life, you don’t have the urge to do it. You just hate life. You wish you didn’t have it. You wish you didn’t exist. It’s a strange thing. Numb.",depression
"I feel beyond suicidal Anybody else have this? Suicide just feels completely pointless. Infact, everything does. People try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to ""be practical"" and to ""stop being dramatic"" when you're not even showing any emotion the first place and all you're doing is lying there like a dead fish. Killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that can't be fixed and even then suicide doesn't do anything except cause more pain to people. Not even dying seems appealing anymore. At this point I just want to lie in bed and sleep. And keep sleeping. And keep sleeping. But I can't even be afforded the option of giving up. If I do, people tell me I'm selfish and stick pitchforks in me. I ask why and the best answer I get for ""keeping going"" is just ""because you have to."" and then people get angry when you press them further because they can't really think of a reason either. It's just a blind desperation to survive we all have, like we're just that important. That need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me, and so has the need to die. I'm stuck here in this place and all I want to do is block it all out. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed to piss. We keep going because we have to. But nobody ever tells me why.

Edit: Wow 1.3k upvotes and an award? This is the first post I've ever made here on this sub and you've all made me feel really welcome so thank you very much. I'm glad so many people get it.

"I’m always amazed at how much energy healthy people have. When I wake up after 8 hours of decent sleep I’m still exhausted. All day, everyday. Not just “tired”. Exhausted.

“Drink water and eat healthy!” again, I can’t even get out of bed.

Now I'm not looking for any praise because this is something that every adult should do, but I've literally been stuck as too lazy to even take the trash out to the curb except for like once a month. By no means was it a neckbeard den, but it was pretty gross.

I swept, mopped, folded all of my and the wife's laundry, and finally took down the Christmas tree (I know it's May...) amongst other stuff. I'm going to go do some yard work now!

I'm sorry, I really didn't know where else to share because my family thinks I have it together as they never visit, and it would sound ridiculous if I told them how proud I was of something that should be a weekly routine.

Had counselling since then and so much exercise, socialising and growing. Made me feel a lot better about the current funk i've just worked through.

""theres so much to live for""

okay thats just guilt trippy, and either way not everyone has loved ones/support systems just because you do janet 

""just exercise and drink water""

omg...thanks 🤩 /s

""what if something amazing and life changing happens that wouldn't if you died?""

yeah ive been carrying on that hope for years and here i am 

""just put yourself out there""

ive tried, so many times. part of the issue in the first place is that it usually never goes anywhere, and because of my mental health and abandonment issues people are usually driven away. also i completely lack the ability to maintain long term relationships, and have no idea what a healthy one is like in the first place. of course thats all assuming i cant get myself out of bed in the first place, find the social skills i dont have, and stop being an anxious little bitch. 

""god-""

shut up. i respect your religion but please shut the fuck up.

my ability to choose seems to be locked. should i put it in rice, turn it off and on?

Why does depression and anxiety make it so fucking hard to tell if people actually like you? Seriously- I can’t tell even if I’ve known them forever. Do they like me? Or are they just too nice to tell me how much they don’t. Today is a bad day and I’m just obsessing over everything.,depression

"You ever get asked the ""where do you see yourself in five years?"" question in a job interview or something and have to stutter because ""probably not alive"" is the knee-jerk response? First off, what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway.  What do you want to hear as the interviewer when you ask that question?  That I'm indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that I'm ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit?  Fuckin' hell, man.

Undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it, all depends on the person.  I suppose I'm the sloth suicidal.  I've tip-toed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and I can't help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time.  Yet, when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is ""well, don't be alive anymore"", the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone I leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint I have for seeing myself out of my life.  Sounds rather counter-intuitive, but I'd rather my last thoughts be more ""you gave it a go, you're not doing anything wrong, you do you, kiddo"" and less ""hey, you're a tremendous asshole for this, I hope you know that.""

I can comfortably say I'm not doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or this year or even the next, but I genuinely feel like that's how I'm going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit.

Don't even really know what I'm trying to say here, but do you ever feel like this?  Like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of, but for whatever fucking reason just can't make any sort of move?

"I think my life is destined to end in suicide My depression never goes away even though I've cycled through different therapists and medication for 7+ years now. Everything is much worse than before. The slightest inconvience makes me think of ending it all. I've tried 3 times and obs failed :D. I'm only 20 and I feel like an old man who has seen it all. I have had insomnia since I was a child. I can't sleep for days sometimes. It is fucked. And when I do sleep I sleep like 18 hours and still feel tired. It is very hard to keep up with my studies with this. Oh and I'm not in college but still trying to finish high school. It's not going well. I have no job and right now have about 50 bucks to live until january, after I payed my bills. I have no friends, strained relationship with family (basically just my mom, only child, father left when I was a baby) no one to talk to. No one cares about me. It's been like this all my life. Never had a single good relationship with anyone.

This all sucks but is not the why I think I will kill myself . I KNOW all of the things I could make my life go better but I just don't see it ever happening since my mental state never gets better. I've already experienced one psychotic episode. I feel constantly on the edge of sanity. I simply can't live like this much longer. There is no help for me i've tried the ""help"" so many times already. I think I will not make it to my next birthday. But that's alright, it will be a good thing for the world. I already have violent fantasies of just going to a mall and shooting people. It's best to end it before I harm somebody else. I'm not a good person and I wont be missed.

I didn't think it would get this kind of response, it was a nice suprise to wake up to since I really didn't believe there was anyone that cared anymore.

After warnings and explanations, they said they would cooperate then persisted in doing exactly what we told them was against the rules. After we resorted to banning the account, something we very rarely do here, they announced that they were going to escalate their rule-breaking behaviour.  The sort of person who claims to want to help, but ignores a community's rules while claiming to want to follow them is, in our regretful opinion, exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable OPs need to be protected from.

"Makes friends -> get close, really get to know them -> alienate them slowly with your issues -> get abandoned yet again several years into another good friendship that you hoped would last a lifetime -> repeat This pattern has been repeating for over a decade for me.

I'm just so sick of it. I thought I'd broken this cycle, but it's rearing it's head again. I'm being told to just make new friends, but what happens a couple of years from now when they get sick of me too and I'm right back here, wallowing in my own feelings of abandonment, isolation, not belonging, etc. all over again?

It just reinforces for me that I don't belong on this planet, that as soon as somebody knows the real me, our relationship (whatever it's nature) is on borrowed time. That I'm just going to be flitting like a pariah between groups I never quite seem to fit into, spending the rest of my life pursuing validation wherever the search takes me next, until finally, almost mercifully, it ends.

"When you reach that point where “what’s wrong?” no longer has an answer When there’s no longer any specific thing that you can pinpoint as the reason you’re feeling the way you do.

When you don’t even fully understand it yourself. Why can’t you just be happy if nothing specific happened to ruin your mood?

When you’re so used to feeling depressed that you don’t even know how to feel happy during the moments that are supposed to make you happy.

When the few things you had in life that you used to enjoy either become dull to you or impossible to motivate yourself to do.

When it starts to seem pointless to even try accomplishing anything because you know that no matter where you are in life you will probably still be depressed.

When you can no longer stand speaking to the people you love because it’s either pretend to be happy or ruin their whole mood/day and make them worried about you.

When even the most simple conversations are very hard to get through without being triggered by something and wanting to break down.

When it gets to the point where you have heavily considered abruptly cutting the people you love out of your life because interacting with them is becoming exhausting and you would rather them think you’re an asshole for isolating from them than to give them the even more painful truth about where your mind is going and what you think is inevitable.

When the overall feeling of not having anything in your life that makes you happy anymore starts to be far more painful in your mind than actually having negative things happen to you.

How do you even answer “what’s wrong?” when it’s both not anything and every single aspect of your life at the same time

"I’m so embarrassed I can’t envision a future for myself that’s it’s affecting my relationships I’m envious of everyone around me. Even envious of the old me. I used to have goals and aspirations. Now all I do is sleep. I used to be smart, bright, had so much to say about the world and would easily slip into witty banter with my friends. Now I’m slow, everything I say feels scripted, every movement I make feels stiff, everything I do feels fake. I feel like an imposter. I got accepted to great colleges, attended one and ended up flunking three semester due to this void inside me. I was so embarrassed of the shell of a human I had become, hollow, purposeless, no goals, just empty. Even though I’m seemingly “much better” I’m still the same. Even when things are good, this void never leaves. When it gets quiet inside me, that void grows. I don’t know if I can continue living like this. I just want to feel normal. I’m talking to this guy I really like but he’s so motivated with such a bright future ahead of him, and he likely thinks the same of me based on what I told him, but those things I said aren’t me at all. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I’m constantly questioning how I’m going to survive if everything keeps getting heavier and I keep getting tired and nothing has meaning anymore.

"11yr old son came to me and said he had planned to shoot himself. Driving to soccer practice my son told me he had planned to sneak into my room and (somehow) unlock my safe and shoot himself. Then went on to say he no longer wanted to do it.  He cited rejection from kids at school as the main source of his sadness, but as his father I have a hard time not assigning blame to everything I can think of that I might have done differently. I have personally had suicidal ideation issues since about 12 but never gone as far as a plan to actualize those thoughts. Feeling as though I passed a torch but also telling myself that it is most likely other factors ( my therapist agrees with the latter). Any advice for helping a pubescent 11yr old, and not blaming myself for everything ?

Edit: update and more info. 
You guys this chat has been amazing! Thank you to everyone involved and that took time to post! Thought I would give more background to the situation that people have asked or talked about.

We learned he was having suicidal thoughts from his school. My wife is a fifth grade teacher and received a call from my sons school that he had texted another student and mentioned he was going to kill himself. The student told their parent the parent contacted the school.  My wife immediately left with her school counselor to pick him up and take him to her school. He wasn’t saying much and didn’t give any specifics to my wife about plans, just that what she was being told was true.
      That night is when he told me of his plan but that he didn’t want to do it anymore. My therapist said it would be a good idea to get the whole family involved for support, so we also had a family meeting with his two sisters letting them know what was happening. It went amazing and everybody had a good cry and let him know how much he meant to them and how much we would miss him. I also moved my gun safe out of the house to a family members.
   The next day my wife took him to school my with her and went to see the school counselor/licensed therapist. They talked about what was going on made a safety plan and talked about coping mechanisms for him.  He will be having sessions with her regularly. 
   We now have open communication with him about his anxiety/depression levels. His thoughts of suicide he says have been minimal. He did tell me during one talk “I don’t want to die, but my brain keeps telling me I do”. He’s an very emotionally sensitive and has always been. He takes things personally and rejection is amplified because of this. 
   I feel we have moved into a better space around the situation, and he is doing well. 
   Thanks again for all the responses, they have been validating and uplifting. You all are amazing and thank you for the support !",depression

"I don't want to kill myself, I just don't want to exist My life feels to be falling apart. I don't know how to explain it other than my limbs all being stretched and physically unraveling and dislodging. 

My brain is rot and my insides are rot. Rotted goop. 

I don't have a purpose in life, I have no dreams in life, I'm wasting away the prime of my life. I dive into my eating disorder to cope and get high sometimes and self-harm. 

Therapy for me of 3 years failed and my therapist took an indefinite leave so that went down the drain. My psychiatrist is cool but I've tried 15+ meds and nothing really works. 

I can't figure out this big issue in my life and I repeatedly obsess and ruminate over it with no answers or solutions as I sit paralyzed in fear. 

I think I just realized today that my depression has been getting worse in ways I didn't recognize as I've gone up on this new medication. Talking to people has become more of a chore than it used to be. It gets on my nerves to have to speak up or when anyone talks to me. I don't care to talk about anything I'm interested in anymore. I used to at least have some interest in certain topics, but now I just don't care and I don't want to talk to anyone. Every word said to me or that I say is a fork on a chalkboard. I have to psych myself up to raise my voice and speak. 

I don't care about doing things I used to do with friends. Well, I care less, anyway. Or more like I'm just indifferent. Numbed out... I still care. But it doesn't feel as...there? It feels like I'm wearing emotion-canceling headphones. It's all still there, but it's so muted. 

I can't stay awake during the day at work at all. Worse now than before. I find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets...

I've lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability. And I just don't care anymore. It makes me feel bad but I don't care enough to do anything about it at all. I realize I suck at my work but so what. I've already failed, I still fail. So what... 

My motivation was already shit but now it's more like I don't care... I used to be upset that my motivation was gone, angry about it, in a sense? And now I kind of just don't give a shit. I recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure it's still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because I don't feel the anger at myself as much. 

Occasionally I have bursts of extreme emotion, like yesterday I had a MAJOR anger rage moment where I had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming, slamming things around and knocking things over and self-harming viciously in a frenzy. 

Some days I burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and I try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities I do once I go home from work. 

Every day is a repeat of the day before. Week by week. All the same. It's Monday, then suddenly Friday. Then the weekend. Then Monday...repeat. I don't care about any of it. Monday, Wednesday, Sunday...whatever. All the same. 

The best part of my day is when I get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 2-3 hours. That's literally the most I look forward to. And even that is starting to fade out. 

Everything is faded. Everything is muted. At random times I explode, but then the monotony sets back in and I find myself almost in a stupor of some kind. 

My life is meaningless and I want it to be over. I don't want to commit suicide, I just want to not exist.",depression
"I hate how ""Go to therapy"", and ""Start exercising"" are thrown around like they are a magic pill. Don't get me wrong many have benefited from this, but how many haven't?

It seems that for everyone these don't work they are followed with find a better therapist or working out will just release endorphins to make you feel better or some shit.

If only I had kept all the wasted money on therapy to pay 10 escorts instead, I'd be much better. Going to therapy just made me feel worse, no matter how many different I went to, and I tried group therapy once I felt better(which surprise surprise I got better when I wasn't going regularly to therapy) but that was a big mistake, group therapy fucked me up more, it just made me realize I'm actually even more alone in what I'm going through.

To sum up what was heard in therapy, ex promiscuous people who want love but regularly have sex complaining how they hate who they married and cheat on them acting like they understand the sturggle of a late virgin( I was 23 back then).

Oh and the workout part?

Instead of punching my head and hurting, I now punch myself and see stars and get fucking dizzy, working out just made me stronger not happier, endorphins don't hit me, I rest between sets punching my head.

All this stupid advice thrown everywhere made me even more miserable.

And the worst is how many act like they care about feelings but they're just virtue signalling, aka 99.9% of reddit.",depression
"Boyfriend finally succeeded in taking his life Sunday My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding...

He begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. 

He sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. 

He would say to me ""if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die""

I had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back.

He wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone.  I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered

He was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life.

"What's the point in asking for help if no one actually cares? I did everything right today. I gathered my thoughts. I talked to my best friend. And then I finally went to my husband and told him everything. The suicidal thoughts that have gotten worse over the past two weeks, that I think I'm experiencing delusions and paranoia, that I'm genuinely scared for my safety.

And all I really got was a ""we'll get through this"" and that was it. I mentioned possibly needing to go to the ER or look for an in-patient facility to get help because of how rapidly this was progressing and he told me ""but what if it financially ruins us? What then?"" And I just stopped. It's cheaper to bury me than it is to give a single fuck about me and help me get treatment. 

I did everything right. I fucking begged for help. But it's not that serious until you actually kill yourself and by then it's too fucking late.

"My mom died yesterday My mom died yesterday night at around 12 am. She killed herself. I can only assume she has schizophrenia. The previous 2 weeks of her death, she was acting totally different, nothing of herself. She was going on about God (she was never religious) and how if we don’t believe in him we are going to hell. It all began from when she was dating this guy Joseph, and when she came home that night she was totally different. 

I now live with just my dad and sister, and all to remind I am just 16. It really hurts she is dead. All I can think about it her death. I cry off and on and some moments I feel fine then others times I feel numb. 

My family is being supportive- but none of them understand this pain. They remind me “it wasn’t her” I know it wasn’t her. My mom would have never done this to us. It doesn’t change the fact my mom is selfish for killing herself. 

I can still hear the gun shot in the bathroom. It hurts to even go into the bathroom to even touch any of her stuff. I mourn with happy pictures of her- still painful to think she would change so fast.

I looked through notebooks of hers, she used to write like it was her life. She wrote lists and lists of things to do, chore lists, grocery lists, activity lists…etc. it was never ending. 

My mom was always full of life, always ready to take on what life gave her. She never considered suicide. 

The night of when she killed herself she was preparing us all night. It hurt to hear her talk like that. She had cuts all over her body and bruises on her thighs from the 48 hours she disappeared. That morning she came home naked and wrapped up in blanket- apparently walking around the city.

I'm old now. I look back and I don't remember ever growing up. I have 2 DWIs, an entry level job still, no college degree and I live at my mom's house with her fiance who I can't stand.

Any money I make I either spend it on video games or shopping and I racked up over $30k in debt.

Nonetheless, I am grateful to each and every one of you, and each and every one of your words. For the first time in months, I do not feel so alone. Thank you.

Despite all the years of meds and therapy and crisis counseling and being told ""things will get better, you're a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patience""-I can say that, with less than six months until I turn 40, I feel no less depressed than the day I was hospitalized, at age 12, for trying to kill myself via starvation. I can say honestly that at that point, I had absolutely no trauma in my life. My parents did nothing but love and care for me. I just so happen to have a ""depressed"" brain...and the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening.

I was able to make it through high school because I went to a charter school specifically for kids with ""emotional disturbances"", but I only made it halfway through college before I had another full-fledged episode of depression and had to drop out (I was walking out of classes because I needed to cry for no reason).  I still lived at home, and about a year later my parents told me I need to work. The only job I could do, one that allowed me to come and go as I please, and take time off when I needed it, and still be able to support myself, was stripping. In the meantime I was violently raped by a ""friend"" of mine. I couldnt't deal with it, so I just went to work the next day like nothing happened, with a tampon up my ass so I wouldnt bleed everywhere. Supressed it as long as I could, until again I woke up and decided I wanted to die. Began therapy a few years later...last I saw he was happily married with children. My fucking rapist got the life I wanted and never had.....

While I was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing, after 7 years I was vomiting before shifts, And my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as I was dancing. So, I decided I was mentally well enough to try school again, and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training. I spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience, and finally I got a full-time gig with benefits. All the while noticing that my boyfriend still didnt seem into marrying me, it had been 6 years-he finally told me ""we are not financially stable yet"". Even tho he made over $100,000 a year...but alright.

Turns out, he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender! I googled his email because I had forgotten his Amazon name, and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me. His reaction was to first say "" I didnt think you'd ever find that"" (well, use a different handle than the one you always use next time), then to tell me that I needed to move out. Told him I didnt have the money to move out. He said he would pay for the deposit, but when I found a place-he couldnt produce it. Finally told me he didnt want me to leave after all,, we can work on this, blah. Until six months later, when he finally admitted-after 8 years-that he didnt want to marry me, ever. I just wasnt a good enough ""homemaker"". I finally asked for help from my one rich aunt, got the deposit, finally moved out..

While in the meantime, I had been promoted to head PT and trainer for new staff; despite the heartbreak at home, I actually had a job with a prestigous title (for me) and an actual, successful career. I was making enough to pay rent, and was on track for another raise...

Until 2 weeks later. When I was fired over the phone, because one front desk worker said she ""heard"" me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike. Seriously. Never in one million years would I have ever even thought of doing such a thing, but you know...she was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me. That was enough for her to make sure I never worked there again...I was never accused once of jerking someone off when I was a goddam STRIPPER............

Of course with no job and no income, I was given one month's notice to move out. I found a cheap room, and was able to get some work at an old colleague's new gym. I didnt have a lot of hope for the future, but I still had a little.......

And then, I got Covid and almost died from it.

It's been six months and I'm still too weak to walk let alone train, too much brain fog to really do any sort of work, and only have two weeks of unemployment (that I had to fight for) left. I have no money and no job. No man has ever decided I was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with. My own body has become a shell of itself, and the hypoxia from Covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it, has made my depression 1000x worse. I tell people I need help, physically and mentally, but all I have to do is say Trump could have handled this better-and they basically tell me I should kill myself because saying mean things about Trump hurts their feelings. Or, they're just so ""tired"" of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit, they just don't care about me or my health anymore. Because you know, people need indoor dining but they don't need me....

These are people who claim to love me, saying these things. This is my support system saying these things to me........

Can anyone here honestly say, if they were me, they would still have hope that ""things will get better""? I'm not doing another 40 years of this. And since Covid didn't kill me (though it came so close I was on oxygen for 6 days)-I'm nearing the point where I just have to do it myself.

These last few months have been a blur, I can only really recall a few days in detail. I miss the old me, she had so much potential. She had so many friends, she could actually read a book without being overwhelmed, she looked healthy  and prettier. Now I can’t even move out of bed. I just lie there waiting for someone to text me, but it rarely happens now because either people hate me now or I’ve pushed them away. I don’t even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch Netflix now. My housemates don’t even notice when I don’t leave my room for a week. Even my mother said this depression is making her life a misery. I used to be so full of life, but that seems like an eternity away, such a distant memory now. It feels like I have no one now and I have no energy to even move, let alone do anything slightly productive.

"I think acting depressed around people was a mistake No one gives a shit lmao. Unless you have a very special person who's very close to you, whoever notices you're acting off will not want to help, because you're not fun to be around, and in the end you'll just lose connections.

Truth is, you're way better off if you force a smile on your face. If I had known this before, I feel like I might have had more and better relations with people that I would have liked.

Don't get me wrong, I think its important for people to talk about their depression and be true to themselves. But it's just simply futile to mope around depressed around your peers since that's just gonna insure that no one's ever gonna talk to you, its a terrible alternative. So ""give in"" if you want to help yourself.

EDIT: okay, I was wrong. I really should not have gotten this many upvotes. I know no one is gonna see this since I'm editing after like a month, but I was wrong. 

Talking to people helps so, so much. Its just, you gotta find the right people, or you gotta build a friendship with someone to eventually be able to talk about your depression. Its true that forcing a smile on your face will probably help you to build these kind of friendships, and its true its not a good idea express your depression to randoms just like that.

 But I just want to say, don't bottle up your feelings forever. Do what you must to create friendships with people that enable you to do this. Often forcing a smile helps for this. But dont do this forever.",depression

"Six Years Ago Today I Tried to Kill Myself January 9, 2015 I tried to kill myself.  Today, I am in an even worse position than I was.

I don't want to die now, but God, I can't help but think how much better things would have been if I was successful 6 years ago.  My son wouldn't have to grow up in a broken home.  I wouldn't be crying every single day.  I wouldn't be trying to finish school when I can barely function.  My body wouldn't feel like it was shutting down.  There would be none of this suffering.  I guess what I'm saying is this living thing was only worth it because I got a child out of it.  I got to know the real love for my baby, and now I'll never ever kill myself because I have him and he will need me forever.  Which coincidentally means I have to suffer forever until I die naturally.  :( Sorry, just in my feelings today.  I want to celebrate my 6 more years of life, but I just can't.  There's nothing to celebrate about living a life like mine.  Maybe I don't think positively enough.

I don’t take any medication, although I have a bottle of SSRIS still sitting in my cabinet prescribed to me months ago. I’ve always tried fighting through this mentally, but should I take them?

But I had to cut my hours because I had a breakdown. I find it hard to make it into uni, my attendance is awful. I'll flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house.

I remember being sad when I 12 and thinking it was normal. 10 years later, nothing has really changed. I can recognize now how much I mean to some people now, which makes it even harder. It makes me wish I killed myself when I was more naive and selfish. I love the people surrounding me and they support me but I can't seem to be happy. I can't help but feel like everything that goes wrong around me is my fault and that there is no way to fix it. If anyone reads this, thank you for taking the time.

"Sometimes when I pretend to be happy I actually think my mood gets better It's really weird.

Maybe you can pretend so long that you can actually get happy. Sounds dumb but hey, trying to grasp every little straw here.

Edit: It's crazy reading how many people can relate. Thought I was being quite alone with that. Thanks for all of you sharing your thoughts. I guess at some point you are just so low down in that hole, that you seriously try anything to make it go away, even if it means, needing to force yourself through 3 hours fake laughing until for a moment you feel good, only for it to be taken away as soon as you have a moment alone to yourself and you would gladly collapse onto the floor and sleep for days",depression

"30’s but never got to build a life Is there anyone else in their 30’s who have been mentally unwell their whole life and have no job, resume, partner, kids, money, essentially dropped out of society and dependent on others to even drive places? Bonus points if your interests are ‘young’ ie anime, gaming, clinging to things from your childhood like Harry Potter and 90’s cartoons?

I really struggle to accept myself. Anxiety and OCD robbed me of hitting any adult milestones and I fear nobody my age will ever relate to me and I’m so sick of therapists trying to be a cheerleader and telling me how much I have to offer when I objectively don’t have anything to offer, cannot function and don’t even feel my age",depression
"I feel like I have to at least try to kill myself before anyone takes me seriously. (17f) This is long and I feel like I’m attention seeking for even writing this, but it’s how I feel. I could never actually do anything, but I’m tired and don’t know what else to do.

Everyone in my life seems to think that just because they don’t see me crying 24/7, I’m not depressed. But when I do end up opening up and crying, they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that I feel horrible for even trying to express anything. In result, I usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best. 

Thankfully, somedays I’m numb and can’t feel anything at all. 

My mom who I love dearly, feels that because I don’t pay any bills and don’t go to work, there’s absolutely no reason why I should be depressed. Which makes sense I guess, but my brain apparently doesn’t agree lol. 

I zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble. I’m weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday, being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and I hate myself for it. I’m occupying valuable space in their class, and for what? I feel like I’ll never get caught up. I just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that they’ll leave me alone, a thought that I’ll most likely never act on. Every time I look at my work, I get incredibly nervous and can’t think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me. 

My mom is disappointed in me and no matter what I do or say, she doesn’t believe me and I end up giving up in the end because I feel like nothing. I look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years. I feel like I try so hard, but there’s no evidence to support it. I really wish I could do more, but I can’t, I try to force myself, but I can’t get much done and I don’t know why. I’m a terrible student, dumb, useless, and can’t complete work on time. I’ve had no motivation for my work or anything else (like washing my hair or getting out of bed) completely disgusting, I know. 

I also have no friends. Normally, people exaggerate and say they have “no friends,” but at least have one or two. I have none. No one to talk to or confide in. I’ve never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety. No one cares. No one’s ever cared.

I struggle completely alone and have for seven years. I’ve lost interest in everything I used to love, and it hurts so much. I think about killing myself almost everyday, but I’m a coward and would never do it. 

I’ve asked in the past about seeing a therapist (covid makes the process even harder), but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said ‘fine, but she’d have to pick up extra shifts to afford it’ and that she didn’t understand why I couldn’t just talk to her because we’re close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues. 

I know she was just frustrated, but it’s statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something, so that I wouldn’t have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment. 

It won’t be until I finally do something actually harmful, physical, and visible (my current “self harm” which I don’t do often, isn’t) that I might get help. If I can even be helped. But I won’t and probably never will. 

I feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time. A complete failure. And although I try to be as selfless as I can, I appear and feel like a selfish, ungrateful brat. I don’t have a bad life and my parents are great so why do I feel this way? There have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better, but I kid myself every time. Each year it somehow gets worst. I don’t really want to die, but hate my entire existence and want to get away. 

Also, I know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny. I’m sorry for bothering you all. I didn’t know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent. Thank you if you decided to read this.


Edit: I’m typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this. Thank you all for being kind and giving me advice, I’m eternally grateful. I feel less alone now. It felt really nice to finally vent, I’m staying strong and am not going to let depression win. I thought about deleting this, but if it helps someone I’ll leave it up :)",depression

"Anyone else's depression going into overdrive with the recent seasonal changes? I was doing great all summer. Wouldn't even say I was depressed just a few weeks ago. But with the clouds, coldness, late sunrises, and early sunsets, I can feel things starting to spiral. Particularly, I seem to have lost the ability to fall asleep at the right time or sleep through the night. My schedule is all shifted, and I'm basically just getting sleep in chunks at random times. My mood is reflecting my poor sleep.

I don't know if it's SAD or if the light changes are screwing with my circadian rhythm, but I don't like it.

I think depression for me tends to be a very physical affair. Body pain, muscle tension, sleep disturbances. It always seems like this stuff comes first. My mood issues are more insidious. I'm generally pretty rational and emotionally reserved, and don't tend to feel emotions super strongly in one way or another. So it sneaks up on me..a slow, creeping apathy and anhedonia. I tend to get pretty deep into it before I realize how bad things have gotten.

Think I'm going back on the Zoloft.",depression

"My dad is gone... forever This is so hard for me to talk about so I’m just gonna start. Sorry for the run on sentence and the mistakes. 


My dad died last week, on Friday actually. I have been trying to be so strong but it is so hard and I know he would be upset I’m needing this help but honestly I just need any supportive words. He was with his best friend and they got a call for a big contract (my dad and his roomate are electricians, my dad is 63 and retired but still helps his roomate our) my dad left the shop to go to the bank to pull out some money. He was 10 steps from the cross walk but he thought he could make it jay walking accross a 4 lane highway. The light was red and there was a big semi truck blocking the 2 lanes after the meridian. He tried to walk in between the semi and it’s trailer and the light turned green. I know all of you can imagine what happened next. I feel so fucked and so sad my dad has a good 15-20 years in him, he was healthy and happy. A little skinny from beer and coffee but he wasn’t no lazy old man. I have 3 brothers (27 year old,24 year old, 19 year old (me), and my little brother is 16.)
I just had a kid and I’m already so stressed about that cuz it was a little unexpected. And last my dad knew was it was going shitty and we were getting ready to go to court. I have been seeing him everyday since my son was born. I never even got a picture with my dad and my newly born son. Im also so worried about my mom because she gets like this over if she looses a pack of smokes. I don’t know how she is ever gonna be okay again. I don’t know if I’ll ever be okay. I just want to walk into my dads house hug him one more time laugh about anything. He always dropped whatever he was doing to help out family, no matter what. My mom and him were divorced for 20 years and when mental health kicked my moms butt and she couldn’t take care of my little brother and was about to go homeless my dad was there for her offering her his bed even after 20 years. I just keep rambling on because I really don’t even know how to end this I just don’t even know. I love you so much dad and I miss you. His favourite beer was Budweiser and I don’t drink beer so if anyone could pop a bud for my dad. Thank you. He also loved to fish. He was most happiest sitting on the lake with his boys fishing all day. I love my dad so much he was an asshole sometimes but that’s cuz he wanted what’s best for us and what dad isn’t an asshole sometimes. He never beat me or made me feel embarrassed he was always there. My youngest brother was even only my half brother but my dad called him his son, and my brother called him dad. I know my dad wasn’t a dumbass I fucking know that to the absolute top of anything. He just made a dumb idea. Must have been feeling 19 again. I love you so much dad. I’m gonna try everyday to be okay for you and to make sure mom will be okay. I’m gonna be the best dad just like you were to me. ❤️❤️❤️❤️",depression

He knocked on my door at around 6 in the morning to ask me to take him out. 6 in the morning. Im fucking half naked inching the door open while this man asks me at 6 in the morning if I can take him out to a couple places today.

I said no. I’m in the middle of finals. I know a couple places means “5 places that I’ll spend an hour each in”. 

I said no and he said alright. I thought that was the end of it. I get back in bed. An hour later he’s slamming shit in the kitchen, slamming doors closed downstairs, till finally, he comes up to me again, pounding on the door, asking me to take him somewhere. I said no and he started fucking screaming. 

Over the word no.

He eventually said nevermind and a second later he’s walking out the door slamming the door on his way out.

Over the word no.

I often think about this and I hate myself for the way I am because it limits me from being able to do so many things in life and live up to my fullest potential. It’s especially hard when you see your friends and peers excelling in life, getting good jobs and forming great relationships. 

I have rejected many good jobs because it gives me social anxiety. I am highly sensitive and many of my previous jobs gave me depression as I was often “too quiet” or just did not fit in with the rest.

"I have lost my empathy. Before my depression, there was warmth and curiosity in my personality. When people I cared about told me their stories I listened and felt happy for them. When I saw a family member struggling I would feel compassion for them and I would do what I could to help them. 


I seem to have lost this. When someone tells me about themselves or their experiences, I don't care unless it affects me. Their stories are boring to listen to, even the closest life events. Engagements, marriages, accidents, ilness, none of it interests me. I feel extremely guilty over this and it's a big part of my illness. When I speak to someone, I feel intense anxiety and a bit of fear. It feels like the person speaking to me will get upset because I'm not enthustiastic or engaged in the conversation - as if they'll think I don't enjoy spending time with them and thus stop spending time with me. I'm afraid of losing them and being alone.


It's true, though - I don't enjoy spending time with them, which is part of why I feel so horrible in the first place.

I didn’t even want them to read them even if I had killed myself. He freaked out and showed them to my sister, who showed my dad. They then decided to search my entire room they went though every box and they took all the cloths out of my closet. They took everything out of my desk. Read though all of my notebooks. This happen last Wednesday and they didn’t tell me until Sunday. I saw my parents 3 Times between the time they found the notebooks and SH stuff. They said the his hospital told them to go though all of my stuff and they also told them not to tell me. I am really devastated that they read something so personal that I never wanted them to read. Now I don’t know what to do. All I’ve done since I found out is cry. I feel worse now then when I went into the hospital. Thanks for reading. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I just really need a place to rant. ",depression

I spent the last 5 days browsing Youtube, alone in my flat with hardly any news from my surroundings. I should look for a job but procrastination has taken a toll on me. My near future is uncertain and I feel unable to take responsible decisions for myself. I have to leave my flat in the end of the month. I will probably end up living at my parents again for a few months until I find something to do with my life.

Night is the worst. It's dark, silent, empty and I normally cry to sleep. It's easy to get out of bed if one of the kids are crying but if not it's hard. 


None of them will ever know her. She had loads of issues but I thought we could work them out. I thought she was better.

I was staring at a glass of water mixed with a drug that in that dose has a near 100% chance of killing me. Stared at it for about an hour and even raised the glass up to my lips. But I never drank it. Something stopped me and I'm not sure what. 

But nothing's changed. I still want to die and everything is still shitty.

The only person I ever loved and cared about stopped being my friend when I opened up about my mental health. Just completely abandoned me. Everything else in my life has been shitty but that has really been a kick in the guts. I keep reaching out, hoping she'll reply to me and be friendly one day. But on the rare occasion she replies it's ""I don't want to deal with you"", ""find someone else"", etc. I fucking have nobody else. Everything I've tried has failed. Getting nowhere I'm therapy.

Just imagine yourself not fitting into those sets of species. We all supposedly ""have a purpose"" to fill, but what if you don't fit that category? Where do we go from there?

In my situation, I personally think I am not fit for this world. I suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health. Similarly, my emotional health is just as bad and it deteriorates my motivation to do anything. I have no one personal and close that can fully understand my situation. I lost the one person I loved deeply and now she is with someone else. There's nothing and no one left to live for.

"Slowly, I didn't realize I was already killing myself First I killed the athlete. There wasn't much of him to begin with so it was easy. At the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days. He even joined some after school group of friends to play with, that didn't really go anywhere.

Next I killed the gamer. He was easy to kill too because of the need, the corporate life taking much of my time didn't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight. His antics still surface every now and then, making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors. I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.

Next I killed the party boy. This one, took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two. I had to kill his connections with his friends. I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain.

Next I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab. It was easy enough from then on. 

I'm just afraid, that eventually, I might kill the writer too. And when I do, I don't really know what's left.

I'm actually surprised to realize that I've been hurting myself without physically doing so. I've lost more of myself in the past few months than I ever had in years. And I'm not making any more of me than what I already have.


PS. I wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago. And putting what I've been doing in words, has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain ""myself"" throughout the past year. I still get spans of time where I feel like nothing, where I feel afraid of being nothing that I'd rather just lose my life. But remember all you've been through, things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless, you matter, there's a value to everything you've done and accomplished.

Depression steals your youth away I remember when I was 15 and my depression started that was 1995 I hated school with a passion that was the first year I ever was on a antidepressant aka Prozac which didn't help at all. By the year 2000 I was finishing High School I was going on 6 years of depression at that point and I already had a overdose suicide attempt a year prior. Now I'm 40 years old and it has been 26 years of depression I never accomplished anything in my life never even had a gf a complete absolute loser and now on top of that I have permanent neurological health problems that makes my life even worst it's not from my suicide attempt but something not related. I guess my point is depression made me lazy and a miserable bastard that never connected with the outside world it stoled my youth away something I can never have back. Living with regrets is just as bad as depression don't be me there is no recovering from lost time and permanent health issues plus clinical depression it's a living hell. All I can say is if you're still young and at least have your physical health you need to go and try your hardest to at least try to find happiness while you can. It may seem impossible but don't be a loser like me and quit right away keep on pushing while you can before it's to late.,depression

"I’m so caught up in my web of depression that I sometimes forget that there are people out there who are content with their lives and want to keep living. It just seems so strange to me that most people don’t spend every waking moment hating themselves and thinking about death. 

Like while they’re waiting for the train what do they think about if not jumping on the tracks and ending it right there?
Or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them?
Do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think “what a nice tree that is” instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from?

How is it possible that some people just don’t want to die? Not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive. It makes me feel so guilty for all the times I’ve wished to get cancer so I can die without having to do anything.

"Turned my life around, depression didn't go away. What's the fucking point then? After 10 years of feeling miserable, and struggling to overcome and move on from all the failure in my life, I eventually got to the point where, objectively speaking, my life was in a good spot.

At 29 I finally graduated from the degree I'd started at 18, I somehow got lucky enough to land a really good job. I'd started exercising more and going to the gym. I'd always struggled with feelings of extreme loneliness, but now I was dating a girl who obviously loved me.

Throughout my 20s I thought if I pushed hard enough and persevered, I could eventually be happy.

But good old me, I'm still miserable. The success I've finally found doesn't make me feel anything. I still feel like an empty shell. My brain just doesn't register any positive emotions, only negative ones. I have zero motivation to live when there is no emotional reward for good experiences.

 I broke up with the girl I was dating, because even though I cared about her, and on some level I knew it was good to have someone in my life who cared about me, I seemed unable to experience feelings of being in love. It was eating me up inside knowing that I couldn't reciprocate the love she felt for me. 

I feel cheated for having spent so much time trying to turn my life around, only for it to have made no difference. I'm so tired. I'm tired of therapy and trying to get help. Tired of having to push myself to keep existing, when all I get in return is feeling sad and lonely. I'm tired of suddenly finding myself a few years older and realising I have no new happy memories.

"I'm almost 28 and i have wasted my life In a few months i will 28 and i have wasted my life. I have never had a job, a girlfriend, or a close friend. I graduated high school in 2012 and since then i have isolated myself rarely leaving my house. I'm posting this hoping someone will listen and maybe give advice.

I was raised by my grandparents and growing up they were controlling and overprotective. I did not get to do things most other kids were doing. I just stayed home all the time and played video games or watched tv. When i was in school i had no friends and rarely talked. I was not bullied but most of my classmates would not talk to me.  My teachers said i had a learning disability so thought out school i had extra help with my classes.. My grandfather died in 2007, After high school i isolated myself.  I have had opportunities to get jobs but i was scared to talk to strangers. The time has passed by so fast and i  cant believe i let this happened.

I Feel like there is no hope for things to change. Who would hire someone like me. I made bad grades in school and too poor to go to a community college.  I also would like a girlfriend but I'm short and too shy.  I'm very depressed and thinking about ending my life.

"Mom said I’m free to commit suic*de if I finished my study. I’ve been suffering from depression for more than 15 years and recently for many reasons it gets worse. In the year of 2017 my parents asked me to get a masters degree since my previous education was too bad, I successfully got enrolled but due to my mental health condition and my social phobia I feel it’s really hard for me to keep going, especially when I compare myself to other rich and happy schoolmates, I feel no motivation and no willing to focus on my study, I like it but it’s all because of my family wanted it, not me. I then realized that I haven’t done anything for my own good, I just fulfill other people’s wish all the time, this realization makes me frustrated and feeling hopeless and meaningless. So I’m being suicidal for some months. I talked to my mom last month, I said if I could quit, because I want to restart my own life and try to enjoy. I know I mess up my 31 year long life already since I don’t have a goal I am just being alive as my parents’ best obedient kid, I see no future, no meaning in my life so I want to give up, I feel so excited when thinking about death, a relief and a method to solve all the pains. 
I talked about these feelings with my mom and dad I hope they can be understanding and supportive but they said no, I can’t quit before I finish my school, also they said if I want to die, it’s better to finish my school first then I can die with a certificate, that at least makes them feel good that I did a thing.  

I really want to die as a revenge to them, they don’t care about me and my problem, they said if I die it’ll be a huge loss and shame for them, because their peers would really look down to them. But now they seem to know that my depression isn’t a made up excuse so they tried to negotiate with me, they literally said that I can kill myself if I could at least get the certificate, I really let them down all the time they said if I could try at least once?

I have no friends no relationship no one I could talk to with my problems but I don’t think anything will help me out. I’m just super suicidal I cry all day, I want to end everything but I hate my mom’s sad face and crying.",depression

"My brother plans to kill himself on 7/2 Hi everyone,

I'm 24 y/o female, my brother is a 19 y/o. Mid May, my brother was taken to the hospital for attempting suicide. His online friends called his college to request a wellness check and got the cops involved. They found him unconscious in his dorm room. 

We have a very toxic mom. To give you some context, my mom told him ""Do it right the next time so we don't have to drive 8 hours to pick you up."" She loves us but she's very immature, toxic, physically abusive, mentally abusive, etc. She's sort of a horrible human being but in her mind, she has done all she can for us. She had me when she was 19, single mom, we don't talk to our dad. 

He's set on doing it again because my brother and I have an extremely close relationship and he doesn't want to be a burden on me. He has been failing school, hates my mom, and feels like if he kills himself, my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem. But my mom will never know that. He thinks I'll be sad for a couple of years but I'll get through it because I'm a strong person. He has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt. 

My brother is the best. But my mom has fucked him up so much. He feels like he doesn't deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that I'll have to take care of him when I went through so much to get where I am. I just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast.

I also want to note there is a genetic component. On my mom's side, my grandpa, my uncle have killed themselves. My mom has attempted suicide when I was in high school by jumping off our apartment but survived. I have been depressed since age 7 but became healthy two years ago. My brother has felt this way since he was 10. I told him once I get a job I can take him away forever and help him get his life back on track but he doesn't want to burden me. 

What do I do? Has anyone been in a situation like this?",depression

I’m not depressed, I know a lot of people would miss me and I would destroy my parents if I actually tried to do anything. But none of this truly matters sometimes. I feel empty in a way I can’t put into words and I’m just looking for someone who can relate to this - lack of - feeling. I don’t want to actually pursue a career, I don’t feel motivated to do anything, I don’t see myself working as a teacher and actually being happy, but I also don’t see myself working with anything and being happy.
I just want it to stop. I don’t want to exist, to have to follow social rules, to be human. Sometimes I just feel like every action I make is forged and I’m just waking up everyday, putting on a mask or something and pretending I care about the world. I don’t. I think humans are as insignificant as ants, and that’s actually a beautiful thing. We’re bound to fulfill our duties, keep the engine working and then die.
I wish I could just unplug without hurting anyone, just vanish as if I’d never existed.
No one knows about how I feel, ‘cause I’m the only person who truly knows myself. I get everything done, but everything makes me exhausted. It’s like other people have it all figured out and I’m the only one who can’t bare having to do the simplest of tasks.

"I regret not committing suicide when I was younger As a teenager I thought about it a lot.
Came close once or twice.

Now I regret it so much. If I had done it then, only my family would have been affected. And it’s partially their fault so maybe it would have served as a teachable moment for them.

Now, I have friends and a partner that would be absolutely destroyed if I did it. They don’t deserve it.

I wish I had done it when I still had so few attachments, when there was so little harm to be done.

Now I am condemned to exist to avoid hurting those I love.

"my pain (25F) is overwhelming: i've been quarantining in an abusive household for the last year and am in need of some kind words i've been struggling a lot this week. my mental health has always been shit but lately, it's just gotten worse. i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she wasn't accepting the new provider (she wasn't a good fit for me either, but something is better than nothing). so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends, i don't have anyone i can rely on. i feel bad venting to the people around me because they're all going through tough times too and it just doesn't feel fair for me to unload on them. so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea, even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain.

the heart of it all is that i have C-PTSD (along with other psych disorders) and these past few weeks I've been drifting in and out of disassociation, flashbacks, and episodes of crying fits. i can't stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive self-talk. right now i'd say my self-worth and self-esteem are at a 0. it doesn't help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i don't have anywhere else to go, and this is something I've dealt with my whole life. my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive. he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge. so between the flashbacks, disassociation, and deeply painful depression, i just feel so unsafe in my house. if my parents see me crying, they'll either gaslight or bully me. i just wish things were different. i don't really know where i'm going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty. that i am a good person and i deserve a good life. i just want to stop crying.

At the end of the session he asked for my ID for administrative purposes. When he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday, he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded, ""who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday?!"" Of course, I couldn't care less if it was my birthday - I tend to forget my own age. However, his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart, that *at last*, I recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter.

"I need at least one person to see this. I have 0 reason to live, because I can't care about my obligations to others. If you google ""reasons to live"" they pretty much all say that they carry on living because they dont want to cause pain to their loved ones. I have very little loved ones, and I cant express enough how little I give a shit about how sad they're gonna be when I kill myself. There is no way they will feel as terrible as I do everyday, at least have the ability to get over it whereas I am condemned to this suffering until I die some other way. I think about how my girlfriend will feel if she finds out I've killed myself and I just do not care, I love more than anything, even more than myself, but I want death so badly that there is nothing that convince not to do it now. My mum, dad, brother, grandad, grandma and literally everybody in my family will be devastated beyond words, and I am fine with that. Because I will have victory for once, I will fixed it at the greatest possible cost and I'm glad. Their sadness is of no concern of mine when im fucking dead. 

I do not enjoy living, as I have stated in other posts. I dont care about the little things in life. The smell of freshly cut grass isnt a valid reason to fucking live, you jackass. I may laugh at things that are funny, and may enjoy making others laugh, and enjoy the company and love of my girlfriend, but it just isnt enough. I need some other way of relief of my problems if not suicide, I am not fucking willing to put in any hard work, because I could just kill myself lol. I need a giant stroke of luck, or a huge incredibly forgiving second chance that will just make everything go away. I wish all my problems could just be fixed by some miracle solution, and they all say it's just hard work that will fix it. 

But no pal, it's suicide and it's a legitimate solution. It ends my problems and that's all I want. I'm quite frankly sur people arent just okay with people suicide, and that it doesnt happen even more than it does. It's just such an absolute and perfect solution for everything, the only reason people stop is because they feel obligated to others, but I just dont have that filter.

"How do people just accept working 40+ hours a week for the rest of their lives? I know this is just how society works--we have to work in order to benefit from the work of others...the exchange of labor. It seems like most people have just accepted this as reality. They get their work done and then enjoy the rest of their time and the things they get to do with the money they've earned working. But I can't seem to do that.

The idea of spending more than half my waking hours 5 days a week doing something I don't want to do and find stressful for someone else makes me feel so incredibly hopeless. It's only Saturday, and I'm already dreading entering a whole new workweek. This feeling gets much worse on Sundays. And then during the week, I come home from work and know I have to go back in a matter of hours, and the thought makes me miserable and basically ruins the time I don't have to be working.

"How the fuck do people find things they actually like and stick with it?? One of the big pieces of advice I see for depressed people online is to ""find a hobby"" or find something fulfilling. I can see how this would be a great piece of advice, if it actually worked for me. 

Any time I pick something new up, I kind of enjoy it, keep doing it for a few weeks (maybe even a month if I'm lucky), get bored and then stop. Rinse and repeat, every goddamn time. I've tried the gym, running, tennis, football, photography, hell even playing video games I get bored of eventually. 

Maybe it's because of my depression, but I really struggle to find something I actually enjoy to the point of wanting to do it as much as possible over a long period of time. Most things that I find which I genuinely enjoy, my enjoyment/determination fizzles out after a few weeks to the point where my effort put in outweighs my enjoyment so I just stop. How do people find things they enjoy and actually want to stick with it for a long period of time??

"I don't want to end up in psychiatric hospital I told my mom about my suicidal thoughts. She quickly proposed to put me in an hospital.

Fuck. You. I'm not crazy, I don't need to be restrained, if I kill myself, I assure you, you will not be able to stop me.

I need meds, I need attention, I need you to listen.

Edit: thank you for your replies. I can't reply to everybody, so I'm just going say important things here.

"jUsT gO tO tHe GyM I do go to the gym, plenty of people on this subreddit go to the gym.

It’s not fucking good enough and committing to exercise is hard even for a mentally healthy person. 

People on this subreddit really need to stop suggesting this so fucking loosely.

I’m struggling to get out of bed just to go.

But in my heart all I can do is just be a worthless piece of shit that can’t do anything right.

And the thought of not going plays into my anxiety that I’m ruining all my progress.

"Life is too much of doing what I don't want to do in order to survive What do I want to do? I want to sit around, jerk off, and play video games. Every second of my life is devoted to just keeping a roof over my head, a car on the road, a cell phone on, and having enough food to eat. I get zero pleasure from other people, none. This life is a long, hellish, humiliating road that only leads to absolute nothingness. There can be no peace. There can be no love. None of it is worth it at all. Life inherently sucks and requires too much time and energy. The worst thing I hate about life is that I used to go to bed more or less due to whatever responsibilities I had at the time. Now I sleep because all of the work required of me throughout the day has made me tired. 

I just want to be asleep forever. Nothing makes me smile anymore. I am tired of people, but I have to keep dealing with them every minute of every day. Nothing in this world can make up for that hell. I want to sleep forever.",depression

"Went for 2 AM walk in the rain, finally felt alive and free. After 3/4 of a bottle of pinot grigio I decided to take my one woman pity party outside. I let the rain fall on my face. I let it soak my sweater. I walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me. I stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face. I held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body. I waked through the park. I got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as I could, like when I was a kid. I spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks. I fucking skipped down the middle of the street, in the rain, without a soul around.

And I know I will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day. But I really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys. 

Sorry for the theatrics, the pinot is still working its magic. Happy Tuesday.

Edit: Just wanted to say how moved I am by other people sharing their similar experience or saying that this post made them feel happy or comforted.

"43 and completely lost I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct.  I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression.  I'm so disappointed in the person I've become.  No matter how much I read or do, it's like I have not gained any wisdom on managing life's challenges.  I grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations.  I was an A student through college but my social skills have always been lacking.  I managed to work for the past 20 years, but I couldn't keep up in my current job, hence the medical leave.   

I've been in therapy for much of the past 10 years.  My psychologist believes I have traits of avoidant personality disorder.  I take several antidepressants and I'm currently two weeks into TMS therapy.  Nothing seems to help.  I'm unbelievably critical of myself.  Even now, as I write this message, I am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on Reddit.   I've been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written.  I'm even more amazed by the responses.  How are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice?  I read everything I can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained.  I can't imagine giving advice to someone.  There is so little I can think of to say to people in distress.  

I'm a mess right now.  I have lost hope of getting better.  I don't exercise, I sleep 14 hours a day.  I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents.  Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me.  The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since.  I have some solid friends that I've known since high school.  They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. 
I can't seem to learn anything these days.  I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things.   I can't imagine surviving another 40 years.  I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer.  I've no real skills to rely on.  I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day.  I no longer think I'm capable of having a family.  Too overwhelming.  I would be an awful spouse and father.
I don't plan to go back to work.  I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life.  By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them.  My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run.  

I've read so much on coping with this disease.  But so little spurs me to action.  Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions.  The weed stopped working for me though.  Now if I smoke, it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse.  

Thanks for reading all this.  I love you.",depression

"I’m kinda disgusted with myself I have a depression nest. My bedroom is disgusting. I have a path from my door to my bed and that’s just about it. Everywhere else I have piles of clothes and old food containers and boxes and crap I don’t need. I have a hoarding problem on top of being too depressed to clean; my dad is a pack rat too so I’ve always spent my life in clutter. I don’t think it’s at TV show level but it’s still bad. Does anyone have tips/advice for finally cleaning up? I’ve been trying but honestly some days I pick up like 2 pieces of trash and toss a couple things in a laundry basket and I automatically feel drained.


I remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking “I’m coming!” For “come in” I was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room, always locking the door, because I was never more embarrassed. I saw the shock on her face as I rambled off reasons for the mess “I just dumped everything in here when I moved in, I’ve just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted” I know she didn’t buy it she must have thought I was the nastiest person alive, she asked if I wanted help but I declined and said I’d handle it. I never really did.


I can handle living in clutter. It’s all I’ve ever really known. I do wish I had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion I do try to organize everything it never lasts. But I feel so guilty. Guilty because I have a dog. He’s been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he doesn’t deserve this life. Like I said we’ve always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse. He gets fresh food and water and I try to take him outside often so there’s no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this. I know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when I walk through the door, his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles. I know he loves me and I love him with my entire heart. He’s one of the only things that keep me going because I’m afraid of what would happen to him if I were gone. I don’t think my family would be the best caretakers and I saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died. I saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time. When we’d pull up in the car he’d race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out. My family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when I first left for college. I wouldn’t want to leave him hurt and confused like that so I keep pushing on. But I can’t let him keep living like this. 


I’m disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but I’ll do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away. It definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but I still want to try.

Also a big thanks for the awards.

"The cancer has spread to my liver Well it's most likely the cancer, anyways. The doctors like to make me feel better by saying there's a chance it'll be benign, but so far it never has been. Every test has come back as bad news, which just leads to more tests and more uncertainty. The pain in my hips has come back, and knowing I have a fresh mass in my liver that's already 5cm across....it freaks me out. It wasn't there when I had surgery in the beginning of may, which means it's spreading, and fast. I was feeling ok for a couple weeks, but the pain is coming back and I'm scared for the abdominal pain to come back...that was the worst. The hurt in my hip is like a constant dull ache that's always bothering me, but the pain in my abdomen was like always feeling like puking but never actually puking, along with stabbing pain if I moved wrong. I don't want that again. I even talked to my doctor about going back to work and she said go for it if I feel okay, but what if I don't actually feel okay? What if it just keeps getting worse? Will I ever be back to normal? Will I be able to go back to school in the fall? Will I be able to finish my degree or will the cancer completely derail the one goal I had finally started to crawl towards? I have a biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks and I'm scared for that; my first biopsy didn't give conclusive results that lead to 4 months of waiting for surgery bc no one thought it was serious. Im terrified of that happening again.

Im just so full of uncertainty and I'm scared and I feel like im not valid for feeling any of it. People have it worse than I do, so my brain tells me I don't get to be upset. But I am. But I don't want to be. I'm conflicted. I'm upset. I want to sleep so I don't have to feel.

Forgive the rant, but thank you if you read through my woes anyways.

Edit: I posted this without much thought last night in the middle of a break down and went right to sleep afterwards. I can't believe the amount of support people have shown me...im in shock. You all are so nice and lovely...it definitely helps the ol psyche when so many people affirm that I'm allowed to be upset.

"Aging is fucked I genuinely don’t want to be an older age. The idea of saying 26 or 27 when someone asks how old I am sounds fucking horrible to me. I’m just about coping with the fact that I’m 25 now.

Not because going into your late 20s is an objectively bad experience. Its more so because of  how society (especially the college age and below) vilify and basically makes fun of being around those ages.

It’s the “your pushing 30 and you’re still doing this or that” that I constantly see. It’s the whole age gap conversation that I feel like I see every other day on social media. The idea that I’ll soon be seen as a “creep” for being attracted to a 20 y/o is so deeply depressing to me. Especially cause I feel like I was just 19/20/21 myself and I blew that whole period of my life living like a hermit, just letting the weeks, months and birthdays just come and go. I feel like my youth is gone, and more than anything I want a second chance at it.

I just feel like people my age are already parents, in serious/long term relationships and a few are even engaged/married. Life truly is moving too fast and a large part of me wants out.",depression
"Started planning a road trip as an alternative to killing myself I've always wanted to travel by myself but always been too scared (I'm 22F). Now that I'm on the verge of killing myself it's like why not. I don't care anymore. I'm not doing anything with my time (summer break) and I have money to burn (probably shouldn't burn through it but whatever, it wouldn't be used if I was dead). At least I will get to be away from this town and state with all these horrible memories. 

Edit: I'm traveling from Baton Rouge. I'll probably just go through Texas (namely Houston and San Antonio) for a week or 2. It's not the craziest trip but I think big enough for someone who's never traveled alone. Hopefully if it goes well I can maybe plan another trip somewhere else before school starts

"I just went from not leaving my room for 3 years with the biggest fear of going outside, to wanting to solo travel again! In 3 days. Hi I’m 21M and before this Friday morning, I had never traveled before in my entire life without my parents. No friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how I’m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but I’ve improved myself so much in these 3 days.

I’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn’t thought I could find, I’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think I could do that. I’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I’ve done it every time anyway!

I’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven’t found anyone, and I’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and I just feel so free!

I lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it’s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. Wow!!!” And freaked out cause I can’t believe I’m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?!

I ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?)

Now I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!)

The clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself)

This is more progress I’ve done in a friday-Sunday trip then I’ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city.

I’m so proud of myself!

Feels lonely tho so I kinda wanna cry, I’m imaging how awesome this trip would’ve been (even more awesome) if I had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me! (I’m gay)

I’m so proud of myself. I wanna cry right now cause I’m going home tomorrow,I thought I would never say this, but I can’t wait to travel again! Preferably with someone this time!

I know this sounds cringe and I can’t believe Ive done this. I’m so confused why I don’t have panic attacks and stuff! But if I can do it, you can do it too. It really isn’t that scary, when u have small “missions” all the time to think about. I gotta go to x to eat and I gotta go see y and I gotta go check what train I’m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me  busy.

I know that when I get home tomorrow, it’s back to normal and misery waiting for me. But this was, I gonna say it SUPER FUN! I haven’t had this much fun in sooo many years!

I feel alive.

"So I bought myself flowers today. No special occasion. I just had a tough day at work so I picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home. Not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. ""What's the big deal?"" you're probably thinking. The big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of ""treating myself"" to anything ""just because"" filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. You don't deserve it. It's too good for you. You're not worth the time/effort/money. You are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. 


So now I really appreciate any small act of kindness I afford myself. Yes, there are still days that I force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because I hate it. I love cooking delicious food for other people, but I still sometimes eat instant noodles when I'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. But today I showed myself a little kindness. I acknowledged the fact that I work damn hard and I am great at my job. I have value and I am valued. Tulips are beautiful and so am I. I deserve to have beautiful things in my life because I am a badass bitch.


EDIT: Wow :) Thank you everybody. Honestly I didn't expect much of a response to this, I was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol. I'm so happy it put a little smile on a few faces and even happier if it reminded even one of you wonderful people to be a little kinder to yourself. You're all awesome!!!

"Many pandemic-depressives didn't have empathy for mental health sufferers until it affected them. Once the pandemic is over, they'll recover and resume their lives forgetting their empathy for others. 

I've been depressed from childhood  and no one cared. Imagine going through racism, bullying, social exclusion and loneliness from 5 years old to adulthood.

I've put in tremendous efforts in improving myself and meeting people through various ways, yet, I get turned down because of my appearance (race and being not conventionally attractive etc.) or my quiet/ introverted personality and therefore, written off as ""weird"". How wonderful it would be to have friends that genuinely care.

Some of these people posting on social media about caring for others and reaching out are doing it just for the likes and popularity. So many of these phonies are the same assholes that would not give me/ people like me the time of day despite  ""reaching out"" to them. 

They're nothing but insincere and hypocrites that have in the past, contributed to the loneliness and mental health issues of others.

"i honestly can't tell if i'm depressed or lazy as shit hi everyone, using a throwaway to avoid identification.

as i (19F) write this, i'm on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason. before this, i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv, save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles. at dinner, i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food (this is kinda embarrassing). my mum keeps asking me why i'm always lying down (not in a malicious way or anything) and i can't really pinpoint the reason but i'm always unexplainably exhausted. the good days are fine and sometimes really good, but the bad days (like today) just really suck. i feel like i am suspended in time and everything is in slow motion. i have wasted yet another day.

for some context, i'm in a transitional period in my life (graduated from high school, waiting to start college in october). i've had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world (got accepted to some really good schools etc.). however, for the most part, nothing really excites me. this is a real low compared to my last 2 years of high school (consistent high achiever, top student for a bunch of subjects, you get the gist) during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things. i notice that, when i'm not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school, i always get like this more intensely than otherwise (like during summer vacations).

another thing- every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them. i've barely done anything. the only 2 things i managed to bring myself to do in the last 3 months were the result of me being talked into them by various people. i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them. i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go ""i am tired and i'll do it another day"". i feel like shit because i don't know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that i'm lazy.

my head is really heavy as i write this, so i apologize for my stream-of-consciousness writing style. the reason why i'm so confused is that, when i am in social settings, i'm really lively and fun. i'm also a very typical ""gifted"" kid / overachiever  with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit. i have a loving family and supportive friends. i am grateful for everything i have, but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes. i don't dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me. 

i don't know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays. basically, if people arent giving me responsibilities, i can't bring myself to do anything.

i'm so sorry i don't have the ability to organise this coherently right now, but could anyone share what depression can feel like? or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic? some clarity would be amazing. please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem, at least i can stop being self-pitying and start doing something about it. 

just a disclaimer: i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear. don't worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it.

that was a really long post. if you read to the end, thank you :)

When I struggled with an eating disorder, they didn't want to take me to counseling because ""you know they just put the parents under a microscope"".

I'm officially done. I don't care about these people any more. I told them the most vulnerable, deepest secret of mine and I so badly just wanted a hug and genuine help and all I got was a ""tough love talk"" about ""how I don't deserve to be depressed"".

"Annus Horribilus Today is the anniversary of my daughter's death. She died in my arms, and I am grateful I could be with her. She was 25, and we were very close; cut from the same cloth.
She had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism, creating 'the perfect storm' that resulted in her death. She made no secret of her desire to die, but her death wasn't suicide, per se.
In the year prior to her passing I was diagnosed with esophegal cancer, and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment. Nobody expected me to live, and I think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me.
During my time in hospital my ex wife, my daughter's mother, came to stay with my daughter to care for her. I've since discovered, from reading my daughter's reddit, emails and texts, that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time.
I demanded to be released from hospital early, as my daughter's health had deteriorated, and they made arrangements to get me home. I was unable to speak in more than a whisper, had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but I was happy to be home with my daughter. We spent quality time together.
When she died a few weeks later I arranged the funeral and the wake. I couldn't deliver a eulogy, or even toast her life.
My daughter had very few friends, partly because of her treatment resistant depression, and partly because she just didn't suffer fools lightly. But the friends she did have she treated like gold. One was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt, and my daughter drove 400 kms to visit him, and she went back every day for days on end, just as example. None of them could manage to get to her funeral.
I have recovered, mostly, now. But I don't know why. I don't want to live. Especially after this past year.
I am posting this not out of self pity but as a belated eulogy to my very, very special daughter. Without her the world is black and white and devoid of happiness.",depression

Saying you'll quit smoking as you buy another pack.

Wondering why you still have these problems at 30.

Crushing loneliness despite not actively seeking a relationship.

"my genitalia are destroyed after being raped and being prescribed lexapro. i don’t want to live anymore being raped and being on lexapro ruined my genitalia, and it’s ruining my state of mind. please help

hey yall. not sure how to start this so i think i’ll just get into it. at 12/13 years old, i (f19) started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school. i started therapy, and then lexapro at 17. my anxiety decreased, but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness. i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression, so i took the pill regularly and properly. 

when i was 18, i was unfortunately raped several times by my long-term boyfriend, who i considered to be the love of my life. what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed, now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly, incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life. 

not long after that, i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls, or an extreme form of vaginismus. ive always been incredibly ‘tight’ for a lack of better words, not able to fit a tampon, usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried. i’m not able to have proper sex because of it. the only time i’ve been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me, and that was the worst pain of my life, physically and emotionally. 


i’m now 19, and i’m in a happy committed relationship. i love him deeply, and he’s a great partner. however, i find myself so depressed that i can’t provide for him sexually. not only for his sake, but for mine. my entire genital region is broken, and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it. i understand that a working vagina (or any vagina for that matter) is not what makes a woman, but it’s the only way i can describe it since there’s no proper term for female emasculation. 


ive started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago, and im very anxious to not see any improvement. i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms. 


i understand that it can take up to three months, but im looking for reassurance from others in the same boat.


i can’t keep doing this anymore. i hate myself and body, and suicide is constantly on my mind. if anyone has dealt with this or something similar, i’d love to hear your advice. thank you :)

(please do not tell me that sex isn’t that important. ive had several people tell me it’s okay to not have it in our lives, but this is way deeper than that. this is now a physical issue.)",depression

"Therapy just made me more aware of how isolated I feel because most people suck at empathy I’ve been in therapy for years. In that I’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and I try to deal with it. I spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. For a depressed person I manage to excel in life.

Currently dealing with the sting of a breakup. Went on vacation to Asia and Ex broke NC before my trip to wish me well after what I gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener.

I’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.

My sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.

I was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.”

Creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me.

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

Edit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me

"Being passively s**cidal is exhausting. I have gone through the same stages so many times I am beyond exhausted. I feel passively suicidal and wish that someone would shoot me or I'd die in an accident or something. Being beset by these thoughts exhausts me to the point I feel numb and I dissociate from myself and whatever is happening around me. I fall into a state of being unproductive and become listless. At this point everything is a chore including basic things like brushing my teeth, doing my laundry, or going to the grocery. I have to then put all of these tasks on my habit tracker to create an incentive to do all of these things, and manufacture motivation by seeing the ""streak"" that I have maintained. I somehow then muster the energy over the span of weeks to reach a functional state where I am fairly productive. Then automatically, or by virtue of some trigger, my passively suicidal thought become intense, I become exhausted and the cycle repeats.

While reading the Posts I am always looking for those in my age bracket. Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to......
Lost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er.
The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. 
So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through.
BUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition.

So anyway I recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing I've been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone.  I can't drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like I can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit I need.  I have to get completely whacked on medication (which can be fun if you like it - but I don't like it when it is involuntary) to try to do anything physical around the house (like I HAD TO do this one thing or I'd get a fine) and even then it is just so painful and hard to move.  It will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe I can heal faster, I don't know.  It seems like doctors where I am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it - so now I can't get some pain meds when I legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing.

I really don't see much point in my living at all when I am just going through the motions of life but I'm miserable.  I can get by financially (so far) but I don't want to just get by while I feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself.  I hate it and there is no point to living this way - and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now.  I don't know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives - I guess they are happy enough with that?  I am not ok with it at all.  Hurting my family is the only reason I am waiting or haven't already gone through with it.  We don't get along so great right now but I would still never want to hurt them in that way.

I gotta add, just to be honest and inclusive, that I have anxiety as bad as I have depression.  It's almost agoraphobic - like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong.  Being stuck here I am not happy but I guess I am safe.  I shouldn't have to live like this, no one should.

Nobody knows how to talk to a friend who is deeply depressed. It must be difficult.

A few weeks ago, some of my coworker friends planned a night out for this weekend and invited me. I accepted and was looking forward to it, but a few days ago my one friend told me it had been moved to a later date due to scheduling conflicts.

I'm always wondering, 'How long can I keep it up this time?'

When the time comes that I finally admit it's all pointless, that my life will be terrible no matter what I try to do, it always feels more like accepting reality than depression. 

This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. Like Cypher knowingly going back into the Matrix to be able to eat ""steak.""

"I feel too sensitive to exist Being insecure sucks. Not only does it wreck my feelings toward myself, I’ve become fragile to everything around me. To the people around me. I can’t take insults or arguing. I think everyone is mean or doesn’t like me. It feels so silly, but I can’t shake off the sadness.
My first thought when things make me upset is I don’t want to live. I don’t like being this way anymore. I just want to be perfect or at least less insecure. I don’t like sharing these feelings to people, but I want someone to understand.
How do I stop being fragile. I feel like I’m too broken to be around people and I’m happier alone.

"I can't kill myself until my cat dies For as long as I can remember, I've dealt with constant suicidal ideation and intrusive thoughts of self-harm. It's gotten to the point where I feel like suicide is my destiny, because it's the only future outcome for myself I've ever envisioned.

I feel like the only thing that has prolonged my life is my cat. We are very close, especially since I've been housebound with the pandemic. She's always following me around. When I'm upset or crying, she gets in my lap to comfort me for hours. She sleeps on my chest every. night.

Every time I think about committing the act, I start to imagine what her life would be like after my passing. There's no way anyone in my family would keep or take care of her, so she'd probably end up in a shelter, where she'd be confused and depressed and constantly waiting for me to show up. Taking care of her is the only purpose I have in life, and I'm so grateful to her for giving me a reason to stick around year after year.  


EDIT: Thank you for the overwhelming response of kindness and support from this community. I wasn't expecting it, and it made my day. It seems like the general consensus is that I should get another cat, and I agree. It's something I'm looking into, and I'll be sure to update when I get a second furry friend. ",depression

"suicide isnt the answer, but people shouldn't call it the coward's way out I mean someone faced such an awful life filled with hardship, and people are going to call them cowardly? In my opinion, that's seriously low. They don't know what they've been through. How are you going to call someone cowardly if you don't know their story, or have never felt the exact feelings they felt? Everyone processes pain differently. Even though it could be ""no big deal"" for you, it could be pain and anguish for someone else. There is no such thing as a coward, everyone is brave in one way or another.

Sorry for the vent/rant but I seriously hate life... but I'm too stubborn to give up. And I don't want to be called a coward because of the few times I've thought about ending things because they got too hard or stressful. I don't necessarily mean killing myself, but I've thought about giving up getting life together, getting in shape. Because depression is so hard to break out of.

"No one showed. I should have expected that. I've only ever had one friend in my life. I've tried to make more, but people hate me. I've gone to community events, parties, hobby shops...etc to meet people. People just don't seem to click with me. I'm seen as odd, annoying, weird to name a few things I've been called. The only person I can call a friend is my wife. And I still do not understand how that came along. She just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different.

Earlier this year, my wife discovered I have never had a birthday party. I never really had any friends to have a party, so I just never tried to have one. She said that was an injustice and I should have a party and invite friends from facebook.

She decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. We planned it out for a month. Made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. 

Then the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. 

We got various excuses throughout the night. ""I got sick"", ""Stuff has come up"", ""car isn't starting"", ""No babysitters"", ""My boss just called me in"". 

My wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). 

I don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, ""Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative."" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. 

If I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.

Edit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.

Edit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. Example: She hates the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. She hates it to a point that if I watch it, it should be on my PC with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. I do it because I can understand it frustrates her. But I love the jokes so much and I see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of IASIP, but I have no one to share it with except the subreddit.",depression

"I sold my guns. They originally belonged to my grandpa; I'm not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and I was a pretty good marksman. When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.

My depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts. Impulses to do things I don't even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and I would fixate on the details of the aftermath until I would bring myself either to tears or to panic.

""What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?""

This is shit I do not need running through my mind.

Two years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.

So, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.

I got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000.

Later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner...

""What if I just went up there and--""

Then it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?

I did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.

I've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.

It's always going to be a struggle for me and I know that, but I feel free in a way that I never really expected.

"I disappointed everyone that expected great things from me When I was attending high school, i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university, particularly MIT. All my teachers were extremely proud of me. My parents were excited for my future in education. My peers thought highly of me. However, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression.

I would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. I eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing.

at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. 

my teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a ""disappointment"" according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. 

i would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to ""punish"" myself. 

to make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away.

I can’t make myself shower daily. The only time I fully wake myself up out of sleep is to go to work where I drag my feet for eight hours until I can clock out and sleep some more. I can’t take care of my child, when I’m off work I either put on kids shows on tv for him or leave him with the babysitter because she can take better care of him than I. I can’t take care of my husband, he’s tired of me being barely a person. Please just wish me luck and cross your fingers that this helps me. Love you all.",depression

"My fucking depression makes me horny all the time 24F here. My life’s a depressing toxic dump and I’m lonely as hell. Sex is my only escape from this dumpster fire. Angry? Horny.numb? Horny. Sad? Horny. Busy? Horny , tired ? Horny. or just plain fed up? My room is my happy place because nothing else gives me that feels. 
Deleted social media to ‘focus on myself lol’ but now all I do is think about sex  Feels good for a sec, then I’m just hollow. Am I broken or just craving love? This messed-up coping thing is starting to seem like my only option. 
And honestly im so over it lifes a mess . Lost my passion for gaming and all the fun stuff i used to do - so depressed bored and horny . Nothing really matters anymore ",depression
"Found my mother dead in her bed today. I don't know how to take care of myself. I went to check on my mother today when I thought she was taking a nap, to shockingly find she had passed away in her sleep. I completely relied on her to live. She was my everything. I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for her. I have no way of supporting or taking care of myself. I am riddled with suicidal thoughts and depression and she worked hard my entire life to support and take care of me. I have no job, I'll lose the house we rent, I can't afford anything myself. She did everything for me. I dont even know how to make a doctors appointment myself. I don't know what to do. I've always told myself that when she dies I'll just kill myself and thats all I can think of right now. My entire family was here all day and I had to pretend that I'll be okay, but I know I wont. Once everyone left I completely broke. I don't know what to do.",depression
"I don't get how other people aren't suicidal I'm in therapy, I'm taking medications and I still think almost daily about suicide. Nothing makes me feel happy and my life feels meaningless.I made friends because I thought beign lonely made me suicidal, I made plans for the future so I can have something to look forward to, I clean my room and go outside because it's good for me but nothing is ever enough. I asked my therapist why he wants to be alive, but nothing he told me seemed so fulfilling that it makes sense to keep going. I don't understand why most people don't want to die when life objectively sucks so much",depression
"Sudden sadness after socializing I visited with a friend for a few hours, it was fine, nothing bad happened, we chatted and ate lunch at a restaurant. When I got home I was met with this horrible wave of sadness and hopelessness, I just want to curl into a ball and disappear.

"I haven’t gotten out of bed in a month I (34f) literally have not left my bed in a month other than to go to the bathroom or get food from the kitchen. I order groceries from Instacart and shop on amazon if I need something. I haven’t showered (I hate the idea of water touching my body) but I have done basic hygiene daily.
I don’t sleep all day, in fact I’m usually up by 8, but I’ll spend my days reading(multiple books a day) , or watching tv on my iPad. 
I avoid calls and texts as much as I can, I just have no desire to interact, but I do respond occasionally.
I’m unemployed and live alone so I have no need to go anywhere or talk to someone during the day.
I have ADHD, depression, anxiety, OCD, excoriation (skin picking) and I take meds daily.

I’m not sure if I’m looking for help and advice or if I just needed to share with someone what I’m going through. But if anyone has advice, tips to help motivate me or even gone through something similar themselves, I would love to know. (Please be kind)",depression
"There's no getting better. You just become numb to it. Nobody admits it but it's true. ""*Time heals all wounds*"". Year after year you just get numb, it gets easier to muster but its different. I have improved, become more numb to all of it. There's no hope with this sickness.",depression

"I just can't fucking cope with life How the fuck do people keep going to work every day? How am I supposed to keep doing this? I'm literally just working part time at a coffee shop but I feel as though I am in agony every day. It's all meaningless and worthless, we literally work a job so we can afford to live another day to work our job. I can't even begin to comprehend how anyone is happy. My family work so much more than I do, and I can tell they're stressed out, but they push through. I just can't wrap my mind around it. Fuck. Just fuck it all.

I appreciate all the replies, I don't really have it in me to respond individually, so I'll just say here, thanks for the good wishes and for sharing your own struggles.

"I opened up to a friend and she called me a loser She was a close friend of mine. She has recently texted me asking how I'm doing and if everything's going fine. 

I finally couldn't keep it in me and I snapped. I told her how sad I am, how much I wanna end it all and how I'm in depression and how I won't find the love of my life In a more detailed way. 

She responded a couple of hours later saying 

""over a fucking girl? that's pretty low"" 

i asked her what do you mean? 

She says ""that's some down bad loser shit ngl"" 

I ask her again ""why would you say that?"" 

She doesn't respond and hasn't ever since yesterday. today i decided to remove her from my friend list. I think that was a good decision.",depression
"I'll be 26 in 3 days and all I can think about is that I've comepletly wasted my life And I know that sounds ridiculous but I’m honestly devastated. I'm not anything that a 25 year old is supposed to be. I'm not pretty or thin or fun. I'm not spontaneous, or sexy or uninhibited. I don't have any friends. I don't have a partner. I don't have anything except regrets. And I know I'm still young but it feels like it's too late for me to clean up the mess I've made of my life. I just...I don't know what to do. All I know is that these are supposed to be some of the best years of my life and I've spent every one of them hating myself and wishing I were different. And when I think about having to live another 25 years feeling the same way, I want to give up. ",depression
"24 F I’m killing myself tonight and no one knows I can’t even believe that this is it. My heart is pumping through my ears, it’s almost like I’m nervous but I’m ready. Me and my long term relationship broke up because I’m a toxic piece of shit and he would genuinely rather be dead than listen to what I have to say anymore. All my hobbies are dead, I have no friends, I hate school, and I don’t think I was supposed to be alive this long anyway.

I almost feel guilty, like I’m doing this for attention or something. Nobody is going to know, at least not for a couple days. I’m home alone, so it’s the perfect opportunity to do so without thinking about the consequences. My plan is to lay on the couch and hopefully OD while I’m sleeping so that whoever walks in (probably my older sister) doesn’t have to deal with the trauma of gore. I’m pretty sure I have a brain bleed or something going on in my skull from a nasty fall I took, so if that OD doesn’t work hopefully I just succumb to my injuries. I stole my mom’s opioids from her back injury a while ago and have been hiding them in the back of my closet.

I’m leaving my dog a lot of food and water just incase and a note saying that my mom can have him. He’d be happier with her anyway.

I just can’t believe this is my last day. I wish I would have done things differently. I wish I would have went to the mall one last time, or maybe the movies or something. I wish I would have gone to see my sister, and my mom, and tell my highschool bestfriend how much I miss her. I want my second oldest sister to know how much she ruined me as a person, and that this is 100000% her fault. I wish I got to eat my favorite food and watch my favorite TV show one last time. God, I wish I could convey to my dog how much I love him. I wish he could know that if I wanted my last breaths on earth to be with anyone, I would want it to be with him by my side. That I’m sorry I’m so selfish that I won’t be there by his side when it’s time to experience his.

No more fuck ups, no more being miserable and pathetic and a joke. No more never shutting up and making people hate the sound of my voice. No more not being pretty enough, or skinny enough, or sexy enough, or smart enough. Just eternal peace. I’m nervous but it’s time and it’s been time for a while.

Good luck to you, Reddit.",depression
Finally let my wife know I was suicidal and she told me to essentially man up and figure it out myself… Yeah I’m done. She told me to go get help and figure it out myself. No real compassion at all from her at all. I really hate being a man. I know what I must do now. ,depression
"""Just go to the gym"" I don't typically get triggered about people giving their two cents, but this shit just aggravates me.

"One of the saddest feelings is really trying to heal and realizing your depression became a part of you. I used to self sabotage and act rather callously. I still do somewhat, although I’ve become more mindful. When I used to feel depressed I felt like I had a reason. Like my anxiety. Or the fact that I drank too much last night. Or that I was self deprecating all day. Or because I spoke/acted on impulse and suffered the consequences. While I still have very bad anxiety, my medication has started effectively dampening it. I’ve also started having fewer ideations in general, and I’ve been trying my hardest for the first time in my life to help myself get better. I stopped drinking almost completely (I sometimes have one/month), when my friends do illicit activities I opt out, I’ve taken away specific triggers, I’ve found a way to hold myself to a flexible eating schedule. But I’m noticing that by doing all of these “good” things I am starting to feel worse, because despite everything I am still depressed. I cannot stand in a single place doing nothing without feeling it. I can’t go to work without feeling it. I can’t have a day off without feeling it. And it’s causing some of the worst thoughts to start coming back, except this time I don’t have a crutch, and I still don’t have any motivation or hope for the future. Is there anybody here who has gotten better after trying to reroute their life? Is it possible?",depression
"I’m a depressed therapist I’m a psychologist and depressed. I feel so bad for my clients. I have to go to work because how else am I supposed to afford life?

EDIT:   Thank you to everyone who posted. I just met with two clients and feel like I really helped both of them. I almost called in sick today but coming in was the best thing for me to do!  I think sometimes I have an unrealistic view of my work. Like I’m supposed to say the right thing every moment and magically make suffering go away. But small changes are big eventually. ",depression
"I’m sick of being told “That’s Life” I’ve been depressed for a majority of my life now. I’ve figured out how to manage and function despite wanting to just quit. 
On rare occasions I end up going to bed and just forgetting about it all to get away from responsibilities despite the consequences. 
I’m still alive. 
Whenever I vent my frustrations I’m told “that’s life” which to me sounds like “I don’t care.” 
Or that I’m too negative and that this is just a stage and things will get better. Or to change my perspective.
None of these have worked cause at the end of the day I’m still facing the same bullshit that is my life and struggling to catch a break. I work from the moment the sun comes up all the way into the night. School hasn’t done anything for me or propelled me forward in life. 

That’s life but I’m supposed to pretend it’s ok when I’m clearly not ok?? I’m stuck in this stupid cycle hoping something will come around just to be denied something good because “that’s life and the time will come eventually.” Eventually as in probably not within my life time. I feel so hopeless and it’s ridiculous to subject myself to these thoughts. I haven’t had a moment where I can just be without the day having the be in preparations for work and school. 

Recently I’ve gotten a haircut which completely destroyed my self image. I’m such an idiot because I did it out of impulse and imagined that it would look good on me. 
I feel like people are lying when they say it looks good because I end up having to explain the whole reasoning behind cutting my hair with some made up bullshit like “it was damaged and extremely unhealthy” then they give me unsolicited advice on what I should’ve done with my hair. That just confirms they were lying because if it was truly fine then there shouldn’t be a “what I should’ve done instead.” 
I don’t want to go out any more or show my face to anyone that may know me because I already had this same stupid conversation about my new hair so many times as work already and a few acquaintances who clearly don’t look at me the same way anymore cause I look ugly now. 
I just wanted to look good for once but did something stupid. 
I don’t like looking at my reflection and I wake up disappointed because I look different and happier in my dreams. 

God. This sucks so much. I feel so alone and trapped. Don’t even want to go outside and my self esteem is in the basement under bedrock. So fucking stupid ",depression
"Is it normal for someone with depression doesn't reply messages for half a year? My friend who has severe depression has been ignoring my messages for half a year. I sent him messages about once or twice per month. Sometimes I asked him if he is feeling OK, sometimes I shared the funny picture of my pet. I also shared with him some news that he might be interested in. I also told him it is OK if he just doesn't want to reply, I will be here whenever he wants to talk or needs any help. However, he never replied. Last month, I went to his city and asked him if he wants to hang out and he still didn't reply. I know he is alive but just didn't reply my messages. Is this really because of depression or he just don't want to be my friend anymore? Did I do anything wrong?",depression

edit: I am still here, I actually was planning on doing it on my way to work, but while talking about it with some of you I got to work without doing it and I'm feeling better.
I will seek help and try to live longer, thanks to everyone, sorry for making you worry

edit 2: to anyone who thinks I did this for attention, I'm so sorry you think that, but I have friends and family, I just don't feel comfortable opening up about any of this with them, it's easier to do so here, even if it feels silly.

edit 3: thanks for all the kind comments, I read all of them, if I don't reply to some it's because I'm at work, but I see you all and I appreciate it a lot",depression
When you’re truly depressed.. Nothing or anyone excites you anymore. Not one single person can turn you on. Music doesn’t mean anything at all. Food is all the same and places don’t make a difference. Too lazy to speak and too lazy to explain things. Your room starts to feel like a jail cell. You start to notice the same things happening over and over each year. Things will never be the same… things will never change for you without some serious effort towards personal growth… I’m starting to give up on standards and expectations. I’m just floating before I drown.,depression

"I've been depressed my entire life. They lied. Getting older doesn't make it better. I've never been completely happy . From the time of consciousness, I've never been happy. As a matter of fact I've always been sad. Internally lonely. Delusioned. No mental peace. 

Each year as I got older, my depression would reach certain heights. Get more extreme. 

Around 19 years old, one morning, I woke up and decided I wanted to die. I chugged bunches of sleeping pills and some liquor I found in the kitchen cabinet. I then went back to sleep. I would've succeeded, honestly. My grandma and mom came back from the grocery store . My grandma had somehow made it into my room and accosted me into the bathroom tub . Threw me into some cold water. 

I threw up a bunch. That was the second time I had committed suicide. 

I'm 25 and it's not better. I have moments where I burst in tears. I also realized I'm truly alone. When you're a teenager, you attend school by force. You get to still have some interaction amongst people. Though when you get older, its not like that at all. You can go days and months without speaking to anyone and anyone speaking to you. People can ignore you. Not read your text. People can reject you. As you get older. So reaching out for help can absolutely be useless. 

I don't know what to think anymore. I don't know what to do. I'm kinda tired of it. Trying to find something to pull me out of my mental issues. They never last long. How can someone spend their entire life trying to convince themselves that they should keep living ? How do you convince someone of such a thing and continue to do it over and over and over again. Isn't it a tiresome thought. Who in all sanity should have to make themselves feel like life is worth it? 

That's a sick existence.",depression
"Changed meds now Everyone thinks I'm on Cr*ck C*caine🙃 Hi all so I switched anxiety meds a month back and dropped 40 pounds! Plus exercise I was really starting to gain body confidence.

Well im at work rn I've just been informed by a old coworker who really cares alot about me, older lady real sweet.that it's being spread around that I'm on crack now, and i shouldnt be doing that. I was like HUH!? I've confirmed with like 5 other ppl that this is what's being said about me..

I tried explaining best I could without giving away medical info cause I shouldn't need to and that i wasnt on drugs. But apparently folks that knew me when I was big have attributed my sudden weight loss to crack addiction and its spread around now..

Wtf man. Why are ppl like this, I got ppl that I've known since 9yo that recently ive noticed won't even come near me at work now (grocery store) and i find out its cause they think I'm some kinda tweaker now and that shit really hurts..

"I was born solely as my parents needed a 'boy' I am a 32yr old Korean dude, simply born due to my parents' selfishness to satisfy my dad's parents and to not to look as fallen behind within Korean society.

My mom married my dad to live better as her family was really poor. They had the first baby and it was a girl and my grandparents were not happy had as they needed a 'boy' to keep the bloodline and family going. So they had me 3yrs later.

Lol but guess what? That first girl, my older sis killed herself after severe depression throughout her life. And I am the only child now. The boy who was made due to necessity not because of love.

I don't even miss my sister that much to be honest. My family is just made as they needed one not they wanted it. Honestly I don't think there is 'love' in our family and look at the results - first girl died and the later boy is thinking about dying everyday.

I will never bring a child to this place solely because of my needs. Shame on you mom and dad honestly. You should have never ever met and bring me and my sis to this hell.",depression
