Is it abnormal to get diagnosed with PTSD at a young age?  I‚Äôm currently 17F I got diagnosed with PTSD at 14. A few people have said to me in the past it‚Äôs impossible for me to have PTSD because I‚Äôm only 17. Is it usually something they don‚Äôt diagnose at a young age? Because like I‚Äôm extremely confused? It‚Äôs on my medical records. And I have had a lot of extreme trauma. I definitely meet the criteria I don‚Äôt believe the diagnosis is false? Is it really something that only adults get diagnosed with? ,ptsd
  Why was this so traumatizing ?    I‚Äôve tried everything to forget it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I almost do and then the days over. And it‚Äôs the only thing I can think about. Why is sexual assault so traumatizing ? What is it about it that is upsetting me this much ? I just wanna get over it already. ,ptsd

"my boyfriend says things that make my self hatred issues flair up when my boyfriend gets upset, he tends to be kinda rude to me. i understand he lets his anger get the best of him, but a lot of the time he's just so disrespectful to me for no reason and it makes me feel like shit. today he was talking about how he encountered some asshole workers at subway, and processed to talk about how he got scammed out of his order. i told him i'm sorry stuff didn't work out there and he proceeded to say how they should fire
""his mexican ass"" idk what being mexican has to do with it, but he said he's also never met a kind hearted mexican. i'm mexican. and when i jokingly responded with ""i'm not kind hearted?"" he liked my message and left me on read.

i know we had a rocky past when we first started dating, because i was struggling with creating distance with my rapist ex boyfriend, so i was an ass to him when we first met. and i've apologized over and over and over for it, hell, even went to the mental hospital over it, and still, he doesn't seem to want to move on for something he's ""forgiven"" me for, and it makes me so suicidal. but i can't tell him that, i don't want him to worry or feel like i'm manipulating him. but it's eating me alive, and i might relapse again tonight.

is it valid for me to feel so hurt by his words? i know i should just ignore it since he's just being moody, but i get emotional over everything way too easy. i just want him to tell me he doesn't hate me, so i don't assume it so easily",ptsd

"I don't want to heal; I don't want to be real? Diagnosed with PTSD after an assault in 2022. I'm not having flashbacks anymore or active symptoms, and I can maintain a normal, successful life. But I've been dissociated constantly ever since. I'm so far away from other people and I'm just floating through life. I barely remember what I ate 2 hours ago. I feel like I'm in a dream and I'm just waiting to wake up.

I've looked at workbooks to heal but it all comes back to grounding and being in your body. When I try to, I have this horrible, intense dread. It feels animalistic, like the blind panic of a cat when you stick it in a carrier and take it to the vet. Just this feeling of ""get me out of here"". I don't want to be here, in the real world.

What is the point of healing? I can be numb and not feel anything like I am now -- or I can try to heal and go through hell getting there, for questionable benefit at best.

Can anyone relate? Is it worth it on the other side?",ptsd
"Immense headache after traumatic event. Is this normal?  So today, i spent a whole hour locked inside my house with my baby alone trying to keep her from crying or making noise and trying to keep the dogs from barking because a crackhead was trying to break in. It took a whole HOUR for the police to show up. I called 911 and told them about the man walking around my house banging on my windows and trying to open my door and how I was home alone with my baby. 
Right after they arrested him, I suddenly got a headache that hasn't gone away (5 hours later). I'm still super on edge and can't calm down. 
This scenario has played in my head ONCE and i never thought it would happen. but it did and now im scared and traumatized of being home alone at any time with my baby. 
I went out about 2 hours ago to the store alone (left baby with my mom) and saw 3 more crackheads yelling at cars and being weird. It made me even more anxious. 
I don't live in a bad area. I live in what's supposedly the ""Mini Beverly Hills"" and have always felt safe here. But recently I don't even feel safe walking in daylight to the park. ",ptsd
I wish I could take criticism better I posted a story about something traumatic I went through on aitah using an alternate account. The first comment and only comment was somebody asking if this is real and talked about me being the asshole and accused me of playing victim. I just wish I could let it roll of off me but not being believed and being accused of playing the victim is a major trigger of mine. I deleted it instead of defending myself because I was too scared that it would be taken the wrong way again because being accused of attention seeking and being manipulative is another major trauma trigger for me. I just hate being a coward and wish that I could take it alot better when somebody has a negative opinion of me or doesn‚Äôt believe me.,ptsd
"I had to beg my abuser who I had gone no contact with for some money so I could avoid getting evicted and I'm completely collapsing now CW: small mention of r//pe and csa at some point I guess


my financial situation is the worst it's ever been. I have agoraphobia (surprise, surprise, thanks to my abuse) and it's completely destroyed my life. I haven't been able to hold down a job in a long time, my savings are completely emptied, and I'm living month to month in the worst way. I couldn't even scrape together the funds for $31 until the FIRST this month.
I'm on section 8, they pay everything but that and I STILL couldn't get it together until the fucking day it was due. not only was that super stressful, but while panicking, I sent my mother a money request on PayPal.

my mother, who tried multiple times to molest me as a child.
my mother, who didn't take me to the doctor for 7 years and then tried to gaslight me into believing I had autism to explain my social anxiety after years of isolation.
my mother, who still believes I'm lying if I mention any of these things.

she sent me the money, and she was the reason why I'm not evicted and homeless right now.

I think that the stress of going the entire month not sure if I'll stay housed and having to kiss her ass for money has completely broken me honestly. I can't sleep at night. I didn't go to bed until 5 am last night. I woke up four times *screaming* from nightmares, always about being trapped with her again and everyone trying to gaslight me into believing she never abused me.

I can't sleep. I'm barely eating, too. i'm barely taking care of myself, brushing my teeth barely happens, I'm missing appointments, I missed every food bank this week because I can't eake up early enough.

honestly I feel fucking broken
 and you know what's even worse?? I don't think I'll be able to stop myself from continuing to ask her for money now that I know it's an option. I'm very hungry all the time because I can't keep the fridge stocked and I can't stand it .

I don't have any friends either . i'm isolated totally because of stupid agoraphobia.

I need to talk to my therapist, I know that, but I wasn't able to see her this week.... I desperately needed sleep after not sleeping for 24 hours on our scheduled day, rescheduled our session, and then she got very ill and had to cancel. and their office isn't even open on weekends so I have to wait till at least Monday to get in. 

this is a vent but honestly if anyone had any advice on what to do to feel better I'd take that too. I'm not really sure admitting myself to a hospital or things like that are options right now though. 

im. so. tired.",ptsd
"""You need to hate yourself more to get over your anxiety"" That's a real thing a real-life therapist said to me (like a renowned one with a doctorate who's made television appearances). 

Screw you David (not real name). I hate you for taking one look at me as a 16 year old child and saying ""Yep that's anxiety, doesn't matter it only started up after an incident \[that he himself called traumatizing\], she can't possibly have PTSD because she's a child and children are resilient.""  I hate you for telling me ""You can't have nightmares because if you did then you would've lead with that,"" like sorry I wasn't doing therapy perfectly as a teenager. 

And screw you for telling me that the solution to this 'anxiety' was me hating myself more! ""If you hate yourself more then you'll feel compelled to change"" no dude instead I just hated myself more. 100% could've been avoided without your interference. ",ptsd

I've been in PTSD treatment for a while, and also disassociation separately, but it hasn't seemed to help me very much. One seems to make the other one go up when you fix the one of them, like they're on opposite sides of the spectrum.

"How to cope with being abandoned by the one you love My ex boyfriend recently abruptly broke up with me a few weeks ago because of mental health issues he was unable to communicate, a difficult job and abuse at home. He insists i did nothing wrong, I also can appreciate he was quite avoidant attachment type which has been hard for me as an anxious attachment type from abandonment trauma. 
I am really struggling to cope with the fact he‚Äôs abandoned me - regardless of the reason. It was really abrupt and also really upsetting to see him that unwell and that I was unknowingly a burden to him. We‚Äôve talked it out, I‚Äôve been given all the answers I need, he broke up with me in the kindest most compassionate way, but regardless i am still extremely disregulated and struggling and given me a big ptsd flare up for weeks now, with little signs of improvement. I‚Äôve done all the healthy things - reach out to others, exercise, eat well, go outside, distract yourself, attempt to convince myself I deserve better, get on waiting lists for therapy, go no contact, get support from charities, try to be my own boyfriend. But I still end up feeling chronically unsafe and scared, I‚Äôm in my final year of uni and im getting into dangerous territory with my fine art degree reaching nearly a month being away (every time I go in, I have a flare up/flashback to when I was a child, or when I make work, I think it subconsciously triggers things) and I recieved a diagnosis for ptsd yesterday.
To know the most important person in you life has chosen to live it without you, to be not as terrified of loosing you as you were about them, is a really difficult feeling with my past of abandonment I experienced as a child after facing SA. I would be really greatful if anyone who struggles with a similar thing in ptsd what they do to manage feelings of abandonment and self regulate. Thanks so much ",ptsd
"ptsd/ substance abuse  Even before ""the event"" earlier this year, I have a litany of other traumatizing events that I have experienced throughout the course of my life before-hand.
I have been viciously depressed. I grieve for the woman who didn't know this kind of violence. 
Alcohol has helped me and it has sabotaged me. 
 To feel numb feels like a gift. Of course, everything it takes away...

"I was attacked by a stranger trying to steal my dog. Now I‚Äôm just full of resentment and I never want to leave my house again. Tw; gun violence 

A little over a month ago, | (28F) was walking my dog behind my house, a neighborhood where l've lived for years without ever feeling unsafe. Suddenly, a man wearing a ski mask holding a gun appeared from around the corner, pointing it at my face and demanded I hand over my dog. (Honey a 3 year old French Bulldog)
Something took over me and I instantly refused and used my body to protect her. He pulled the trigger right at my face, but nothing happened. He seemed surprised and tried again but it still didn‚Äôt go off. Then he lunged and started hitting me in the head with the gun, telling me to stop screaming and trying to rip her away her from me. I kept screaming, and eventually, he fled. Honey and I were able to run in to a neighbor's house for safety.

For the first four weeks, I was in shock, unable to fully process what actually happened. I started therapy, and things felt ok enough that I was eager to jump back into work. Im absolutely terrified to walk my dogs or leave my house with them now but that didn‚Äôt come to much of a surprise given what happened. 

But the past week I‚Äôve become irritable and deeply resentful toward people close to me who haven't reached out or shown any support. So many friends and people from our local frenchie meet up group have acted as if this never happened and tbh really don‚Äôt seem to care at all. I‚Äôve only getting 3 -4 hours of sleep a night this week and during the day at work I felt nauseous and had body aches.  But I assumed I was just getting sick or something. On my day off today, I felt completely fine! however, as soon as was in bed and thought about having to put on a face and be away from honey at work tomorrow.. instantly all my symptoms, especially the nausea, hit me like a train and I started to have flash backs which lead to a panic attack. I definitely see now that this is PTSD.

I'm wondering if the resentment I feel toward people who haven't shown any support will eventually go away or if it's something I'll carry forever? I don't necessarily want to hold on to it, but thinking that l could have died and people close to me and honey don't seem to care makes me feel a level of hurt I can‚Äôt even describe and tbh I don‚Äôt know if I even want people like that in my life. 

I work two jobs, but my boyfriend has been incredibly supportive, encouraging me to slow down and focus on healing while he takes care of bills etc. I‚Äôm considering quitting one of my jobs, but I‚Äôve only been there for three months, and as a chronic people-pleaser, I feel extremely guilty about leaving. I‚Äôm also struggling with how to even explain my decision since I‚Äôve appeared perfectly fine since my attack. üòî",ptsd
"Without going into too much detail - maybe someone here will understand  Do you think the other person involved has PTSD too? They saw what I saw with their own eyes, just from a different perspective of them looking at me doing these things to me vs me watching these things happen to me. I always wonder if they have it too. Even though they were the perpetrator, do they have flashbacks? It must have been horrifying on that end too, right? If it was scary enough for me to ‚Äúsee‚Äù and experience, was it also scary for them? And this is not sympathizing. This is a question like from a PTSD standpoint. I often think the perpetrator just ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have ptsd‚Äù and I‚Äôm left with it, but is it possible they have it too?
I still feel an aura to them even though they did something so horrific I can‚Äôt excuse or forgive. We live miles away. States away. Yet I‚Äôm here still wondering if they have PTSD or if I‚Äôm raw dogging this alone.

"Objectification/pressuring/coercion triggers Hi all, my first post here. I've been in therapy since early this year and was diagnosed with PTSD related to prior sexual abuse. I've been seeing a therapist and we're beginning prolonged exposure therapy. I also got into a new relationship within the last year and it's been really difficult for me to manage these new symptoms.

*Trigger warnings of SA and self harm

When I was 15, I began dating a guy a few years older than me. This was my first sexual relationship and I was excited and very interested in sex for the first time. Throughout our almost 2 year relationship, we definitely had your average vanilla teenage sex but mixed in was a lot of emotional and sexual abuse that I've been uncovering this year. I've always had a knowing that I was sexually abused by this person but specific memories didn't really come to mind until this year when I was retraumatized. I have had several sexual partners since this abusive relationship and didn't really feel triggered but now the triggers seem everywhere.

During this relationship, I experienced a lot of pressuring and coercion. Sometimes he would accept my no and cheat as a result. Sometimes he would threaten to self harm/commit suicide if I didn't do as asked then show me proof. Sometimes he would just do things during sex and I felt I didn't have a choice. That fawning response still haunts me and used to confuse me if I was actually assaulted or not especially because it was over a long period. I was coerced into complying with nude photos as an underage teen. I was taken remote places in his car and had to comply to sex, I was yelled at during and afterwards if I didn't seem into it because I was dissociating and waiting for it to be over. I would try to push him off of me or stop him and he would pin my face and arms down as he was much larger than me. 

I have had intrusive images, nightmares and hyper vigilance from my current boyfriend overstepping a boundary during sex 7 months ago. I got angry at first then disbelief and betrayal, crying and just numb, not wanting to be touched at all. The next time we had sex I was so scared and almost in tears when in that position. I struggle with feeling like he really understood the gravity of the situation for me and I comforted him a lot afterwards. He hasn't crossed a boundary again and we have good conversations about what we both want in bed. I was having a lot of hyper vigilance and rumination about being unsafe and taken advantage of by him after that. I would dissociate at any sign of being unsafe. My therapist initially thought I had OCD. Symptoms have improved with therapy. Once that settled, I'm now really aware of my triggers but having all the discomfort, unease and scared feelings coming with them. I know these are signs of progress but it's still so difficult to be in a relationship and have this happening so suddenly and trying to to explain my pulling back or irritability related to it.

I feel my partner is sometimes supportive and he understands I have PTSD. Other times I feel like he just keeps going and going with the sex talk and it becomes really triggering for me. Sex is very important to him and really makes him feel connected. Repeatedly bringing up how hot I am or explicit language about acts on my body can feel very objectifying and pressuring for me. What's prompted this post is him asking what panties I'm wearing 3 days this week and getting really hyped to have sex again. I feel disgusted, uncomfortable or scared he'll be mad at me instead of being turned on. It makes anticipated sex feel less exciting and more pressuring and like I owe it. I've felt scared about being pressured into things I don't want to do even though he's reassured me he does not want that. But he has made jokes about this, which feels triggering and makes me scared.

I feel my trauma has really impacted my comfort levels with any sexual  exploration now even though I have in the past. I'm sad and frustrated that this happened over 10 years ago and like I can't have a normal sex life like everyone else. During sex I can thankfully enjoy it most of the time. 

Just posting as I'm wondering if others experience a lot of sensitivity around anything that feels like pressure or objectification. I'm realizing how much the emotional abuse really played into what I experienced. I appreciate anyone reading. I move forward knowing there's hope to a normal life again. ",ptsd

I already eat healthy, take vitamins and minerals. I manage my breathing and been seeing a therapist for 2 years. On waiting list again for cbt.

Tried being active in my hobby. I used to have this as an escape but it does require energy.

Socializing makes things worse from the stress of being dissociated around people. 
Makes me feel incompetent. I even slurr when I speak, as if I'm drunk.

"How can i cope with this and stop doubting myself? So I (F18) have had a really unpleasant experience which made me super vigilant when it comes to anything sexual (probably considered secondary PTSD, i've read messages of my mom describing how she got r\*ped and sexually abused when she was a child, but this is a whole other story).  
I started getting flashbacks of my dad touching me when i was younger (mostly grabbing my butt and spanking me), I also kind of remember him touching my private parts in one occasion. I'm not so sure about this one but i do remember him lifting my robe once while i was sleeping to look at me.

He has always done lots of commenting of my body, i don't wanna go into detail but it makes me super uncomfortable when he does it. One time when i asked him to stop (i kind of said it in an ""impolite manner"") he got angry and defensive (literally grabbed my arm and dragged me into my room and was about to hit me), so i just stopped arguing and instead i just avoid him as much as I can.

He also looks at me weirdly; I mean he really keeps looking at my body when i talk to him, i don't know whether he does it subconsciously but it really makes me uncomfortable (I can't see a reason why you'd keep looking up and down on someone that's talking to you, like just look into their eyes?), he once even ""checked me out"" and literally bit his lip and gave me the most gross lusty look I've ever seen on a man's face.

All of the shit he did/does combined with what i vaguely remember makes me truly despise him. It makes me feel so vulnerable and unsafe, it really distresses me that i get nightmares about it. I don't know how to think of him anymore, in my head he's just a gross person that i wouldn't ever wanna call my father.  
On the other hand i keep thinking but what if he doesn't mean it and i'm just interpreting his actions wrongly. What if i'm just projecting what happened to my mom upon myself.  
He's kind of nice to me and it looks like he cares about me. He's also really clingy and demanding, he gets pissed off when i avoid him so i have to compensate for it from time to time.

The thing is we interact normally, all of what he does/did is/was very causal, I just brush it off most of the time and I think he thinks his behavior is normal. We have discussed things related to sexual abuse (like seeing on the news that some girl got molested by a family member for example) and he does criticize or at least frown upon that kinda behavior (he's fairly religious, or at least he thinks he is). Although his actions really distress me, i can't help but think that he innocently does the shit he does and i'm the one overreacting here.",ptsd
"Prison f@#ked me up mentally  I was incarcerated for 5 years 4 years in gen pop 1 year in the hole. I've been home for 3 years and I feel disconnected from everyone,  I try to hide my true feelings from people and so far it's working but there are days when I feel so depressed so lonely I've had countless jobs that I can't keep because of my depression and I make up excuses as to why I had to quit always masking the truth from people.

"Struggling with nightmares and sleep paralysis. I (20MtF) was SA‚Äôd twice when I was 19. I‚Äôve been struggling with it more and more. I keep getting nightmares where I wake up again and again and again on the same day with sleep paralysis mixed in. These sleep problems only started after I was assaulted. 

Last night I had a dream where I kept waking up in my house, but it was a lot darker than usual. I knew I was in a dream and I would try to manipulate the dream to scare me to get me to really wake up but nothing would work. At one point I fell and then I was in my bed again. Another time I ran into my mom‚Äôs room to try and get her to wake up but then I‚Äôd ‚Äúwake up‚Äù in my bed again. 

A couple times during this I really did wake up but with sleep paralysis. I remember desperately trying to move and keep myself awake. I didn‚Äôt want to go back into my dream. 

I get dreams like this frequently now. They scare me and make me feel powerless and trapped. Is this normal with trauma?

But whenever it's night time and I'm alone I just feel so unsafe and uneasy. Like something bad is gonna happen.

"I'm scared to go to class because of one of my classmates I have a classmate who I was almost sure has a crush on me. I've made it very clear last week that I am not interested in him like that and that I am not ready to date. He said, ""I get it, that's totally fine. We can just be friends. I really enjoy our conversations and don't want to lose you as a friend""

Today, we were studying at the library and he was like, ""Why won't you let anyone get close to you? I've been watching you and I can tell that you're trying to keep everyone at a distance."" I told him to stop asking questions he's not ready to hear the answer to, then we went back to studying. A few minutes later, he asked me if I would ever have a one night-stand with someone and I said, ""Absolutely not. Can we stop talking about this? I thought you wanted to work on this paper we have to write."" He stopped for a little bit, then asked me if I was a virgin. I didn't answer so he started talking about how he wants to be someone's first and to take a girl's virginity. Something about the way he said it really triggered me and I think he saw the look on my face because he asked if I regret my first time. I just started crying and told him that it was forced on me, that I didn't have a choice, that I kept saying no, that the man who took my virginity was older, bigger, and stronger than me

As embarrassing as my breakdown was, I hoped it would be enough to get him to stop asking questions and just write the damn paper. But no. He kept asking me if he can kiss me, then he started talking about how he only comes to class to see my face and how he can't stop thinking about all the things he wants to do to me. I ran out of there and told him that I was done, that I didn't care if he got a zero on this paper and that I actually hoped he did. It took me several hours just to stop shaking

He's never acted this way before, but now I'm scared to even go to class :(",ptsd

"Red flag? 
So I had my first session with a new therapist, I was very anxious about it as my last one was very dismissive of my past (long story but basically I‚Äôm sure I there‚Äôs CSA there I just can‚Äôt remember it clearly) anyway I‚Äôve been diagnosed as having ptsd (although I think cptsd is more fitting) via the nhs because of this, now my childhood wasn‚Äôt great, mum and dad split up, dad was abusive and used to beat mum in front of me, I was terrified of him, he took me away and told me all my family had died and he was all I had left, this was all around 4 years old, anyway I didn‚Äôt talk about the CSA as it was our first session and my last therapist basically told me I was lying about it (why anyone would I have no idea) all because her hypnotherapy didn‚Äôt produce any memories. Anyway, my new therapist told me she doubts I have ptsd as that what you get from going to war. She said she‚Äôs worked with people with ptsd for 15years and she doesn‚Äôt think I fit it. Do I continue with her or cut her off? She seemed really nice otherwise, and I didn‚Äôt help myself by telling her everything, but then I don‚Äôt have clear memories of the CSA, just very strong feelings and what others have told me about my behaviour as a child and little things I can remember that could point to it, I really don‚Äôt know, is she right, could I not have ptsd? Just a lot of trauma?",ptsd

"Title: Is it normal to feel more anxious and triggered after opening up about my assault? I‚Äôve been carrying this secret for two years, and I finally told my boyfriend about what happened. I was assaulted by a relative when I was extremely drunk, and I‚Äôve been too scared to talk to anyone about it‚Äîespecially my family. After all this time, telling him felt like a huge weight off my shoulders at first. He‚Äôs been amazing‚Äîso kind, patient, and understanding. I honestly feel closer to him now that I‚Äôve opened up, but I didn‚Äôt expect the aftermath to hit me so hard.

Since I told him, I‚Äôve started recalling more details of the assault, and now I feel like I‚Äôm reliving parts of it more often. I‚Äôve been triggered by things I didn‚Äôt think would affect me‚Äîlike when a man stands too close or gets behind me unexpectedly. I start to feel panicked, anxious, and out of control. I also keep having nightmares, and I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm more on edge, snapping at my boyfriend over little things that normally wouldn‚Äôt matter.

The worst part is, even though I‚Äôve told someone, I still feel so alone. My boyfriend is amazing and supportive, but I still feel like there‚Äôs this part of me that‚Äôs buried deep down, and I don‚Äôt know how to get past it. I want to stop feeling like this, but sometimes I just can‚Äôt shake it. I‚Äôve tried therapy but I feel like I‚Äôm pretty self aware lmao.. so therapy doesn‚Äôt really help. I also have adhd so my mind will repeat stuff over and over. 

Is this normal? I‚Äôm having these mood swings, feeling anxious all over again, and getting triggered randomly.

"i made a little den in my wardrobe for whenever i can't sleep at night (aka every fuckin night LOL) Tbh i don't know whether this will work or not. over the past few months i've realised that the core reason i can't get to sleep at night is bc - of many things - my body doesn't physically feel safe enough to sleep. As in, \*i will die in this position\*, kind of thing.

I realised from reading about other people's stuff that it's not always a bad thing to 'give in' to that kind of fear, to actually play along with it and allow urself to go sleep somewhere else, even if it's on the bare floor. That's something I've never allowed myself to do.

I'm at the stage where I'm not trying to cure shit, just putting in little adaptations to avoid all the stuff that causes me so much trouble, putting it lightly. 

So it might not be on a therapist's 'success' list to be unable to sleep in a bed in a normal way, but i'm going to see what happens with this. 

I've made a little den where i can drag my pillows and duvet and blankets into the open wardrobe, and basically hide underneath all the stuff but with the lights on lmao. gonna think about getting some fairy lights.

"Hypersexuality and being a little confused  So, last year, I 21F was S/A and then a few months later robbed. I already had a history of sexual abuse beforehand, I have been in therapy, and thankfully, it's helped me from being hypersexual. However, I did have a moment of weakness and hooked up with a 49M. I do know the age gap is horrible, and I regret it, not here to justify. However, I feel like having sex with him has been in my flashbacks?? Nothing traumatic happened, and it was 100% consensual, I know now it was creepy, but the sex is something I said yes to. The flashbacks started a couple weeks after and not during, and all I'm seeing is you get triggered WHILE have consenting sex not weeks after. I honestly feel disgusting and horrible and am just really confused and want advice or to know other people have gone through something similar because I feel alone and ashamed. My therapist and I are doing EDMR therapy next session to help with the sexual traumas.

"help :( It's cooked tbh . And I am well aware that I am contributing to this situation.¬†So I was in a really fucked up relationship last year. My ex was doing it all, all kinds of violence. But that wasn't what broke me. I broke up with him and he contacted all my friends to send them nudes of me. He blackmailed me to my employer and I got dismissed without further notice. He blackmailed me to my government. His claims: I'm a prostitute. I'm on drugs. I publish porn. I publish child pornography of my own child, I put my child on drugs. He put some videos of my child on pornhub that he took when my child was roaming around in a diaper on a sunny day. This is all really horrible per se. He nuked my whole social circle. But I was like fuck it and started a new life. I started dating my partner. Our anniversary is in 5 days. Right now he is working a lot and it throws me back to when he was working a lot in February but he was so shitty. He just came to eat what I cooked,To put dirty dishes in the sink. He also was using my computer cos his one was broken at the time so I was really isolated too. Whenever he had free time he went out with his uni friends (without me). In April I found out he said ily to all his female friends (and the girls he went out drinking with all the time). I have massive cptsd. Partly from what I went through in my previous relationship but the fact that he kicked me while I was on the ground amplifies my cptsd and just throws it completely out of dimension. Next month it will be a year ago that he treated me like shit, too. I was on a vacation with my mom shortly after we started dating and he ghosted me, partied the whole time, slept over at friends, battery on 1%. Later I went through his phone that he was texting everyone (including random girls like one for days 247 even) but me and he even gave his ex a birthday present for her bday last December. This I only found out in may. This year my birthday comes around and he's too broke toCome up with a gift on time. It was in September. Every time my cptsd is triggered I shut him out. And he has no EQ to know how to deal with it and everything just gets worse like right now.He has a lot of work right now and even tho he isn't acting like he used to but I keep having intrusive thoughts, spiralling thoughts like all the bad events accumulating in an endless loop and I know it's my trauma. He has no clue what is going on with me but I'm so on fire I literally wanna pack my bags and just leave the country with my son. Our anniversary is in 5 days and all I can think is I can't do another year like this. December will come and I will be so depressed about the anniversary of memories. And I shut him out I won't even talk to him because I don't feel safe to trust him with the pain I have because of what he did to me after my previous relationship. He witnessed it all. He was my friend during that time and the fact that he did that after I was so maliciously abused is hurting me more than the actual abuse. I don't wanna play victim here. I know I'm dysfunctional and have been. As I said I'm on fire idk how to snap out of it",ptsd

"Feels painful to move  Lately it's felt painful to move at times. I get really shut down and even just getting up and walking can feel physically painful. I can tell it's coming from trauma and getting so overwhelmed or feeling really unsafe it's like my body just shuts down. The worst part of it can be if I try to push through it I can become even more triggered, feel even more unsafe. Sometimes sleeping feels like the best thing to do. If I try to push through sometimes it can help a bit but other times it makes it worse, it's like my body is yelling at me to stay still. The problem with this is that it is happening quite frequently it's getting hard to get stuff done and look after myself. Does anyone else struggle with this?  I do have health issues but I believe these symptoms currently are coming from trauma, it's happened before I developed health issues when trauma would come up. ",ptsd
"  Anyone have any idea why he SA me over clothes ?    I have an idea‚Ä¶.. like there was someone in the house who could‚Äôve heard me if I screamed. So that‚Äôs probably why‚Ä¶.. or because he didn‚Äôt have a condom n didn‚Äôt want DNA evidence‚Ä¶. Or maybe he was also like afraid I‚Äôd leave him n so he couldn‚Äôt date (and control) me again‚Ä¶..

  I‚Äôm so grateful that I wasn‚Äôt raped, but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  holding me down with his legs n aggressively SA me over clothes is kinda weird. 

  And disturbing‚Ä¶.. it‚Äôs so clear that he knew I didn‚Äôt want sex idk.  Or he would‚Äôve and idk maybe he was afraid to injure me (or afraid of me yelling in pain smh. And knew I would. And i believe‚Ä¶. he almost did after but he stopped himself I think. Thats the truth. I swear he put his hand under my shirt and down‚Ä¶. Like by my waist he almost went further after but thank god he didn‚Äôt. He must‚Äôve seen the fear in my eyes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ and how I was just like in shock not doing anything back idk. 

  Why does this confuse me ? I sadly think I mean duhh he wanted sex n that was made disturbingly obvious. Idk how tf he made that aggressively clear OVER OUR CLOTHES WTF.   

  The one that really terrifies me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ maybe he just simply knew I didn‚Äôt want sex n I was a virgin. He knew which lines to cross so I‚Äôd stay and question myself and even make excuses because it‚Äôs ‚Äújust‚Äù over clothes. He knew I didn‚Äôt want to. That I wasn‚Äôt ready.

I do not ever go into his bathroom. The only time I‚Äôve done so is when I was drunk and decided to apologize for not finding him quicker and feeling like I‚Äôm to blame for his death due to me taking him to the hospital months before to find out a tumor was growing inside of him.

"Anxious abusive husband This is basically a vent.  After feeling this way for years, and every professional I see asking why I am still married, I know what I have to do.

Most recently I sought out adhd testing, sure it is something wrong with my brain.  The psychologist is adamant I can‚Äôt have adhd because it is developmental and that I have ptsd caused by my husband.  Not earth shattering considering he had extreme reactions including punching holes in our house walls and leaving erratically saying he was going to commit suicide, leaving me with a small 2 year old crying.

I left this summer when his aggressive behavior made my kids cry and scared, not to mention my nervous system.  He would not let me leave or go without constant communication.  He swore he would change, found quite literally 4 therapists he was seeing all at the same time.  I asked him to leave so we could come home, he agreed, then did not leave.  

Now it‚Äôs back to the old ways.  His presence triggers me so I try to peacefully avoid him and protect myself.  This morning he came home(I never know when to expect this so I gave my earplugs handy), said ‚Äúhi‚Äù, I said ‚Äúhi‚Äù, and he said ‚ÄúI said HI‚Äù.  I said I said hi and removed myself to another room.  He came in and said we have some administrative things to take care of.  I say ok, he tells me, I say ok.  He goes upstairs and texts me ‚ÄúI have a few things to get off my chest.  We need to talk later‚Äù.  This elevates me and I tell him it is unfair that he does that especially first thing in the morning.  

I finally just go upstairs to ask him what he needs to get off his chest, extremely elevated at this point.  And he won‚Äôt tell me,  we need to schedule a time to talk later.  I continue to ask him to please just tell me the bullet points.  He refuses and continues to lecture me about how all of this is harder for him because he has an anxious attachment.  He regularly has ‚Äúmeetings‚Äù with me where he is the only one who talks.  Look, I know he has zero care for me, it‚Äôs all about control.  Shortly later he slammed a door very loudly to the point both my kids said they were scared.  

How can I survive in this environment while making a plan to leave?  My nervous system is shot, but resisting him makes everything so much worse.  I hate him in the depths of my soul.  Please be gentle.

"Re-experiencing and re-enacting SA. Why and how to stop?  I have been battling with PTSD -which i just discovered this week- since i was 20 years old. 
Lately, i have been losing control on everything, my sext and masturbation addiction gonna uncontrollably. My life quality is declining since i stopped working for academic reasons. 
Things were okay back then, as i occupied -smothered- myself with everything. But now i am not doing okay at all. 

I have been SA when i was around 8 I believe by an older cousin. I noticed that my sexual phantasies and behavior is somehow very similar to my SA experience- which is awful and nauseating-, it‚Äôs like i was intentionally re-experiencing and re-enacting the sexual abuse. My whole sexual behavior revolves around this.

My question is: i need an explanation why do i keep re experiencing the sexual abuse and turn it into a pleasurable experience, i fking hate this, i want it to stop.
And how can i stop it from progressing and effecting my sexual behavior. It‚Äôs becoming self destructive.  ",ptsd
"How much do medications help you?  I saw my psychiatrist today and he was quite upset at me for not wanting to increase my medicine dose. He said that his other patients take high doses of 2-3 different meds to feel better.

"I need some help  Apologies its a bit long. I was diagnosed with a disease called Ulcerative Colitis two years ago and was on medication for it to manage the flare ups for roughly a year and a half. It got so bad that I was just passing blood every time I went to the toilet, I was severely anaemic and still going to the gym throught it all. I was called in to the hospital for a blood test, then the day after they said I would have to come in for a 5 day course of IV corticosteroids to try and get it under control. 

So I went in, was admitted to the emergency ward. I was severely dehydrated and in so much pain at this point. I was meant to be in for 5 days, but the steroids didn't work. They tried every other drug they could to try and help me but none worked. I was moved from ward to ward and despite my amazing team of gastroentologists and doctors they still couldn't help. Eventually they told me they would have to operate on me to remove my colon in order to stop me from dying. 

I obviously didn't want to, as it would mean I would have an ileostomy bag which was a big issue for me. However, I had no choice so I had the operation. The first 5 days after the operation went okay, I was in a lot of pain but not unbearable as it was managed by oral morphine and IV paracetamol. The operation was laparascopic, which meant small incisions = less pain. 5 days after my first operation I was in extreme pain. 

It started around 8pm and got worse up until 1am, they gave me every drug they could (IV paracetamol, IV morphine, Oral Morphine, Ketamine, Fentanyl) but nothing would touch the pain. It got so bad I was begging the nurses to kill me or put me under to stop the pain. They took me for a CT scan of my abdomen, and it felt like when I was being taken down there (lying on a hospital bed) every bump was a knife in my abdomen and I thought I was going to die.

They discovered I had a massive build up of fluid and gas in my intestines, and took me down for an emergency operation at 2am, after I had been in unbearable pain for 6 hours. I woke up in the ICU hooked up to 5 different fluids and a morphine PCA. I was told I had suffered from a twisted bowel, which had constricted my stoma and killed a small portion of my small bowel. 

I was in the ICU for 7 days and they were horrendous, I had a NG tube down my nose, a Robinsons Drain in my side and a new scar down my abs. They had not done laparscopic surgery this time as they didn't have time to, and had cut me open to find the problem. As a result of them poking around in my intestines, my stomach had shut down and I had to have it aspirated by the NG tube every 4 hours, and wasn't allowed to eat or drink anything.

Eventually I got out of there and was moves to another ward for a couple weeks before I was discharged. I am getting healthier now, adjusting to my stoma bags. But whenever I hear anything to do with ICU, or hospitals or drugs or painkillers or anything at all that reminds me, it all comes back. Its like I'm right back there again, all the fear and pain and confusion is overwhelming and I can't do anything. I have day dreams about it and nightmares I wake up in a cold sweat. 

The worst part is I don't feel like I have the right to have PTSD, like there are combat vets who have seen the worst a person can see and I have just laid in a hospital for 6 weeks. Anything have any advice on how to deal with this or any tips on how to manage when I have the flashbacks? Any help appreciated. ",ptsd

"Will it be this bad forever? I won't go into detail. Short version is I had a very traumatic childhood and an extremely abusive mother. I moved out at 17, I did alright for a while, mental health tanked in my mid 20s to the point of being put on disability. Now, at 29, the flashbacks and ptsd episodes are coming in. It's constant as of late, episodes so bad I'm vomiting and screaming and sobbing uncontrollably.

"Urges to bite others out of anger normal?  TW: Just to preface I‚Äôve grown up in an extremely emotional volatile household. My mother has borderline personality disorder and father exhibits all narcissistic personality disorder traits but does not have an official diagnosis. I personally have ADHD, PMDD, GA, and some C-PTSD. I often get extremely triggered by my parents and have a hard time calming my emotions and urges. 

Recently (like within the past few years) I‚Äôve started realizing how much my parents manipulate and use me in their wars against each other or for their favor. Safe to say I‚Äôve started resenting them heavily for it as my reliance on them has decreased. I‚Äôve started fighting back a lot.

A terrifying urge I‚Äôve developed when frustrated is to bite them. Like sink my teeth into them to get them to shut up? I‚Äôve never done it and don‚Äôt plan to but when I start seeing red it becomes really hard to control. It‚Äôs kind of insane and I‚Äôm terrified and grossed out by this but genuinely thinking it‚Äôs a trauma response.

But I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm wrong and it might be a precursor to abuse or my propensity to want to abuse others if I get angry at them but don‚Äôt know if this is just standard reactionary abuse behavior. 

I also worry (as insane as it sounds) that it might have something to do with cannibalism? I‚Äôve always liked biting people I love gently but sometimes it‚Äôs gotten a little intense but never to the point where I‚Äôve hurt them. 

I‚Äôm afraid my therapist might put me in an institute or something but know I need to tell her eventually but in the meantime what the hell am I supposed to do? Any good articles or research?

"Am I wrong to be upset T ignored my call for two weeks when I was in distress?  I signed up to do 3 ketamine treatments (one per week) and had to cancel my appointments with my T for those weeks because of scheduling issues. I did the first treatment and it was horrific. It brought up all of this nightmarish trauma and launched me into much worse anxiety and depression. The next day, I called my T and left a message while crying, detailing about how I'm in a really bad place after the first treatment and was wondering if we could meet during my time slot or another one that week. I said it was urgent because I am a mess and don't know whether it's safe for me to go back for the next sessions.

T doesn't call me until two days later and I miss the call. They say they're sorry I'm in a bad spot and that they missed me and they'll try me again next week. I call back within minutes, asking if they can please call me back this week even for a few minutes because next week is my 2nd session and I don't know whether to go back. They don't call me back for TWO weeks so after my 3rd session (I did go back. It was awful) and again I miss the call. They leave a message saying they are only calling back now because they know I have been busy with the ketamine sessions and that they are available to schedule an appointment the following week to resume our sessions and talk about how the ketamine treatments went.

I've had a couple of sessions with T since and I can't let go of how they basically ignored me when I was in need of help.  I can completely understand if they didn't have time for a session when I reached out, but the least they could have done was call me back when I'm in obvious distress for even a minute. At our first session after, all they said was ""I'm sorry we kept missing each other.""",ptsd
"  I‚Äôm promiscuous because of trauma now and I don‚Äôt want to be anymore‚Ä¶..   I‚Äôm not judging anyone who is having casual sex, but clearly it‚Äôs not my thing because I tried to do it and I‚Äôm really bad at not getting feelings. Maybe because I‚Äôm a virgin idk‚Ä¶.. I ended up thinking like if I do something sexual with a couple guys I will just be healed. My trauma won‚Äôt matter anymore. It sort of helped cuz I have had different experiences, but I still haven‚Äôt had any experiences you know positively with anything close to ummm my trauma ‚Ä¶..

  So now I‚Äôm a 26 year old virgin who is also damaged and just fml. It didn‚Äôt help that this guy pretty much said I ‚Äúshould be with someone n deserve someone who can handle my PTSD ‚Äú.  And it‚Äôs fine like I realize I‚Äôm a mess right now he‚Äôs right. I‚Äôm not ready for a relationship‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but I think that just made me feel worse because I was lying to him lying to myself. I did things I now regret like whatever it‚Äôs fine I liked him, but I just feel used . He said from the beginning he wanted causal but then he knew about my SA trauma . He knew n he I guess assumed it‚Äôd be okay cuz I‚Äôm ‚Äúslutty‚Äù. Then I guess later felt bad about it. Whatever.

    Anyway, I can‚Äôt seem to see sexual normally so I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúhooking up‚Äù especially casually is a very good idea. Like I have triggers and literally any mention of sex I just think of my SA. It‚Äôs the only reference I have unfortunately‚Ä¶..

  It helped a bit like I said but it definitely didn‚Äôt like get rid of the pain I‚Äôm feeling. It just made it worse because now I just did these things to make myself like feel anything else and to lower the value of what was stolen from me‚Ä¶.

  He didn‚Äôt exactly take my virginity . He ‚Äújust‚Äù SA me over my clothes, so I feel dramatic being this upset about it, but the way I see it that was my first experience. No he didn‚Äôt take that he didn‚Äôt have actual like PIV sex with me, but my first experience was literally assault and traumatizing. 

  I‚Äôm just not okay right now. And I‚Äôm realizing I became like attached to my rapist after I even kept dating him, because idk I thought it was my fault for not being ready. For not meeting his needs‚Ä¶. 

  Help. I feel so crazy like why is this so traumatizing ? Will I ever feel better and heal from this ? 

  I feel guilty too even wanting a normal sex life after that even wanting something that was so traumatic for me that was so disgustingly like‚Ä¶. forced so now I feel guilty that I‚Äôm even curious to know what normal sex is like.

  I‚Äôm just so depressed. How do I heal from this? And please don‚Äôt tell me to get therapy . I can‚Äôt get therapy yet. 

  And what he did wasn‚Äôt even rape ! It wasn‚Äôt even forcing actual sex. He just did it aggressively but over my clothes so why am I so traumatized ? I know being raped must be like horrible and way different, but I‚Äôm so upset still. ",ptsd

" My first sexual experience was SA and it‚Äôs ruined me‚Ä¶.     My Story 

  This guy I had only been on a couple dates with‚Ä¶.  This was the third date, but we had talked on the phone that‚Äôs it though 3 months. I told him I never did anything sexually I‚Äôm a virgin basically a ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù for lack of better words.  And I was raised like that sex should be if I‚Äôm in love or preferably I should be married. At least I should know the guy really well. Besides that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with sex. I wasn‚Äôt taught much about it. I was taught it was bad pretty much and I didn‚Äôt know it was even normal for women to have urges ? So you get how I felt about it mentally emotionally. Though I did think from the beginning wow I feel like eventually I will have to because he was pressuring me, but too subtly for me to think much of it‚Ä¶.. but whenever he brought it up I got uncomfortable (like our second date and he said I‚Äôd never pressure you or anything and you wouldn‚Äôt do it out of guilt right? Then he just said hey I really like you‚Ä¶. Anyway I only knew him in person for three days before he sexually assaulted me. It was our first day literally first day of dating. 

    So here‚Äôs what happened‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ we were in his car as he pulled into the driveway to his house. I kept saying I‚Äôm looking for somewhere to go and he just ignored me. He suggested we go back inside his house and ‚Äúhang out‚Äù. Stupidly I believed him. He also casually says ‚Äúoh hey my Uncles here‚Äù. 

    I don‚Äôt go inside at first but eventually I do and thinking we‚Äôre gonna hang out. So at first we were just kissing ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. but then he started I guess grinding on me ? I didn‚Äôt know what it was even called at the time or I might‚Äôve just left, but I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time and he seemed nice enough. And I got really nervous. I said I had to go to the bathroom then went back like nah he doesn‚Äôt realize so I just have to tell him. So I tell him I‚Äôm really nervous I need to breathe. I do want to kiss you though.

  So he goes back to kissing me but how he‚Äôs doing it is more‚Ä¶. Intense so I have a panic attack . Eventually he pulled away and just went and sat on the other side of his bed ignoring me.

   He just completely ignored me he wouldn‚Äôt even look at me. I kept trying to tell him I was nervous again like I said. He sighs really loudly and like an idiot I ask what ? What‚Äôs wrong ? Then he doesn‚Äôt say anything again and just sighs irritated. Nervously I ask ‚Äúwhat ? What do you want ? He then gets in my face and says I WANT you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. (Empasizing the want) Then whispers to stop in MY EAR and goes back to kissing me even though I wasn‚Äôt and gets ontop of me again trying to kiss my neck.

  His Uncle walks in and asks if I‚Äôm okay because we‚Äôre kissing but he‚Äôs touching me groping me actually grabbing my boobs my ass and I‚Äôm literally doing nothing back but kissing him. I‚Äôm embarrassed and my face is getting red cuz I feel embarrassed about that so I say I‚Äôm okay and then he leaves and talks to his uncle‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

  Then he comes back and says ‚ÄúNow‚Ä¶.. where were we ?‚Äù And I don‚Äôt like how he says it but I feel insecure and I keep thinking maybe I should just touch him back like he wants even though it‚Äôs because he said he wanted me to stop sarcastically and even threateningly so at first I do. 

  Then he tries grinding on me again and I completely pull away and stop kissing him I stop like everything. I‚Äôm just looking down at what he tried to do again and I‚Äôm in shock. I wanted to say something but the way he said ‚Äú stop ‚Äú was so aggressive and it made me feel guilty and afraid, but again I just kept telling myself it‚Äôs fine I‚Äôm overthinking it he‚Äôs nice. 

  Then he looks down also looks at me sighs and then grabs me and kisses me I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt really think I need to scream and I‚Äôm getting afraid cuz I‚Äôm not grabbing him back, but either way he‚Äôs kissing me so aggressively not moving away from my face that I do back just because he‚Äôs freaking me out and I don‚Äôt want to offend him. So I think maybe if I don‚Äôt put my hands on him. So I don‚Äôt . The weird thing is idk maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it but he had grabbed and just kissed me before too and in his room, so why would I think the situation would get dangerous? 

  Then he just gets on my legs with his knees and I can‚Äôt move. We still have our clothes on. He just literally sits on my legs with his knees and I can‚Äôt move. I think does he realize he‚Äôs crushing my legs. I wanna scream but I just freeze. I can‚Äôt move.  I don‚Äôt care what anyone says idk how to describe it but simulating ‚Äúrough sex‚Äù except I didn‚Äôt consent so it simulated something different almost for me that seems more accurate than saying it was dry humping because that‚Äôs when two people are doing it. This was not that. To me it was just violating and abuse. I mean I couldn‚Äôt move I didn‚Äôt move once. 

  At all. 

    Then he proceeds to aggressively hump me until he finishes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ all while I can not move (tonic immobility) like freezing in fear cuz of him getting on my legs and I dissacociated‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but it was HOW he did it he seemed mad at me and he was aggressive. And it was kind of roughly‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. how he did it though thankfully wasn‚Äôt injured not to that point. He made me feel his groin area‚Ä¶.. many times‚Ä¶. Through the clothing. He forced my body to react then just finished‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. But after a long ass time n mind you I was HELD DOWN during this. He even TOOK BREAKS. And he kept getting ontop of me while he did this. It was terrifying I tried like if I just look away never look at him maybe he‚Äôll stop. He didn‚Äôt.  Even though it was aggressive dry humping I mean I was dissacociated and I froze and it sounded wrong so to be completely honest to ME from MY perspective at first I thought ‚Äú oh god it sounds like I‚Äôm being raped‚Äù and it did because he was roughly doing it without my consent and it didn‚Äôt sound right. It literally sounded forced, but my mind just went somewhere else though I partly had awareness of what was going on. And it took time to even figure out what was going on because I had never done anything at all sexually, so I was really scared. Emotionally though I just felt dead inside: empty. I felt like a fucking toy and he was using my body to‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ you know. And I was just there frozen unable to move. :( 

  I know he didn‚Äôt rape me or anything n I‚Äôm grateful it was at least over our clothes but here‚Äôs the thing : I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING I HAD NO SEXUAL EXPERIENCE  and I‚ÄôM A VIRGIN so to me it was horrifyingly close to something else or am I being dramatic ? I know it‚Äôs not even actual sex. I‚Äôm traumatized though. It still gave me PTSD.  And some fucking weird kinks and affected my sexuality amongst other issues‚Ä¶.. .-.

  I should mention honestly I wasn‚Äôt ready at all. I could see myself having been ready like 20‚Äôs like early 20‚Äôs . I was 19 at the time. It really hurts this being my first experience. Plus it makes dating just a nightmare. Especially being a bit promiscuous after this for a while just to make myself feel better like the more experienced I am, the less this matters. That isn‚Äôt helping though so now I just probably need therapy first before I do anything related cuz it just reminds me of my assault‚Ä¶..",ptsd

  So I started lying to myself I told myself he‚Äôs being rough and that‚Äôs hot I‚Äôve decided not humiliating not disturbing and so I focused on that . And then that didn‚Äôt help because then I felt like a slut.

"tw: molested by cousin growing up Hi I just wanted advice as I have no one to talk about this with. I‚Äôm 24(M) I have OCD and assume I have some PTSD. When I was maybe between 6-8, I remember my older cousin doing sexual things with me and my other cousin who was a year younger than me. She is 6 years older than me so a teenager at the time and she would dry hump with us when we were alone. I always was aware of this happening(I might‚Äôve forgot years after it happened) and I sort of just ignored it or maybe tried to cope with it by thinkin it was just a really weird thing that happened but I guess I‚Äôm my head somewhat consensual. This was my earliest memory of knowing what sex was. This ended up with me growing up with a rather bad relationship with sex not to mention I‚Äôve had OCD since a child and only recently found out. Sexual OCD is probably the hardest ocd type for me to deal with. I just don‚Äôt know what to feel. I actually got close with her as an adult but I just feel super weird now bein a lot more conscious about this. My biggest struggle in life is OCD so most of my trauma feels tied to that but I never really considered how much of an impact this had on me cuz I just didn‚Äôt want to think abt it. I think another bad part abt this is the fact that me and my cousin who i mentioned before did actually end up doin inappropriate things wit each other and actually got caught kissing once, the most awful part I hate is the fact that after this there was a time with my other younger cousin where I pulled their pants down and told my uncle and I got screamed at of course rightfully so, pulling their pants down was all that happened and I always get scared thinkin abt what if things would‚Äôve gone further. It‚Äôs so gross and I‚Äôve honestly lived with so much guilt from this. Im positive my family doesn‚Äôt even know that my older cousin was the one that introduced these behaviors to me and my younger cousin. Just feel uneasy abt this don‚Äôt even feel super scared cuz I worked thru so much of my anxiety living with OCD but I just feel super queasy and numb right now.",ptsd
"I was 5 years old when I made my first drug deal.  My parents were fucking crazy. My mom used to put weed or meth in a cigarette carton, then would send me as her little messenger (even in snow storms) to these 2 scary people in my neighborhood. 

Her best friend was a drug dealer. His daughter was my age, and they forced us to be friends from kindergarten on. My mom never listened to me and made me go with him for carpooling. I would get sick and puke in his car because the smell was so bad and I would be so scared that it came out physically. At their house, it was in middle of no where in the woods, so big, an intercom and cameras everywhere, he apparently worked at a tile business but was NEVER at work, he always had robberies, family members would randomly die, scary people would show up at their house coming and going all day, he would drive us to random towns for meals to meet people. He was arrested by the time we were seniors in high school. He wrote my mom, and he was released right before I went NC. She picked me up at train station, and started taking me to his house. She was laughing as I cried and begged not to take me near him. 

Then that last xmas with my mom, my 3 brothers ditched me and went to our other side of the family party so I was stuck with her. She drove me to an abandoned apartment complex, took me in an abandoned apartment trap house with 2 creepy guys, and started snorting stuff in front of me while they asked if I wanted any. WHAT. 

I just dont get why these people would put me in harms way so much. Even my grandfather was a creep, like would put his arm around my moms waist and stuff and touch her. A classic narc, very wealthy and powerful. He used to tickle my 3 brothers, and they HATED IT. They would beg my dad not to let my grandfather do that to them, but my dad was too intimidated by him to protect my brothers.

So, the last time I saw my mom she dropped me off at train station. 7 min away. She told my brothers laughing, and told me to scare me that shes taking me 1 hour away to a dangerous area of the city to figure it out with the ""bad guys."" Just to see me scared. Its sick. They are sadistic fucks.

And they still act like victims as to why i went NC lol",ptsd

I was diagnosed with ptsd when I was 14, I am now 21 and I sometimes question whether I have ptsd or not. My partner says he can see how it affects me, but I don't. I also like, dissociate constantly tho. I always tell myself things weren't that bad how could I possibly have ptsd? From repeated SA, to surviving shootings, to being forced to smoke meth at 10 with my dad, watching my mom overdose while i try to feed her tomato soup bc i didnt understand she was dead, to being beat, to being homeless and abandoned at 11 y/o, to being neglected so bad my siblings and I had to eat the lice from each other's hair to survive. I just feel numb? I don't cry about it, I don't think about it. I guess I just shove it all away, and drink myself to death. Is that  normal? Am I actually not as traumatized as I think I am? I feel fine ig? Can someone go through all that and like, not have ptsd? ",ptsd

"I have certain trauma with orthodontic fittings. In middle school, a band of cronies restrained me. The leader fixed my palate guard too tightly. He struck me, making that guard shatter the roof of my mouth. Matter dripped out of the resulting hole. I spat some out. He wanted control over me in that he could hold my mouth's inside to dull my intelligence whenever he wished. He relished in having that kind of control over me. He told me to not look in a mirror. I was too damn scared to disobey. I had become used to obeying people out of fear.

Later on, an art teacher made me put a palate guard on. He fixed it on too tight. He concussed me by hitting me with a chair. I was broken. I lost consciousness a few days later. I was carted to the ER. I wasn't the same afterwards, or so I had been told. The aunt tried to prevent surgery. I had a plate installed unbeknownst to me. I forgot what had happened. I was too afraid to even broach the subject before. I was afraid to tell the principal that I wanted him fired. I was afraid he would come back for revenge, to finish the job. That art teacher was overly eager to beat up a fourteen-year-old. He was overly eager to damage him.

We laughed (which is a big deal when in recovery) and had pretty good conversation for about an hour. When I came home, I was absolutely exhausted and could barely peel myself off the couch for hours. 

This isn't a once off. It happens every time I'm social and it doesn't seem to matter who I'm with or if it was enjoyable or not.

I immediately contacted a counselor the next day after the gun incident to set appointments up. The relationship was over and needed to be. I thought talking to a counselor would help. It has but not for what I think is PTSD. My counselor also thinks it is. Should I ask my counselor to refer me to a specialist in the PTSD field? Or is this ""just trauma""? The woman I was with definitely had a lot more trauma, horrible trauma in her past. She may have PTSD but thinks she is fine not relevant, just a side note

I started walking, I have completely lost interest in myself, I was doing so good on a weight loss program until about a week ago. I started this in July before the two main incidents. There has what I have termed ""branches"" to my condition as well. Other incidents that may have been building a ""foundation""

My main symptoms are these: #1 I can't be around other couples fighting or arguing, it triggers me and even if a hint a disagreement is coming, I immediately leave 2. A weird brain fog that happens 5-6x a day at work when I'm in front of a patient and I sit there for a min almost frozen. 3. I lose my train of thought quickly now. 4.

I ended up needing emergency surgery and got taken to the hospital in an ambulance. 

Ever since I've been having nightmares and constant fear of anything medical. Ambulances, hospitals, doctors. It all makes me incredibly panic and anxious.

Got diagnosed with generalized anxiety, started on sertaline. Best my local doctor could do, she isn't allowed to diagnose any other illness, and it's a multi year wait for a psychiatrist here.

But I'm still struggling hard, especially since tons of surgical complications lead to another surgery last month, so its like it's fresh in my mind still.

"will I ever be me again Hey so I got out of this relationship with this guy about a year ago. He was incredibly mean to me, especially towards the end. In the beginning it was just small comments. And I trusted him so I let it go. And then they got bigger and he got meaner. Eventually I was convinced nobody would ever want me so I stayed. Once we ended, he was so mean and just tore me apart. Paragraphs about how I was ugly, nobody would ever love me, he never loved me, ect. It got so bad that my parents were going to put a restraining order on him.

It‚Äôs been about a year and a half and im still not the same. I am trying to get myself back but it feels kind of impossible.

I miss not feeling like a nuisance to everyone around me, I miss being able to talk things out with people without fear of them being mad, I miss liking myself and how I looked. I am so tired of this ruining my relationships with friends and potential relationships with guys as well. (Just fucked up a talking stage with this guy I REALLY liked because I was scared to talk things out). I miss the passion that I used to have for things. I used to be so passionate about my writing and crocheting and my style and the people around me and now im just kind of here. I was so so special. Just a ray of sunshine and laughter and I made everyone around me feel so happy and special.

And now im such a shell of myself. I still like crocheting and dressing up and everything but i am not as passionate about it. I am no longer kind. I am so mean to people for no reason. I am in therapy, on medication, I go for walks, I journal, but it feels like I‚Äôll just never be me again. I have goals. I work towards them and I am trying to better myself because yes, he did fuck me up but it‚Äôs my choice to either stay that way or get better. And I know I can get out of my depression but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be ME again. 

Im not mad at him anymore. It‚Äôs not productive. And i understand him. I understand why he does those things. I understand why he‚Äôs so mean. I just wish I got away sooner. I wish this wasn‚Äôt my first relationship. 

Everyone keeps telling me to forget and move on but I just can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt move on when I deal with the effects of this every day of my life.

And the worst part is that people don‚Äôt believe me. He gets away with it. He‚Äôs on the news for some bullshit he pretends to care about and everyone‚Äôs like ‚Äúomg he‚Äôs so brave for speaking up‚Äù and in reality he‚Äôs just pretending he cares about people. 2 of my friends still talk to him.

"I was assaulted by another woman and now I don‚Äôt know what to do I was sexually assaulted by a woman a few weeks ago.

We had casually hooked up a few times, not really knowing each other in a sober context, mostly just meeting up at college parties and making out, etc. One day she encouraged me to get high and then asked to go back to my room place. When we did she raped me.

I was so high that I barely knew what was happening. I had initially consented to kissing and above the waist stuff. But she quickly grew more aggressive and it progressed to more- both her touching me between the legs and using my hand to pleasure herself. I‚Äôve been sexually assaulted before (by a man) so I just froze, I couldn‚Äôt move. When I finally came to my senses I tried to push her off of me and told her that I needed a break/to text my roommate/find my phone. I kept repeating myself but she refused to stop. 

I finally pushed myself up and tried to get out from under her, but she pinned her legs around me and forced me back down. I told her no, but she didn‚Äôt listen and kept going. The next day my arm was sprained from being held down with it pinned behind my back. I also had visible hickeys on my neck, which made it even more triggering.

When I finally got her out of my room after physically forcing her off of me (she kept saying ten more minutes and continuing to make out with and touch me despite my protests. I had eventually just surrendered and lay passively while she did what she wanted) I felt nothing.

I washed my face and immediately went to bed, feeling uncomfortable, used, and terrified. I didn‚Äôt know what had happened, or if that was normal for sex. I‚Äôve never had sex with a woman before so I didn‚Äôt know.

The worst part is I continued to see this girl for over a month before finally cutting things off yesterday. After this incident I‚Äôd still go out with her, even though she regularly ghosted me on planned dates, blew me off, and objectified me in front of other people, treating me like arm candy and talking about me in overly sexual ways in front of people I barely knew. She also always found ways to turn our planned sober ‚Äúdates‚Äù into affairs where both of us were drunk and/or high, and when this happened she was always aggressively physical with me (even though I had said I‚Äôm uncomfortable with PDA) in public spaces, pinning me up against walls/tables and making out with me roughly. 

My friends noticed this and were always uncomfortable by it, and said they were worried for my safety. I brushed it off and made excuses, and kept seeing her.

The day after the assault my roommate made a joke about my hickey, saying something about how it looked like I‚Äôd had a fun night. I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I didn‚Äôt know what I was supposed to do, or what had even happened.

I still feel like it was my fault. I put myself in that situation, saw the red flags and kept telling myself it was okay. Every time she did something cruel or inappropriate she would say I deserved better and apologized. I always told her it was okay, and I put up with all of it.

Finally I cut it off, after she told me she didn‚Äôt have the time to commit to our relationship and wasn‚Äôt going to be available much. I called it quits and told her we were done. She almost cried, for some reason, even though she had practically initiated the split. Mind you, we were never officially ‚Äútogether‚Äù, just seeing each other for around two months. 

I‚Äôm just now processing the assault after we‚Äôve broken up. I‚Äôd rewritten in my head to be just a bad sexual experience. I‚Äôve even lied about it to my friends about it being enjoyable, just rough. I‚Äôm having a really rough time coming to terms with it, and I think I‚Äôm finally feeling the effects of the trauma in full force.

If anyone else has had experience with female on female assault, please let me know any advice you have. I don‚Äôt know if I can continue to even say I‚Äôm a lesbian, as the word leaves a bad taste in mouth now. I don‚Äôt know how I can continue to date women. Anything having to do with sex just feels raw and wrong and violating. I don‚Äôt understand how people can enjoy it. I walked away from my first sexual encounter wondering if I was actually asexual because of how horrific it had been. I feel like a fraud even calling myself a lesbian anymore. I don‚Äôt know what I am.

It‚Äôs my choice to stay in this relationship so please if you‚Äôre going to judge, at least add practical advice and be nice.

trigger warning: mentions of childhood rape.

My boyfriend has a porn addiction and we addressed like three times that it‚Äôs cheating but he kept hiding and lying over and over. Then he said it gave him more pleasure than me and that they were better. He said he takes it all back and didn‚Äôt mean any of it and won‚Äôt do it again. 

That really messed with me, this happened maybe a month or so ago and I have been just as repulsed from sex, masturbation and ANYTHING inherently sexual. it makes me feel sick to think about. My boyfriend said it‚Äôs okay and to take my time and that he‚Äôs willing to do anything he can to help. I am trusting that he‚Äôs genuinely putting in effort to stop this addiction and I appreciate it of course, but my body and mind can‚Äôt let go of what he did and said I guess.?

I think it‚Äôs also hard, since I‚Äôm feeling repulsed from it, it makes me think of more bad things that have happened in my life having to do with sex.

the two main bad things I think of on top of what my boyfriend did are:

1. being raped as a child repeatedly by my stepdad

2. my boyfriend being too friendly with his female friends, watching fifty shades of gray alone with them, letting his female friends show him her dildo, etc.

It feels sickening that I let all this happen. It feels like there‚Äôs something wrong with me. my boyfriend hasn‚Äôt done anything with his lady friends in a while because he currently has none and doesn‚Äôt want to pursue a friendship with ladies. he likes his male friends and it also makes me more comfortable him having just male friends so it really does work out.

I just felt the need to explain all of this and put it all out on the table so somebody can give any advice or any kind words. I know I need a therapist but if there‚Äôs anything else I can do currently, I would appreciate the advice.

"Still feel bothered after blocking someone who use to abuse me in high school #

# 

I was bullied pretty badly in high school and faced racism. Anything from being addressed as the n word to being picked up and slammed to the ground while a friend of the main bully recorded me.

I‚Äôve gotten a black eye from him even and nearly went blind. He faced no consequences as he was a master manipulator and people like him for being the high school ""Jock‚Äù.

He always said sorry then repeated the behaviour and laughed with his buddies about it. He even made fun of my heritage (where my parents are from in Africa).

I get an apology about two years after high school and it (in my opinion) looked like an apology for himself. Sure, he said he‚Äôs sorry (he‚Äôs said it so many times it doesn‚Äôt hold value) and was more focused on saying in his apology ""I understand you probably hate my guts"".

I accepted the apology because my dad told me to.

Since then, I‚Äôve been through addiction & other not-so-proud stuff I‚Äôm not interested in sharing here. I decided to message him after all these years (been about 10 now) and it was a friendly message. Leaning towards me calling him a lovely person and how I understand if he still feels bad for what he did to me and said I understand the message could go unseen but I just wanted to share.

He, yet again, said he feels bad about how he treated me and said I look like I‚Äôm doing well and he‚Äôs happy specifically for that.

I just asked him why he called me the n word all the time and would beat me up over it. I asked if he found racism funny at the time. He denied absolutely everything he did. I then sent him screenshots of how he use to speak to me and he said ""Man, I don‚Äôt remember saying that, clearly I did though, there‚Äôs no denying that photo. I honestly don‚Äôt remember using that word with you or others. No one deserves that"".

For the sake of convenience of this post I‚Äôll make it short. We went back and forth over it and he accused me of spreading rumours about him over the last two years that he r\*\*\*d his ex and said how I can‚Äôt deny that as he has these messages pinned to my IP address.

I blocked him and unblocked him after an hour saying how crazy that sounds and specifically said the last time we spoke was in 2018/19 when he messaged me out of the blue. I then tell him if he has all that info, what does he plan on doing with it? And said intimidation and what he claims to be true do constitute grounds for legal action and said we can take this to court.

He says ""James, for the hundredth time, I‚Äôm done with these conversations. Chao for now"".

I said ""for the record, I hope those things are not true Chris, I just can‚Äôt connect the dots on why you think it‚Äôs me who did that. Chao"".

"Being friends with the person who traumatized you Hey folks. Warning for potential violence and potential murder, it's not quite abuse so I'm not adding that tag. 

The experiences that gave me PTSD were caused by one of my best friends who had PTSD themself, we lived together and due to certain circumstances I will not be discussing here, they were being triggered near-constantly. Their flashbacks were so bad that they would regularly forget who I was and would respond to certain situations violently, or sometimes they would get quiet and I would learn later that they were struggling not to attack me. I lived with them for about a month, and throughout that time I was never hurt, mostly through luck, coincidence, and a locked door.

That being said, it's been two years since I left. Unkind words were given on their part, I think because I was a constant in their life up until that point. But a few months ago, they reached out to me because of a personal situation that I could've had a stake in (I didn't) and we wound up talking about everything that happened. They were generally apologetic, and somehow we wound up saying that we would give friendship another try. 

We mostly just play games together once a week, and discuss those games. We've strayed into serious conversations a few times, but I've put my foot down once or twice when we got too personal because we aren't close like that anymore. The thing is, though, I've been wondering lately whether talking again is even healthy?

It's complicated for me, because they used to be the person I looked up to the most, my best friend, the person I told everything to. Now I don't even tell them what I do for work and whether or not I'm in school. We just dance around everything that happened like it was an awkward moment for both of us. I enjoy talking to this person, I really do, but I don't know if it's going to hinder my recovery or not. My flashbacks were less frequent at first, and then they went back to their pre-reconciliation levels. They're not as upsetting anymore, but the distress has been replaced with confusion and frustration. My mood has also been more stable (I'm also bipolar). 

I don't think that they handled the situation well, really, but I also think that it's been two years and they know better now. Not perfectly well, but better. And I'm not going to ever see them in person again, I don't think, so they're never going to be in a position again where they could reasonably hurt me.

So, my question is, can this be healthy, considering all of the checks I've put on the relationship? Everyone around me is telling me that I'm making a mistake, but I care a lot about this person. A lot. They got me through some tough times, and I got them through some as well. I just don't know anymore. In any manner, thank you for reading. It means a lot.

"I feel alone with my trauma and struggles  I've started university last month. I have been working towards this for so long. It's all I ever dreamt about. Yet... Stuff keeps triggering me. Just yesterday something did and I straight up bawled my eyes out during MULTIPLE lectures and cried for the better part of six hours. And I've felt like shit ever since. I'm struggling. And to realize everyone of my peers is just living a normal life... Most of them went to school while I went through hell. School is not a lifetime away to them. I feel alienated by my trauma. Plus I've worked so hard to be here. I can't fail. I just can't. But an awful mix of depression with frequent flashbacks are kicking my ass. And ever since my trauma occurred I've felt like I sustained brain damage. I try to think, but it's like my brain got liquified, my brain used to be filled with the chatter of my own thoughts all the time. Now I struggle to form a coherent thought and most is just emotions. I try so hard to remember all the material, but I just can't. It's like my brain is broken. And I just don't know how fix this. Why can't I just move on?

"Physically assaulted at work then my abusive ex texted me something cruel just a few hours later. I just feel so awful and lost rn  I really need some support and kindness right now and I can‚Äôt seem to explain what I need from to loved ones. I‚Äôm also feeling like I‚Äôm overreacting to what happened to me 24 hours ago. 

I‚Äôm 99.99% sure these two events are unrelated but god does it sucks. 

To cut a long story short: one of my patients (old man, but strong as hell) at work punched me in the face so hard I fell. Other than a busted lip, some aches from points of impact from fist and the floor, I am physically ok. I could‚Äôve seriously been hurt but luckily I wasn‚Äôt wearing my glasses, and I was able to fall safely 

I go home early and can only manage 4 hours of sleep. I then have to drive a family friend in my car for an hour. Which is really hard for me because I have severe trauma from being abused by my ex and grandfather inside a car. People in my car is a huge trigger. 

Right before I drive this person though, my ex texts me something weird. I‚Äôve told my ex to NEVER contact me unless it was a family emergency of some type and I thought he understood this because I hadn‚Äôt heard from him in months. Anyways. It‚Äôs a screenshot of a tweet, obviously just like some harmless little meme and I would‚Äôve excused it as maybe an accidental message not meant for me until I read what it said. 

It said ‚Äúmurmuring ‚Äòok slay‚Äô as someone shows me how to use a can opener‚Äù 

For context, 8 years ago when I was 16 and dating him (we dated for 7 years, starting when I was 16) we were making dinner at my house. I had happened to have just never used a can opener before (weird, I know, but I was 16 and I didn‚Äôt really like canned foods so I never had to use one). 

So I turn to him and I ask, ‚Äúoh hey can you show me how to use this?‚Äù But for some reason this ANGERS him. He shuts down on me, tell me to ‚Äújust look it up‚Äù (in a mean tone) and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou seriously don‚Äôt know how to use a can opener‚Äù and all around, it was just a cruel experience. He never did show me and he ended up ignoring me from how angry and stupid he thought I was 

Anyways. That was not an ‚Äúok slay‚Äù moment for me. I just have. No. Idea. WHY. He would send me a joke like that? I‚Äôm so confused? 

Like I‚Äôm just so hurt right now. And I might‚Äôve brushed it off but like. I was violently attacked not even 12 hours prior to him texting me that out of the blue. 

And I‚Äôm just feeling so down on myself. I feel like I‚Äôm overreacting to everything that‚Äôs happened in the past 24 hours. Like I‚Äôm just being over dramatic and I should get over this but god it is so hard right now. My feelings hurt. My face hurts. I just want support and kind words right now and I feel like such crap for trying to ask my loved ones ‚Äúhey can you be extra nice to me right now? I was assaulted and then my ex texted me‚Äù. 

I already told them all these details and like, they were pretty nice to me but idk it didn‚Äôt feel like enough? I don‚Äôt want to sound like a weird bitch by specifically asking them to be extra comforting to me. Or maybe they just don‚Äôt really know what else to say to me. But I feel awful for venting and feel awful for feeling like I want to be a little, idk, doted on? Is that so wrong? I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs wrong of me to feel or not.

"Confronting your abuser - does it ever help? As I heal from a lifetime of trauma, I‚Äôve been setting better boundaries, but this year had an instance where I really let myself down and didn‚Äôt enforce them. And now I have to see this person who treated me horribly several times a week. I have become fixated on confronting them, I fantasize about it all the time even on days I don‚Äôt have to see them. 

In the past, even with this person, I followed the typical advice to use it as a learning experience and move on, ignore them and focus on me. It worked the first time, but now I am just full of rage all the time and can‚Äôt seem to let it go. Yes I have tried journaling etc. nothing helps. 

So I‚Äôm wondering, has anyone ever confronted someone who has hurt them and did it help you? I don‚Äôt expect any kind of reaction or response, I just feel like I need to stand up for myself and tell this person that what they did is NOT okay. I really feel like I will be stuck emotionally until I do that but I also worry that it‚Äôs a mistake and will only make things worse.

"Just got a completely random PTSD diagnosis, don't really know what happens next.  Hi, I've never been here before, but I suppose it's the proper place on the internet to post. Posting on alt account for privacy. \*\*This became a little long, I'm sorry\*\*

I've went through a pretty extensive psychological examination the last few months, with the initial goal just to go through ADHD, but we've went through a ton. I never thought I had PTSD or something like that, I never experienced flashbacks, any super triggering moments that that made me angry or something else, never happened. I'm also like the least agressive teddy bear there exists I think.

Never really crossed my mind. But I did relate to a lot of things on the, whatever the English word, the tests you fill in, around Trauma and PTSD. But afterwards it sort of felt like an insult to people with ""actual PTSD"", that I had any thoughts surrounding that.

We had gone over things like my SA as a boy, abusive households, suicidality, amongst some other things that felt like they might be relevant in evaluating my mental health. The psychologist I talked to was absolutely amazing.

I told him about one thing that I didn't have an answer to, where most of my ""inner self"", I feel I am relatively aware of, but this was one thing I didn't understand, and never had.

I've had a ""bad feeling"", as I've started to call it, in giving up for searching for words like ""anxiety"", or whatever this ""bad feeling"", could be, since I've been around 11/12, I'm 25 now. This feeling is constant, I'm having it writing this, and everything I do, since then, aside from when I'm using drugs like benzos, or had in the past. Zopiclone managed to do that for me too somehow.

It was the only time, quite literally ever, where I felt at peace, I could relax, enjoy a  movie, or have a meal. Alcohol abuse was a thing too, but was far far less effective for the ""bad feeling"". It worked decently well for social anxiety though.

It felt far fetched that I had something like anxiety (literally) 24/7, regardless of situation. Whether I'm in love with a girl I'm dating with all the positive hormones through the roof, or going through something tough, the feeling always, always remains.

I've heard of anxiety to describe ""moments"", of anxiety, that it wasn't constant. Still don't know if it is anxiety. It's not like I think of something and it gives me this ""bad feeling"", it just always is there, where ever I go, it follows.

Paranoia, and feeling like everything is going to go to hell, regardless of what it is, or how trivial.

I seem to be physically unable to sleep like a normal human being, unless I'm on large dosages of medication. First time I ever slept since I was a child, like actually slept, was just an encounter with good, heavy sleep meds, which was relatively recent. Zopiclone only worked for a high. So I'm not on extreme insomnia at the very moment. Used to have constant nightmares, not as much anymore, but they come, and it's often repeated nightmares.

Terrible confidence in every aspect. The outside can tell me that I'm attractive or that I'm smart, it all goes away though. Everyone has an ulterior motive in my mind, they must not mean it. I'm in this weird zone where I both need validation for those types of things, and also get very little out of the validation. Feel like everyone is just out to get me, sort of thing, even when I can recognize myself that it's completely irrational. And the world is not a safe space to be in.

Super low baseline mood, never really happy, I have periods of full blown depressions once in a while. It's hard for me to find things fun or enjoyable.

I isolate myself completely, I dissociate from reality quite a bit.

I don't know, we went over a lot of my life.

I don't know how much of it is related to a PTSD diagnosis, or something else entirely, but it's there. Most of these did not exist before 11/12 y/o, but essentially all of it came after. Although some of it could just be a lot of other aspects.

My psychologist made the connection above, that my dumbass hadn't figured out, that the ""bad feeling"", amongst all else, coincidentally came after these childhood events. In a pretty focused time point. So we talked a lot about it. I asked him after all of it, what ""stood out"", he mentioned ADHD and things surrounding trauma. That these things were to persue all the way out. But PTSD, was still not on my mind. I was just like ""yeah I guess I might have a bit of a trauma issue perhaps"".

CURRENT TIMES YAY!

I go to finish an explanation of the results of a cognitive test I've made prior, and meet a different psychologist, not the dude I talked with. Turns out I get diagnosed with ADHD, and I'm not dumb (on paper) yay. Months work past me.

But, it was also, almost casually explained that I have a formal, real ass PTSD diagnosis. For whatever reason there was some miss match with a follow up for that, I suppose, and I got to hear that second-hand. And she was apologetic I remember. I look up my medical journal, and boom, a big ass, fat PTSD diagnosis up in there. She books me a time with a new psychologist for PTSD, the amazing guy is on family leave, yay.

This was a couple days ago, I'm now waiting for a follow up.

I still don't really know what the actual fuck this means. What the implications are, how this is going to impact my life, if some of these things can get better, what the treatments are, I have no clue.

So I guess after the wall of text, my question I suppose is if anyone here at all can relate to any of this, if there are people here not suffering through flashbacks or things of that nature. Maybe someone has something to share :) And also I suppose I'm writing because I can't really tell people in my surroundings about this, so this is what I've got at the moment. And I suppose I'm trying to conquer my undying shame, so saying these things ""out loud"", to people outside of just my psychologists, is news for me. Thank you. And sorry if it's too much.

"Struggling with being enraged to the state of violence after yet another man put his hands on me I've written about the details in another sub. 

I've got a pretty extensive history of DV, SA, rape, medical plus religious trauma. The list is ridiculous.

Despite that I managed over a decade of youth work, I'm ferocious about the protection of others.

I came unstuck when I asked for help for the first time in my life about 6 years ago. I wasn't helped. I was blamed, shunned, judged and revictimised and I fought back with everything I had because it's always been in my nature to do so. I have the same ferocity for myself.

I've proven that, I just find another gear and run on pure adrenaline until the danger is past and I can recover in private... till the next round.

I recently (3ish months ago) got sober after becoming unstuck from the lack of support I had 6 years ago. Obviously substances made things worse and I've taken full responsibility for the hurt I've caused other people because of that.

I'm still proccessing alot of horrific things that happened a year ago in therapy and I'm oscillating from rage to numbness constantly.

I was starting to feel some stirrings of sadness about the whole situation when a man put his hands on me completely unprovoked in a inappropriate way (not SA) at the end of last week.

Because of that it launched me into a fight type ptsd response. The kind where your so enraged you could kill someone (and I stress I wouldn't - they are thoughts).

I'm a woman and I'm feeling very unfeminine about having such violent reaction. I asked my therapist about if it's usually a male thing and they said ""usually.""

I think I'm feeling some shame about having had to become my own protector, others protector and I can't function normally anymore. I can't even hide the rage (I used to be able to hide anger)... this is different. It shows on my face and in my body language and I know it can scare some people because they don't know what's about to happen or if I'll lash out. It provokes anxiety and fear in other people and I never used to be like this. Alot more awful things happened to me in those 6 years and I'm... different again with the ptsd I have. It's like my nervous system and brain got rewired to fight mode when I was attempting to put the pieces of my life back together.

The worst thing I've done when I'm like this is break inanimate objects, throw things,, swear and slam doors. When I've calmed down enough I always apologise and mean it. I think it's because I no longer want to die so taking it all out on myself like I used to has caused the symptoms to flip into outward physical symptoms.

I'm so fucking angry with the person who has set off the last round of this inside of me. I'll let it go but I'm still recovering from the aftermath currently.

"Hallucinations  Been a while since i've posted here, unfortunately I have a hard time explaining my symptoms.
I have only been getting these hallucinations as a symptom for about a year, I thought they would get better with time but they have only been more vivid and frequent as time passes, I was hoping for advice from someone who has also dealt with this symptom and what can be done to help myself when I start seeing things.
Tonight has been the most difficult instance of this I have ever had, I came home from work and immediately thought I saw someone in my house and I tried my best to brush it off as usual, however I couldn't shake the image I had seen and was very on edge. About an hour after this my wife asked if we could change our bedroom to another room and I said yes. We started pulling out the contents of the new bedroom so we could start putting our bed and other furniture in it. The the stuff we moved out of the room was put in the hallway ( we live in a trailer and there is only
one hallway ) I came to a scary realization that if someone broke in I would not be able to quickly get to the other end of my house where I store my gun to protect my wife and I.
I then thought I saw something move at the end of the hallway on that end of the house. I immediately started panicking and felt trapped which turned into a huge episode, it took my wife almost an hour to calm me down and assure me there was no one inside other than us...
This has only seemed to get worse and not better.
I used to only see things through my window or over my shoulder as I walked inside from my car.... Now I see things like this in my house all the time.
I feel like a weak basket case that can't protect his own family.....
My final question is are these sort of vivid hallucinations common with ptsd?",ptsd

What did I do to deserve this  I‚Äôve been dealing with anxiety and depression for over a year now because of the mental abuse I deal with at home and the traumatic situations I witness and endured at home and it affects me so much to the point where I‚Äôve been having unwanted traumatic memories of past home and school trauma roam in my head for over a year now giving me significant distress and I can‚Äôt focus in school at all because of all the stress and the trauma I endured there too to the point where everybody I see triggers my traumatic memoirs even looking at my family members triggers my traumatic memories and I see them every single fucking day just constantly having these traumatic memories roam in my head makes me feel like I‚Äôm the problem and there‚Äôs something wrong with me   From school it‚Äôs incredibly bad I was dealing with a lot of the mental abuse at home and it was affecting me a lot and I thought fitting in with my peers would help me feel better about myself but it didn‚Äôt all it backfired on me badly and I‚Äôm just ashamed of the stuff I did it didn‚Äôt align with me and now it‚Äôs all coming back to me. Ninth grade was the worst for me I was dealing with a lot of home trauma witnessing a lot of things that still affects me deeply and along with the trauma at school from the kids that treated me like absolute shit I felt like I was the problem and still do and everyday with these fucking traumatic memories roaming my fucking head it makes me worse I just want to be happy  and live my life I‚Äôve been depressed for way too fucking long ,ptsd

"Is memory suppression real? Hello I (f21) am diagnosis's with PTSD, specifically in response to an abusive romantic relationship. Ever since that event I have used and abused whatever I can to separate myself from reality. During my first hospitalization a few weeks ago, while unable to distract myself, I felt like it was the first time I could think clearly in years. Unfortunately it all came to an abrupt end when my mom called me and berated me for my decision to put myself into treatment. As a result I had one of the most extreme panic attacks of my life. A few hours later (following my parents demands) I lied to the nurses, told them I was over reacting, and left. Since this happened I have confided in friends about how hurtful this out of character reaction from my mother was. They surprisingly were not shocked and instead started to bring up instances of similar behavior. Personally, I have limited or even no recollection of most of the events they mentioned. After talking to them, a few nights later I just suddenly remembered a particularly painful (and in turn shocking) memory surrounding my parents. Admittedly it feels as though I cannot trust my own memory. My parents and I have had some very rough patches but I've always felt as though they had my best interests at heart. Could these be repressed memories? I feel like I could honestly be making this all up subconsciously because of what my friends have told me and my drug use. I have been wanting to talk to my parents about my substance use and desire for treatment and this whole internal conflict is preventing from doing so. ",ptsd
"Doing the things Anyone else feel like they have tried and keep trying it all and it helps only a tiny bit here and there and you always just fall apart again?

I've done years of therapy. Read dozens of books on various aspects of my issues and the work. I have a psychiatrist and a therapist and an occupational therapist. I'm on a minimal med. Being on heavier stuff had bad side effects impacting the rest of my health which I worry would be a downward spiral.

I've scaled back my life as much as I feel I can. Too much really.

I live with fatigue and feel like the time I've done best was when I only focused on my health and thus spent almost all my energy working out. I barely manage to ever workout RN. I'm always so tired, and sore.

I had a service dog. She helped. She died last year. But also, there were stupid social issues around that which there shouldn't be but life isn't often as it should be. I've been encouraged by my Psychiatrist to get another, but it'd put my housing at risk.

"How do you know you are getting bad again?  I (F21) have suffered from depression and PTSD what feels like my whole life. The abuse took place over the majority of my childhood but wasn‚Äôt taken reported until a suicide attempt and mental breakdown leading to hospitalisation when I was 13. 
Now that I‚Äôm older I feel like I should be healed and coping. I stopped going to therapy at the start of the year as it was getting expensive and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt talk about anything serious. Since my breakdown when I was younger I have not been able to fully speak about the abuse, so my partner of 2 years and friends don‚Äôt fully know what happened.  

I feel like I go through waves where I feel like I‚Äôm doing well, I‚Äôm eating, going out, exercising, keeping up with University, not thinking of it and then (normally a flashback or extreme stress) lead me to spiralling, but I feel as if I never know until it‚Äôs too late and I‚Äôm scared.

"Instincts are confused cant trust self/others I dont know what to think/do right now, not to mention I am doing emdr around ‚Äúi cant trust others‚Äù.

I am going on month 5 of light duty on L&i. My manager said when I saw her today after giving her the new apf ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how you are on light duty when there are other people in our department with worse injuries and they are working‚Äù. I responded by reiterating that with l&i claim if further injury were to occur the company would be liable but with fmla accommodations are allowed because held to different standard. She seemed annoyed at my response and said grievance of not having someone to cover my work with another going out for surgery next week. I decided to validate her feeling stressed by saying it sounds like it is stressful to figure out the coverage and I will be available to support the staff as the cover my workload as able. 
This is the second time she has mentioned this the first time I had a trauma response and my reaction was not based in reality but the past (i will link my response below). This time nothing is being triggered but it still feels like she should not be saying this to me and that it is inappropriate. I am unsure if her intentions are ha rmful on purpose or she is just stressed and taking it out on me and harmful without knowing. Am I overreacting/thinking about this and should I just let what has been said go or should I talk to union rep? I also feel conflicted to do this as I like my manager and she has never crossed my boundaries when speaking to me outside of L&i claim.

Post when told something similar and response differed (trauma triggered):
L&i triggered ptsd at work
I just completely dissociated at work and when coworker asked if okay i broke down crying. I used a photo of a good memory to bring me to an ok place now. I am currently on l&i and my manager was surprised my light duty was extended by doctor. I realized I dont know much about l&i and so I looked into it. I saw some lawyer sites where says its legal (even for state workers) to be tracked by private investigators if they believe you can go back to work or are per my employers words ‚Äúmilking it‚Äù(this was said about a past employee on l&i claim when talking about continuing on light duty). Anyway, I have ptsd and have been stalked and the possibility of being followed triggers this. I don‚Äôt know how to go forward as I know its unlikely this is happening to me but still triggered me. I don‚Äôt know what to do as never used l&i before and feel like it is causing ptsd to worsen with fear of being followed again.

"Will I ever actually get better? I can‚Äôt remember a time in my life where things were different. I was in dangerous situations from a young age, as I grew to a teenager, I put myself in a lot other dangerous situations with my temper and lack of control, and ego. 

I‚Äôve been in a lot of altercations. I‚Äôve been attacked many times, I‚Äôve attacked people many times in retaliation. I‚Äôve been jumped, beaten, kicked and stabbed at different times in my youth. 

I‚Äôve lived a beautiful life for the last 2 and a half years or so now. I survived. Today I feel like random people who I just met are untrustworthy or trying to take something from me. I don‚Äôt let anyone walk behind me (I‚Äôve been jumped from behind), I can‚Äôt trust anyone and I‚Äôm always in a state of tension and readiness. 

My mind has cleared up a lot, I‚Äôve talked thru a lot of the flashbacks and situations where me/people I love were almost killed. I‚Äôm very hopeful for the future and I live a good life, I cleaned up, got off drugs, went to college. I‚Äôm doing great. The faces of my old enemies began to not startle me anymore when I would see them in my head. 

But I can‚Äôt just relax. I‚Äôm lying in bed rn, and the last thought I had was about an older man I met for the first time today, he literally was so nice and we had a good conversation‚Ä¶ I was thinking about this as I lay down but then my head comes out with ‚Äúif he tries to fuck me over I‚Äôm gonna kill him‚Äù. 

For context, I‚Äôm a fit 19 year old man. He was far older and smaller than me. This thought made absolutely no sense. Why do I see innocent people as a threat? It‚Äôs not like I always see them this way but I can‚Äôt get the smoke to clear when the mood takes me. 

My brain just said ‚Äúwhy would this random man be nice to you‚Äù and it immediately became defensive. I come from a place where most people are extremely friendly unless you make enemies with them. It‚Äôs like I think everyone has an agenda, things they want that they‚Äôd be willing to fuck me over for. AND I KNOW ITS NOT TRUE

I KNOW ITS NOT TRUE. 

I have been shown so many times that it is not true. It makes me feel like I truly am mentally ill, I‚Äôve never known anything different. I‚Äôve always been an upbeat guy, laughing all the time. When I was a child, before things happened, I used to only ever laugh or cry, there was nothing in between. I was always an intense kid. So maybe that doesn‚Äôt help. 

I just want so badly to come home and actually believe that the fighting is over, but I‚Äôm so UP all the time. It takes so little to set me off but the thing is I don‚Äôt even realise I‚Äôm ‚Äúset off‚Äù. It‚Äôs just normal to me. And then I realise people are afraid of me, intimidated. Cos I‚Äôm in fight mode. 

Last night I couldn‚Äôt sleep, and I was sick for the whole day, my stomach was so weak and nervy. I felt cold. My body wouldn‚Äôt stop tho. Adrenaline kicked in at around 10am, just after I rested while on public transport for a while. 

God I don‚Äôt know. I just wanna come home. 

It hurts me so much that people I love are afraid of me when they feel the intensity. They don‚Äôt realise that in that moment I‚Äôm actually a lot more scared than they are‚Ä¶ and there‚Äôs no good reason why anymore, it‚Äôs been over for years, they‚Äôre not coming anymore. 

But I‚Äôm just scared. My body is scared. ",ptsd
"Can you develop PTSD from being physically ill? Hello, hope everyone is doing well. Sorry if this is against the rules or a stupid post, I will delete it if people want me to.

So I've had a look online at some information about PTSD or CPTSD and in some regards it seems like I might fit, but in other cases I'm not sure. For example, I've never suffered abuse or anything like that, my family are great. So I thought I might share my experience and see if anyone here can offer any advice, if that's okay.

When I was 13, I suddenly got really ill. I would feel like I was gonna be sick almost constantly, no matter what I was doing but I think it might've been worse when I ate. We had a lot of tests, for celiac disease and lactose intolerance, but couldn't figure out what was going on. I dunno how much I weighed but I wasn't eating and my weight dropped. Then after 2 months in December 2013 my appendix ruptured, so it looks like it was that all along.

Not long after that I started having trouble eating, like there was a mental block, it was really difficult every time I ate so I avoided it a lot. Then I started to have OCD symptoms like having routines about everything and obsessing about the possibility of being sick. Things got worse and worse until I had to go into the psychiatric ward in 2015. I was there for 3 months, and by the time I left the eating problems and the OCD seemed to have receded.

But after I left, I realised that I no longer seemed to feel emotions or enjoyment about anything. I don't know when it happened or how or why but at some point while I was at hospital I went from crying every day to now having not cried in over 9 years. I'm just numb all the time, I don't enjoy anything or have any interests or passions or anything. The OCD and eating problems have returned but in slightly different guises, along with depression, and nothing seems to help, not therapy (CBT, TherapyForYou, counselling, group OCD therapy, art psychotherapy and currently seeing a private therapist) or medication (Sertraline, Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Vortioxetine and probably others I've forgotten) or anything. I had EMDR but the lady ended up stopping it because it wasn't doing anything. So now I'm stuck, I have no energy or drive to do anything, even the stuff people suggest like exercise or trying new things. I've read about things like the freeze response and it seems to make sense but I don't know what to do about it. 

Sorry for the long post, I didn't know what was worth mentioning and what to omit",ptsd

"Anyone have advice for how to know if memories are real? Hi, I'm sorry if this is not the place for this, but I wasn't really sure where to go with this.

Basically, I have been diagnosed with DID, but the ""root"" of that, meaning the specific trauma that caused it has always been a bit unclear. When I was 8 I lived alone with my dad for a year, and all I know from that is that it wasn't good. I went to therapy when I was 11 and already then I couldn't remember the year with my dad. 

Now, I'm doing a lot better, I'm stable and pretty mentally healthy. I think that's why the lost year has suddenly kinda ""resurfaced"". I haven't been in touch with my dad in years, but wished him happy birthday a week or so ago, and since then things have kind of been chaotic. 

I want to remember what happened. After I moved away to stay with my mom, I was broken. Suicidal, depressed, I had daily panic attacks and nightmares most nights, and I was only 10. It's just not normal, and it makes me think something might have happened to make me that way.

I know he was verbally abusive, and I was neglected pretty bad that year, but that doesn't kinda seem extreme enough for how bad I got? 

There are also these snippets that make me worried I might have been assaulted, but I was 8 and its 20 years ago now, so how do I even trust whatever fragments I get ahold of?? How do I know what is a real memory, and what is just me projecting my worst fears? 

If anyone has been through something similar I would love some advice. Unfortunately going back to therapy isn't an option right now.",ptsd

I seen her yesterday at a family party for my sister and I couldn't even look at her without feeling sick, I really hate her for that and idk if I can forgive her and she was just acting like nothing happened and tried to be ""cool"" the whole time by hanging out with older ones. obviously I didn't say anything to her cause I don't think I'd even get the words out. I just wanted to smack her across the face and tell her to never speak to me again but instead I pretended she didn't exist and I'm not letting that stupid pick me bitch near me again. I think the reason why she was with that girl was bc she was trying to be cool or something because the one I hate was dressed like a s1ut and my little cousin seems to want to be around those people idk why, but I wouldn't have even known if other girls at the party hadn't texted me to tell me that the bitch was there and they didn't know who could have invited her other than my cousin so I don't want anything to do with her anymore and she's not allowed into my house if she's gonna start hanging with psychopaths.

"Do I have to experience flashbacks everyday? I'm sorry if this sounds disrespectful. I posted a similar question on r/mentalhealth because I'm still not diagnosed with anything specific but it got me nowhere, so I decided to ask here.
I don't have any specific diagnosis and I'm not trying to self diagnose myself. My therapist did say I'm ""traumatized"", referring to an event that happened 10 months ago, but nothing else. In my free time I did some research and I found out I relate to almost all the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD (excluding nightmares): I experience them all: flashbacks, intrusive thoughts and memories... Just not every single day.
I have intrusive thoughts almost everyday and  full-on flashbacks roughly once every two weeks, but when they happen they're strong (I had to leave class once). It's like my brain is giving me mixed signals: some days it feels as if I'm perfectly fine, some days I get crushed by memories, and I don't know what to think of it.

Lately I've been getting extremely wasted and making a fool of myself in front of my friends and my girlfriend. When I start drinking it's not like I'm even thinking of what happened, I've just been subconsciously allowing myself to get smashed more.

My grades were bad and my mother didn't like that . This was for years ago and I cut contact with her year ago (on the fifth of June to be precise). But even though I physically cut contact with her she keeps haunting me in my sleep. I keep dreaming that I have to return to that hell. And I lost the ability to trust anyone. Because of that I keep pushing everyone away who remotely  care about me because there's a part of me screaming that there gonna backstab me.

Recently i've been thinking of moving to a uni in another country (theres a program for that in my uni). But i dont know if the right thing to do is simply runaway. Or should i stay here and fight against my fear of seeing him there again? (He was my classmate).

"I am finally getting my independence back!! Four years ago I survived two separate traumas with in a span of two months apart, the second was a violent trauma and both nearly killed me but the second was way worse and it's taken me years to get through.  

What happened to me isn't important but what is important is I'm starting to get my independence back!  I haven't left my house alone in four years, I haven't driven a car in four years.  Yesterday I was required to drive with others and while the trauma I survived wasn't based around cars or driving it was still something I haven't done and I was nervous! 

Today I had to drive someone to work and then drive home... alone.  Driving home by myself was the first time I was alone outside my home in four years and I did great!!  I'm actually excited to do it again and I'm starting to get back what I lost.  Physically I am significantly healthier then I was before my trauma, psychologically I've been apprehensive but I am happier then I've been most my life, just not independent until today!

"Paranoia? So my ex has aspd, now I have ptsd.  It‚Äôs been rough, we have had no contact for 9 months.  We have a child in my care.  I have flashbacks when I think he‚Äôs going to kill me, I don‚Äôt remember what happened. 
I‚Äôm doing really well at the moment.
Today I had a puncture, a screw in my back left tyre.  6 days ago I had a puncture a screw in my back left tyre.
I checked they did not put the same tyre back on by mistake.
My doorbell footage does not view this part of the car.

"Fear of being alone at night I live alone and I hate being alone at night. I have a significant other and spend the night with them 1-2 days a week but other than that I'm on my own with just my cats most nights. It was so bad that during the summer I would go to bed when it was still light out to avoid this, but since it gets dark so early now I can't do that any more. I'm not sure why. My trauma is not particularly related to the night time but something about it just scares me so, so much. When I leave my SO's house Ill sometimes end up distraught and crying at the thought of spending the night alone. Does anyone else experience this and has anything helped? Spending less nights alone is probably not an option right now, and I already have pets for company.",ptsd

I listen and give advice but I only see it through my lenses. My advices seem rational and good to me but I didn't live through what they did and could just be doing more harm than good. I am definitely pushing for therapy (although it might not be so developed in their country...)

"Career and surgery messed me up First post. I always, since I was little kid, wanted to help people especially the underdogs. I became a paramedic/ firefighter in a renowned party and crime city. The pediatric calls messed me up. I‚Äôm sure my childhood influenced that. I had an extremely painful surgery experience in April 2023 where they had to do a thoracotomy (cracked my chest bones) and scraped my lung away from my back. They also removed part of my lung. I woke up screaming in pain. I never recovered physically, mentally or emotionally. I already had PTSD but now it is focused on the medical field. I get anxious whenever I have to go to the doctor. I have 3 chronic conditions so I end up having to go to the doctor way too much. Since my surgery I have gone into respiratory distress a few times and my spouse called an ambulance. I would get terrified when I saw it and begin to cry plus I would pee myself. I am so ashamed and have begged my spouse to just let me die.

"I was raped when passed out drunk 2 years ago and I‚Äôm only getting upset about it now. Confused why I‚Äôm upset when it wasn‚Äôt personal and I have few memories of it I got seperated from my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô on a night out and went back to her hotel to try and find her. My last memory of the night was in a room with at least 4 men in and was later found by other hotel guests naked in the corridor and my stuff was dumped in the outside bins. I woke up the next morning in her room not knowing anything bad had happened until I heard her on the phone to the police. Condoms with my DNA were found inside the room. 

A part of me is angry and upset that people are like that out there, but I know of the evil in the world and have read about much worse. I feel like I‚Äôve got over this.

I‚Äôm also upset that I wasn‚Äôt more demanding of answers from police. I understand this was my brain in defence mode and believing it wasn‚Äôt true to protect myself. 

I‚Äôm angry at my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô for totally abandoning me when I was extremely drunk. She‚Äôs not in my life anymore, she was always a shit friend and I should have never trusted her. I‚Äôm grateful that I know the kind of friend I deserve now. 

I‚Äôm angry that I got black out drunk so many times before that, always told myself I wouldn‚Äôt do it again, yet it kept happening. I‚Äôm annoyed that I drank so much around someone I had never gone out drinking with before. I‚Äôm guilty that I put my real friends through nights out with me as a liability. This I‚Äôm blaming on being young and not setting myself strict enough rules around drinking. I have learnt from this and I‚Äôm glad I will be safer in future.

I also keep finding any excuse to make the men and their behaviour ok, like maybe I was compliant at first (still is rape). I‚Äôm telling myself I know nothing, anything could‚Äôve happened. It wasn‚Äôt personal.

"When you've hit rock bottom the only way to go is up First off CW for abuse, csa, hoarding, and ideation

This is my first time posting something like this on a reddit forum besides maybe some drawings on other forums. Reason why I'm here is for support and to connect with others who may have gone through similar.

Little bit of background I'm 21 and have delt with PTSD for as far back as middle school. I wasn't diagnosed until June of 2021 and have been struggling to figure out what this means for me since said diagnosis. One thing that you should know is I'm also AuDHD and have MDD for context.

To make things short, I came from a broken home, 3 siblings (C is currently 27yro, N is 24yro, I'm the 3rd born and my youngest sister Ce is 19yro as of writing) single mom who at the time I was born was divorcing my dad. My dad was abusive physically to my mom and had very untreated ADHD, his anger was out of control 99% of the time.
I was too young to witness any of it, once I was old enough to remember anything he was already kicked out and out of my life.
I was 5 when my moms new boyfriend moved in and later in life at 7-8 years old he would abuse me sexually, later found out all 4 of us kids were abused by him. He was also just a massive dickhead, who was (and I don't like using this word for this) a narcissist.
He started fights and loved to see and make my oldest sister who was severely autistic, extremely upset.
She would get so upset she would get into physical altercations with my mom almost on the daily and threaten her sisters including me that she would murder us in our sleep. We had to lock the knives away in a separate drawer.

Needless to say, little me didn't get much sleep at all as a kid. If I wasn't kept up by my sister and step dad having screaming matches, I was up awakened by panick attacks that my sister would one day come and kill us in our sleep. To this day I have insomnia because of high anxiety.

My paternal grandma was the only one who really took care of me. My mom wasn't in her right mind at the time of raising me and my grandma noticed at a young age I wasn't held as much as a mother should hold their infant. So my grandma held me many times I've had autistic meltdowns and my mom would disregard me as being difficult. My family never caught onto the fact I was AuDHD because in comparison to my high needs autistic sister, C, to them I was as neurotypical as they get. So I never got accommodations for my AuDHD.

The problem is my Grandma never really did anything to help with C's anger against my mom and step dad which would only end up in more arguments. My grandma meant a lot to me but by age 13 my mom had stopped taking us to our grandma's since she thought my grandma was only making things worse (and to an extent, she was).

Leaving the only person who ever treated me with kindness dispite my AuDHD was only further destruction to my development (hence the PTSD diagnosis).

January 11th 2019 was the day my step-dad got outted for sexually abusing all of us kids. My sister, N, came into my room crying because my oldest sister C had told her that my step dad had groped her the other night. I had to call my mom from work and all I remember was the sound of my mom wailing over the phone begging N to say she was lying.

We called the cops. They took my sisters reports. And I stayed silent. I stayed silent because being the ""trouble child"" in my family as well as undiagnosed untreated AuDHD it was easy to blame me for a lot of things and dismiss me for my feelings and concerns due to me being ""unruly"". I thought at the time they would dismiss my assault just the same as everything else I had concerns of throughout my life.

After that I knew no one was taking the grief well and neither was I. My family was just so angry at eachother blaming everyone for the fights the assaults, who deserved what more, who's fault it was, who caused it. Everyone was pointing fingers all at anyone but the man who assaulted us.
I was excluded by my sisters for being ""papa's favorite"" since to them ""I was never assaulted"". Mom detached from us kids because every one of my sisters were mad at her for bringing her boyfriend into our lives only to traumatize us. Everyone blamed eachother for grieving. Everyone blamed eachother for not listening to what the other has to say.

No one was getting anywhere.

I had known my mind was fucked up beyond imagination so I sought a counselor through my school who then refered me to a therapist office that provided my school services since my highschool was in a low income area of Seattle that had students who have been brought up in bad homes.

I started therapy sophomore year of highschool and was diagnosed with Post traumatic stress at 17.

I graduated during the pandemic, moved to Ellensburg WA to attend CWU for only 6 months before realizing I didn't have the funds to complete college. Then moved back home March of 2022

It was the hardest decision I've ever made. As I had promised myself I would never come back to my mom's house after graduating.

I got a summer job that paid well then worked as a receptionist at a clinic in Seattle in September 2022. Come October I would meet my first boyfriend...now ex.

My relationship with my bf (well call him Jackie) was a breathe of fresh air. He lived in Bellevue and we hit it off pretty well through bumble. He lived with his parents since he was attending college and working and didn't make enough to move out and wasn't in school enough classes to move into dorms.
He came from a pretty privileged background his dad a white collar worker, a boss of a boss for a tech company in Seattle. His mom, too disabled to work and had to retire early.
He had one sibling, older than him that was moved out and attending school.

Everyday was bliss. It went from getting yelled at by some patients family at work then going home to a house of family members who hated eachothers guts. I lived with my little sister in a small room and being both adults wasn't ideal at all, we would fight over space all the time. But my mom didn't have the money to move us to a larger house where we'd have our own space.

But on the weekends? The weekends....it was another world. The grass felt greener on the other side. Weekdays was long shifts and a hoarders house of spoiled milk and leftovers piled in a fridge. My mother and sisters fighting at night until I'd wake up at 4 in the morning to go back to work but the weekends....

I went to Jackie's house. Clean food, clean water, no bug infestations, no fear of spoiled food and botulism, no fear of having to buy take out and sleeping in moldy bed sheets. The weekends. They were what I needed.

His parents knew that I was living in a bad home and made it known that I could go to their home at any time to escape for a breather before going back to work and paying off student loans.

Come October last year I had to move into his parents due to my school charging me 200 more on my student loans each month. That along with paying moms rent and gas meant I was spending more money than I was making.

I got into a huge argument with my mom, I asked her if I could spend less on rent due to an increase in loan payments and she didn't take it well. I took an uber to spend the night at Jackie's. I woke up with the idea to move in. The clinic that I worked at had a unit in Bellevue. If I had gone up the ladder from Receptionist to tech I'd be making more. But I'd be paying just the rent and loans instead of my mom's gas, the groceries, utilities ect ect ect.
I talked with Jackie's parents and they let me stay, knowing I was in a bad home they set a plan for me to move in and work full time so I could pay off my debt. They said no matter what happened to Jackie and I, their house was a safe haven.

Jackie broke up with me on the 13th of October this year. 2 days after our 2nd anniversary. I'll save the details because that can be it's own post here since it relates heavily to my post traumatic.

But when we broke up, I had been kicked out by his parents. The break up wasn't over something bad that he or I did to eachother, we just realized we didn't work out since we were both dealing with stuff. Jackie was trying to deal with trauma they had gone through years ago that they didn't realize had effected them till he started to see it effect our relationship. And I the same.

We both agreed to split and go no contact. Our feelings towards eachother indifferent.

I had to move back into my moms house. And it's been hard doing that while grieving my first relationship and my first LONG TERM relationship. My little sister, Ce, has been there for me but only for a bit until it exhausts her. I get it, my house is a family who hasn't properly grieved their traumas and don't believe in therapy (unfortunately).

Getting back into this environment is hard. 

I have to walk on eggshells around my mom and sisters. The food here is spoiled and my mom keeps buying more food that only then becomes spoiled because there's no room in the fridge for it to be put in.

Talking about the trash in the house has been hush hush. I get that working with hoarders it's very important to not make note of the hoarding and instead approach it from a point of understanding their trauma. But if I actually want to help my mom then it needs to involve an actual therapist to coach the act of removing the hoard.

My sister Ce has given up on trying to help my mom since she's tried everything and came to a point ""here. You're more likely to get kicked out by mom for mentioning the kitchen than you would catch botulism from 7 day old leftovers.""

The first week moving back in after breaking up with Jackie, I was incredibly suicidal. I went back to the house I promised I wouldn't come back to. I was kicked out and into the house my exes parents promised they would not send me back to.
I didn't have Jackie to text for support whenever the house became too much for me. Never mind I'm never welcomed into his home again, be it his parents or his future apartment.

I have no one.

The only thing that's helped me is a couple of friend of mine I've reconnected with, listening to music especially Tyler, the creators new album, watching all the shows I used to watch with Jackie as well as the shows I promised him we would watch together.

Coming back to a house like this is extremely triggering. And it's hard to move out since everything is expensive and I'm still in debt so I don't have the credit score to get me a car or an apartment even if I wanted to or could afford it, I wouldn't get it with my score due to being in debt.

I don't know how I'm going to get out of this all. But I hope to post more on here to connect with people who have post traumatic as I can expect will need a support group now that I'm back in a not so great environment.

I'm trying to find hope everyday and everyday I'm finding a little bit of myself again after my break up.
I still have my job, I'm so grateful for that and my boss for transferring me to a unit that's closest to my mom's place so I don't have to lose my job.

I lost a home that accommodated my needs, a family who listened and understood me, a boyfriend who gave me the love I told myself I never deserved. I'm not about to lose my job.

There's hope. I'm not about to let all this get in the way of me getting out. Promise, I'm gon make it out.",ptsd

"How to be able to eat when dealing with trauma? I'm processing a lot of traumas at the moment following a break-up from a long-term  relationship that was very toxic in a lot of ways (on both sides btw, I'm processing harms I've done as well as harms done to me). But anyway, I am struggling so much with food and eating right now and I don't know how to manage and how to get support.

It's always been this way with trauma. As a kid, I was abused for years and my eating was so affected that doctors had to get involved. Whenever I've had traumatic events, I just cannot eat. It's like when I'm in trauma, my body is just incompatible with food. It's not a weight thing, I don't care about my weight right now. At the start, it felt like an upside that I was getting to lose some weight but I'm starting to hate how much weight I've lost in the last two months. I look sick and I feel weak all the time. 

Right now, I just cannot eat unless I'm around other people or unless I guilt myself into trying to look after myself. I hate this so much. Food makes me feel nauseated to think about and it feels wrong in my mouth. Chewing feels disgusting and I have to distract myself to get it down my throat. I'm mildly panicking at the thought of trying to eat dinner alone tonight and I'm already trying to mentally justify why it's okay to skip it.

Can anyone relate? I feel like such a freak and I tried posting on an eating disorder sub but it's not the same. I don't know how to heal this. I don't know how to feel safe eating food. Has anyone had any success managing this and can offer some advice?

Finding a job that fits  I have severe PTSD panic disorder and social anxiety. I have always been a hard worker if not the hardest worker at any job I've had. My last job I had the top stats out of almost 400 people every month. The problem is finding an environment that fits. I recently started a new job and the training class is unbearable. I cry and panic every day. These people are late loud disrespectful and have made me a target cause I ask job related questions and really try to learn my job. Friday only 3 of us were there for a good half an hour into our shift putting us even more behind. It's a small room full of grown 5 year olds. They talk to me and everyone else like catch me outside girl. I quit Friday. I just couldn't handle it anymore. I don't know what to do. I been doordashing but that doesn't pay near what I need to survive in this housing market. I had my own business doing marketing for concert venues precovid. No explanation needed there... I'm lost I don't know how to survive in this world. I just want to work hard come home and be at peace. People are so feral I just can't do it. I need job recommendations. Id really like to start my own business again so I don't have to rely on other people's behaviors to make it through the day. But I'm just so lost. If anyone can give any advice. I've just lost all hope and I am up for any guidance. I've had PTSD for 35 years. It's not a passing phase. I need a job that is sustainable. Thank you for ready. Please be kind. ,ptsd
"Angry that I'm alive Hi there. I just needed to vent somewhere about this and I haven't been able to find real support on this...

I am angry that I'm alive. Not all the time, but most of it. I have chronic pain and other medical issues on top of several mental health diagnoses and I often feel like they all tag team me to make sure I'm miserable. My baseline at most any given time is uncomfortable, which is always present in some way, even when I feel decent or am having a fun time. I hurt, inside and out.

I can't get away from the memories. The triggers are everywhere and are immensely invasion. I feel everything so intensely that it takes everything in me not to resort to SH just to feel something different and in my control. I think about ending things more than I'd ever like my family and loved ones to know. 

I think about the spiritual side to things and all the existential questions. Why am I here? Why was I born? Is there a reason to this all or are we just some ant farm experiment from a sadistic higher power? I have my own thoughts about spirituality and am pagan, but I struggle hard. I'm angry that I'm here and a lot of the things I hear for an answer as to why I'm here in this life feel intensely disgusting to me and they don't make sense. I can't accept hearing that ""I chose to incarnate here for my soul contract in this life, so I'm going through all this because I agreed to it before I was born"" and the like. That feels victim blamy and yucky. It doesn't make me feel empowered. It makes me feel condemned from the start and like I'd like to strangle my spirit self for this, therefore I can't accept this being the way things are. This isn't up for debate here, I'm just mentioning this because it's where I'm coming from. I don't want a bunch of religious stuff debated or thrown at me. That's not why I'm here writing this.

I just want to know how to cope with being in so much pain that existing hurts, living is a chore, and in turn, I'm pissed off that I'm here. This includes being angry about being thrust into living in a society that seems not to like people like me. I love my parents and all, but ffs... I'm so tired. ",ptsd
"Is there any end to it? In my mid 30's. Been actively trying to get help since 23. Married 4 years now and my wife is talking of leaving she cant handle it. She's already left a few times on the condition I will change. I do my best to treat her the best I can but it's not good enough.

I am emotionally dulled I think. I have anxiety, depression, and flashbacks that interfere with my daily life such as work.

Age 2-18 abused daily by parental units and some siblings (physical, mental, emotional, and spiritually). In my late teens started abusing myself (cutting), and then drugs and alcohol heavily until 26. Have been in recovery for drugs and alcohol almost 2 years now, and have seen countless therapists over the past 10 years. Working on seeing a new one that can do emdr.

Everytime she threatens to leave (she does this by not coming home from work and staying at a friends house a couple days to a week to think things over) it sets my triggers off like you wouldn't believe, feelings of worthlessness, abandonment, and fear i will lose my best friend if i can't change fast enough. This triggers even more flashbacks and makes sleeping or work even harder. I just discovered 2 years ago I REALLY need stability in my life and these events really throw everything off balance.

I want to get better and have made some great progress the past couple years but it often seems like theres no end to it.

TL;DR tell me there's some hope, I need some happy success stories with ""becoming a real person"" despite having ptsd.",ptsd

"Abused growing up and mid life all at night , now get panic attacks  Hi, growing up I was abused and watched my father abuse my mother, for about 14 years.

"help. advice needed, toxic people in my life who ive had to stand up to are trying to silence me by messaging my rapist  *i am a FTM and my rapist/ the one i was dating at the time was a MTF* 

5 years ago i was dating this girl (MTF)  who raped me, its a long story but essentially we where both on sex enhancing drugs (meth) weve been dating for a few months at this point and the sex was fine and going well until it wasn't, i was laying down when she began to penetrate me with her fingers and it began to hurt and i told her to slow down it hurt, she then went faster and said ""not it doesnt' then commented on how 'tight' i was and how i just needed loosening up. she kept going, i kept saying no stop and she kept ignoring me, it hurt more as she went, i dissociated the rest of the it and she kept going until i finished and i felt horrific, i felt dirty and assaulted which i was, i broke up with her. then confided in someone i considered a friend at the time who was also friends with her, after telling her what happened my friend let me know what had happened was sexual assault and when i was ready i should report it, i never ended up getting around doing that as 'the friend' told her instantly what i had said and they where quick to get to together and talk about what happened ( i was not present at this get together) i was then confronted in the days following by other friends who i had not told about this saying that 'she' had told them that i had instead raped her and i need to stop lying and upsetting her with this. i, a man. had to tell a bunch of other men in the room who had no business knowing what was supposed to be between one other person what had happened to me in detail to be believed. there was heaps of shit and lies they created together just to try and silence me, another friend at the time who i tried to tell wasnt interested in hearing it and when someone brought me over to let them know i was raped they turned around and said ""fuck off get out i cant hear this right now"" i was angry at my mates and cut all of them out of my life, they couldn't be the mates i needed at the lowest point of my life and thought it was a joke and used it as a excuse to start drama, now me and that same close friend as made up in that time, and 5 years later we had a fight recently where i brought his response to me being sexually assaulted was proof to me that he doesn't give a fuck about anyone except himself, he then took that as a reason to message my rapist (her) and start the drama up again saying that i am starting all this shit when i didn't even mention her, i told my friend his response to me getting hurt was fucking shit and now im getting messages from all sorts of people from that time harrassing me saying im a bitch and whinger and stop talking about it, others saying shes going to go to the police and drag me through the court process to prove im a liar and as of right now, i have no one that believes me and its traumatizing me all over again and pushing me to crisis and people like my close friend think that its funny. this all happened after i started standing up for myself against toxic people in my life. lol.

"How to deal with somatics? Hey, I'll admit that that I wasn't diagnosed with PTSD, but from the looks of it, it is suspected. Still, the question is how would one deal with somatics? I did deal with acid reflux with the doctors help, however I keep having trouble with headaches. I can tolerate the constant feeling as if I have the flu, but the headaches are really intense as if I have a massive hangover.

"I have recently gone through a very stressful situation involving gun violence and need help/advice/someone that has gone through similar situation to talk about it with me. Flashbacks don't stop, I can't stop thinking about it, and can't find any logical reason for this event to have happened to me Very recently while riding my motorcycle on my way home, using the same route I've been using almost daily for over 2 years, I had an unhappy encounter with a reckless person with no self control at all. It started at an avenue, traffic was stopped, I was filtering since I was on a motorcycle, and suddenly another person on a motorcycle pops out of nowhere and tries to squeeze between me and a car, but failed because there was not enough space, so I went in front, and noticing the way he was riding, I decided to move quickly to get some distance from him, but he was following me. I was starting to go dangerously fast but I was pretty chill at the moment moving between traffic just enjoying the moment and he was trying hard to keep up, so I weaved my hand to the side for him to pass me or at least try to, but he couldn't. That made him so upset I could never ever imagine how a simple joke or something supposed to be a funny moment could startle someone like that. Moments later, when traffic was less dense, I reduced my speed, not much worried about him, but he caught up and didn't pass me, but rather started kicking my bike to try to make me lose balance and fall. I was like ""what the hell man?"" but I didn't say anything. Then I stopped and he stopped next to me looking very angry, and he suddenly starts reaching for a gun. He pulled a gun on me in the middle of the traffic, and I was just looking at him not understanding his reaction, I just said ""calm down man, I'm sorry if I did anything that bothered you"" Something along those lines (I can't remember perfectly as it was super quick and stressful). He pointed the gun at me and even hit me (it left a bruise on the side of my chest where he hit me) to intimidate. Meanwhile I was trying to not escalate things at all, because at that point I knew I was dealing with a crazy person and even the slightest form of confrontation could lead to me getting shot. I didn't complain about anything, and acted like it wasn't a big deal, just telling him stuff like ""sorry, my bad"" (although I knew I didn't have to be sorry for anything). He was probably expecting a fight or some sort of panic reaction from me, but since things didn't go like that he couldn't say anything, he only stared at me for some more seconds and told me to leave quickly. I left then and told the police everything. ",ptsd

"Trauma(?) dreams I don‚Äôt understand I have a lot of weird dreams connected to my father (who I haven‚Äôt seen since I was 13). The worst part is that I know they‚Äôre not real but they‚Äôre disturbingly vivid. I don‚Äôt know what to think of it.

My dreams are usually about being raped at his house, the one he was in when my parents divorced. Whether by him, by a friend of his, or by his girlfriend, it‚Äôs always got something to do with him. One time he was the one abusing me. One time he found me in the aftermath and blamed me for it. One time it was his girlfriend. Nothing about these dreams is consistent except sexual violence and him being there. 

I also remember being terrified of undressing in his house. I didn‚Äôt feel safe. Getting ready for school was a nightmare and bathing made me sick to my stomach. I don‚Äôt know what I was so afraid of but I would have anxiety attacks about it. There are a few odd memories that stand out too. He once spanked me, pants and underwear down, as punishment for something when I was little. Another time I was undressed for a bath crying because I was so upset while he was watching me to make sure I actually bathed. He never abused me though.

"Does anyone else feel weird about setting boundaries?  
So, bit of a weird one. Mention of physical attack and mention of previous abuse but nothing too graphic

I have been particularly triggered recently, panic attacks/flashbacks related to csa/sa etc. I was attacked at work by a patient who grabbed my neck, penned me in and then tried to punch me which started these up worse than normal. 

I was relaxing at a friends house and she noticed how toned my legs had become and touch them to feel the muscle. All in good fun between close friends who are basically sisters ya know. I asked her to stop which she did imediately and apologised for making me feel uncomfortable. 

I then felt bad for setting the boundary and apologised to her for being weird about something innocious and something we are used to doing. She said i don't have to explain anything, i set a boundary and thats perfectly okay, i have body automony etc Everything was fine but i was worrying that id hurt her feelings. She it not someone who makes me feel bad/guilty about things but i felt bad, i dunno if its because we are used to people not listening to us or because im triggered (hate this word but its appropiate) at the moment. I can't have people touch me even in a friendly way at the moment even for hugs if i've not initiated it myself and usually i've been  fine. 

Anyway the details aren't really the issue its just more why do we feel bad about setting boundaries? Does anyone else do this/know why we do this?

"Has anyone intentionally gone back in time to resurface your traumas? This only applies given the fact that you HAVE overcome addiction derived from PTSD or a particular trauma but this is open to all opinions of whatever your nature of suffering is or overcame. 

The reason I am doing this from 2018 - 2023 I worked for a boss who didn't do my tax or super. So doing stat Dec now. I was an apprentice (plumber), I'm extremely tough and I'm as tough as they come (I'm not boasting, its fact I was unbreakable), the company, 1 boss, 1 apprentice, company pays late all the time, boss was a narcissist, the anger the shouting all that jazz, paid annual leave 3 weeks after NYE THE FU**I*G DOG. Didn't bother me, I was good until 2022, caught by police unregistered work van (3rd time caught over a 5 month span THIS is when I mentally SNAPPED or soul left body), I used the van to go tafe for exams that day, that day I became an alcoholic, did too much for someone and left myself to shit like a slave. Overworked and red-lining, as in instead of working optimal like average society just turn up to work and go home do 9 to 5 where its somewhat pleasing, chat with co-workers, bludge a bit, pull sickies, not to worry much kinda things, proper company rules regarding employee saftey and treatement, no abusive behaviour, everyone respectfully monitored but my position? Throw all that shit out the window: this place required operating over the maximum capacity everyday, I was born for this but c'mon EVERYDAY! well super rare to get chill days (this is long story short.)

I printed 400 pages of bank statements, THEREFORE required to highlight wages paid as there were no payslips; company did not do group certificates, and instead of just high lighting the wages I went further resurfacing and writing down small entries I remember in a journal when seeing the dates and leaving notes on the bank statements, I found means to go through photos, messages, spending 5 hours on separate days apart through a 4 week period, marking days of trauma/what happened on normal days, I have successfully conjured the state that was in the past as of 25 OCT 2024. That meant I was sober for 5 months and I have decided to intentionally drink just to feel more of that old pain so I could write what that old self was feeling. Bringing my old self back who I tried killing.

If I've come this far why turn back? Before you all say it's a mistake, you must believe these following words; I am in control of this, I am powerful, it's just that this particular suffering that I spent a year forgetting never disappeared, everything I've overcame is not on any scale, my instinct leads me knowing Im ready to face my past and learn)

My tax is almost done 10% left. It was tough going through it and doing all this can be reused for another purpose like super insurance claims and workers comp documentation. Making a claim was never my intention but it seems as I'm doing my tax, it appears as though my notes reliving the past serve an extra purpose.

FYI: I stopped work July 19 2024 due to being diagnosed with AVN avascular necrosis. I cannot work like normal again. Hip needs surgery and I'm 33. Thankyou but I don't need sympathy as I am already humbled by my faith and my good Lord. I have time now to do this as I'm on a waiting list for surgery. Wait period is up to 12 months. ",ptsd

"I Really Need Help, Not Sure What to Do I was diagnosed with PTSD when I saw a therapist last year and I'm wondering if anyone has a similar problem as I do. I decided to see a therapist, because I didn't know what was wrong with me.

I have this problem where I am ""possessed with hatred"" over someone who bullied me or tried to intimidate me. I engage in this odd ritual, (not sure what this is or if it has a medical name), where I bite my hand and imagine violently killing and torturing the person who bullied or intimidated me. I'm not sure how to get rid of this, I just want it to stop.

Hatred is always haunting me. I remember events from my past where I was bullied, intimidated, made fun of, or tricked into doing something without understanding that I was being ""played with"". Some of these memories are over a decade old. 

It always begins with me feeling a strong sense of anger for not standing up for myself when someone bullied or intimidated me. Now it's gotten so bad, if someone honks at me or does something slightly intimidating or tries to make fun of me, I do this ""rage ritual"" of biting my hand and imaging myself killing them in a very violent way.

Up until 8 years old my life was pretty decent. Until I was raped and abused at 8. Suddenly almost over night I was no longer a kid anymore. It‚Äôs weird. The trauma changed me a lot and like it‚Äôs like I went from being a carefree innocent sweet trusting child too a cold empty shell. I no longer played with toys. I no longer played with my sister or my friends. And it kept on happening I kept on being raped for like a year. As ive gotten older Ive resented my childhood being taken from me so quickly. I should‚Äôve been a kid until I naturally was ready to transition into being older now I feel out of place from my peers.

Today I was having a really bad flashback then suddenly it was like I became a kid idk how to describe it like I felt like I was a child again like even my inner monologue was my childhood voice. Like I completely forgot about the trauma and I went into a drawer I keep of some of my old teddies and I started playing with them. It was really fun then suddenly halfway through I became myself again. And I started bawling my eyes out crying. 

I wish I could fully go back man. Maybe I could‚Äôve avoided it and my childhood would‚Äôve been intact just a little longer. Im the complete opposite of who I was back then. If pre trauma me found out what a monster I‚Äôve become she‚Äôd be devastated.",ptsd

"Symptoms resurfacing years after ART? Hi I hope this type of post is allowed. NOT asking for medical or diagnostic help!! Just wondering if current symptoms align with any accepted knowledge about ptsd/ART/ phobias. 

 I had pretty bad diagnosed ptsd after a single incident a few years ago. Happened when I was 18, received ART advance resolution therapy at 20 and it genuinely felt like I was ‚Äúcured‚Äù for years (specific triggers sometimes but not the regular day-to-day). 

I‚Äôm 23 now and I think a lot of it is back. But for no reason. I‚Äôm aware of retraumatization but NOTHING happened. I just noticed hyper-vigilance, tunnel vision, and mild dissociation is occurring now whenever I‚Äôm out at night, even in groups of people and in ‚Äúsafe‚Äù environments. 

I have a really bad phobia unrelated to ptsd (fully irrational one) and lately it has been so bad that I am constantly panicking no matter where I am. The thing is‚Äî I‚Äôve noticed my phobia gets more active when other things are at issue and although it‚Äôs always bad, it isn‚Äôt always ‚Äúcan‚Äôt walk down the street at night‚Äù bad. So when I‚Äôm having my hypervigilance etc. walking at night I am actively panicking about my phobia but the symptoms match what ptsd was like for me and are the same severity of my ptsd hypervigilance when the phobia version was never THAT bad. 

In short‚Äîcan ptsd randomly resurface with no external factors after years of it not really being an issue due to ART? And it is it possible that it‚Äôs the PTSD leftover even if I‚Äôm actively thinking (in the moment) that the panic is from a phobia?",ptsd

My gf‚Äôs (23 F) family own a mini market which is right next to her house. my gf and I where hanging out in a little staff office in the mini market when her dad and one of the employees walked in, the employee was very distressed and my my gf‚Äôs dad explained that one of her employees (40 F) got electrocuted by touching an outlet. my gf and her dad left to go see what happened with the outlet and i was left with the employee, i noticed she was looking extremely anxious and since i know how anxiety attacks are I tried comforting her and teaching her how to do breathing exercises to calm her down, when she was doing better i want to check on my gf an her dad, they where checking the security cameras and her dad was extremely mad because in the video he saw she touched her own phone charger not the outlet which she was trying to blame and he went to question her about it being very disrespectful and mean to her despite her being in an obviously bad state. seeing this whole situation made me very upset and it started bringing me flashbacks to situations where i was having anxiety episodes and people where yelling at me and putting me in even more distressed, i didn‚Äôt say anything at the time but i was felt very dissociated and anxious after that.

then my gf went to tell her mom about everything that happened while I was there, her mom and I have always gotten along fairly well despite her usually being a very antisocial person.
her mom started defending that it was good that she got yelled at, saying that she deserved it and that she was ‚Äúexaggerating‚Äù and ‚Äúa manipulative liar‚Äù that‚Äôs when i got re triggered. i started feeling the face of everyone who had treated me that way in her face. i was so mad and stressed. i started crying and telling her how i‚Äôve been in situations like that and that people deserve empathy especially it situations where they went through something terrifying and they aren‚Äôt doing well, the only thing that should matter is their well being nothing else. i noticed how i couldn‚Äôt even talk right anymore and i didn‚Äôt even know who i was talking to anymore so i left. 

my gf followed me and tried comforting me but i started realizing how much i fucked up and she definitely looked worried about it too. 
i told her i would apologize and before i left she went to her mom telling her about how i wanted to apologize but she refused to hear me.

a week later my gf went to her family home again and talked to her mom about it trying to give her my apologies and explain the situation but her mom was still mad and told her that she didn‚Äôt want me to go to her house anymore and tried telling my gf basically that i‚Äôm a bad person for doing what i did and that she should leave me. 

now I don‚Äôt know what to do. my gf is very understanding of my but she‚Äôs also a bit disappointed by what i did and her mom is still mad. I‚Äôm not trying to use my mental conditions to excuse myself but to explain how i felt i why i reacted the way i did. I wonder if i‚Äôm not the only person with mental struggles who ends up making mista like this and then hating themselves for it",ptsd
"An anxious shower experience I was in the shower this morning. Last night I had a really bad ptsd episode after several months, almost a year of being clean of it. In the shower, I was having flashbacks of little 3 year old me, unconscious after my parents had drugged me. They were moving my limp body to a hospital bed. They began to sit me up to take my clothes off. I could feel their and the doctors‚Äô hands touching me all over and holding me up. I could see my head drooping forward as they began to put the hospital robe on me. In the present I could feel the weight of their actions pressing on me and I couldn‚Äôt help but brace myself, tighten my glutes because they felt the most vulnerable and shake. I wish it hadn‚Äôt happened like this. I wish they cared for me and didn‚Äôt spend a lifetime neglecting me. Once I got out I thought of the way my parents used to hold me down firmly as I screamed and cried and said I was scared because during the ophthalmology check up the doctor would ask the secretary to put stinging eye drops on me that would dilate my pupil and prevent me from seeing. I felt so vulnerable and violated and scared. This would happened yearly. They would never pay me any mind, wouldn‚Äôt console me but simply stare and minimize my experience with their words. I wish I had parents who understood their actions and had the guts to face them and tell me they were wrong. Hell my throat hurts from writing this.",ptsd

Every time I remind myself I'm just in a dream I try to fight back but I am to weak to fight all the muscle I've built up just turns into rubber and I feel fatigued.

"Advice/ TW everything I do not know what to do anymore. Long story short: my mother‚Äôs a bipolar drug addict and my dad works 4 jobs. There‚Äôs 5 of us but 3 of my siblings got removed from my parents custody by child services years ago and so it was just me and my sister left. Last year was probably the worst year of my life abuse wise and the only reason I am here today is because of my sister, I can tell you right now my mother would‚Äôve killed me or I would‚Äôve killed myself if it weren‚Äôt for her. Now my sisters in college and it‚Äôs just me all alone, everything has been okay-ish, or as okay as it can be so far. With the occasional hits and fights and having to deal with my mother drunk/high. I‚Äôm currently writing this post at my chorus concert crying in the bathroom. I‚Äôm having an anxiety attack because last year after my mother had promised me she‚Äôd come to my chorus concert and she didn‚Äôt (I don‚Äôt even know why I expected her to she hasn‚Äôt been in years) I was really mad on my way back to my house when the concert had ended and when I walked into my house I found my mother passed out on the floor covered in blood. As I said before she‚Äôs bipolar. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm freaking out, but also sad that it‚Äôs my first concert my sister wont be at because she‚Äôs in college, and my dads working, so I have no one here. Another thing is ive been very hypervigilant because I can tell my mothers becoming manic and that mixed with the drugs sends her into this (sorry if I‚Äôm misusing the term) but like almost drug induced psychosis. Yesterday she was just standing outside out house with no shirt on screaming and banging on the garage doors and house and screaming at no one. But what makes me most nervous is how bad it got last time. Last time it got like this there was one really bad day, she basically tried to rape my father, and when he tried to get away she put a knife to him and then gave him the knife and started screaming/crying and begging him to murder her and when he wouldn‚Äôt kill her (because why tf would he) she punched him in the face repeatedly till he got a black eye, and then she came upstairs and was yelling at my sister so I was like leave her alone and she ended up coming to me and shoved me againt the wall, then putting me to the window telling me to jump out and kill myself and that no one needs me and stuft and I dont even know if id be here right now if it werent fir my sister who intervened. But im really freaking out right now an idek what I was lookijng to get out of this post other than to say I need help and I dont know what to do. I‚Äôm just a kid.

"I blocked someone who use to abuse me after an argument.¬† # 

I was bullied pretty badly in high school and faced racism. Anything from being addressed as the n word to being picked up and slammed to the ground while a friend of the main bully recorded me.

I‚Äôve gotten a black eye from him even and nearly went blind. He faced no consequences as he was a master manipulator and people like him for being the high school ""Jock‚Äù.

He always said sorry then repeated the behaviour and laughed with his buddies about it. He even made fun of my heritage (where my parents are from in Africa).

I get an apology about two years after high school and it (in my opinion) looked like an apology for himself. Sure, he said he‚Äôs sorry (he‚Äôs said it so many times it doesn‚Äôt hold value) and was more focused on saying in his apology ""I understand you probably hate my guts"".

I accepted the apology because my dad told me to.

Since then, I‚Äôve been through addiction & other not-so-proud stuff I‚Äôm not interested in sharing here. I decided to message him after all these years (been about 10 now) and it was a friendly message. Leaning towards me calling him a lovely person and how I understand if he still feels bad for what he did to me and said I understand the message could go unseen but I just wanted to share.

He, yet again, said he feels bad about how he treated me and said I look like I‚Äôm doing well and he‚Äôs happy specifically for that.

I just asked him why he called me the n word all the time and would beat me up over it. I asked if he found racism funny at the time. He denied absolutely everything he did. I then sent him screenshots of how he use to speak to me and he said ""Man, I don‚Äôt remember saying that, clearly I did though, there‚Äôs no denying that photo. I honestly don‚Äôt remember using that word with you or others. No one deserves that"".

For the sake of convenience of this post I‚Äôll make it short. We went back and forth over it ((and he said ""James, deep down, do you really want to message me day in day out about this? God doesnt want this for you man, im not him but i think hed want you to forigive and heal) and he then accused me of spreading rumours about him over the last two years that he r\*\*\*d his ex and said how I can‚Äôt deny that as he has these messages pinned to my IP address.

I blocked him and unblocked him after an hour saying how crazy that sounds and specifically said the last time we spoke was in 2018/19 when he messaged me out of the blue. I then tell him if he has all that info, what does he plan on doing with it? And said intimidation and what he claims to be true do constitute grounds for legal action and said we can take this to court.

He says ""James, for the hundredth time, I‚Äôm done with these conversations. Chao for now"".

I said ""for the record, I hope those things are not true Chris, I just can‚Äôt connect the dots on why you think it‚Äôs me who did that. Chao"".

After a few days, I blocked him for good.

"Feeling the need to always walk on eggshells around people online This is anybody who I feel comfortable around and have built respect for online.

I feel like they have somehow have a secret distain for anything I do, regardless if we're in active conversations or not.
Like, I'm afraid to ask them a question or make art for them, because I feel like they're gonna discard and gossip about me to people I don't even know.
I'm afraid to do something that would be even remotely perceived as wrong to them. I worry whether or not I'm even doing it right.

"Do I have PTSD or am I being dramatic? 
‚ÄºÔ∏èTW: ABUSE, DRINKING‚ÄºÔ∏è

So, my father was the worst type of person you could meet. He was a narcissistic, selfish man and only ever cared about himself.

He had a massive drinking problem, and was constantly drunk or hungover. 
Whenever I would so much as check the time on my phone, I would get yelled and screamed at. Sometimes he would even hit me.

Now, I always thought this was normal behaviour. I never told my friends about it because I figured what‚Äôs the point? 

One night I was playing with my little sister, when she accidentally bumped into the coffee table. My dad immediately looked over at me, and started yelling at me that I should be more responsible. I‚Äôm pretty sure he even hit me. I was too overwhelmed, so I ended up running to my room and just crying in bed. At some point my mother must have been called (my parents are divorced) because she had arrived and tried to comfort me. I ended up going home with her, and said I didn‚Äôt want to see him anymore. So I haven‚Äôt.

Anyways, back to the original point of this post, I‚Äôve recently been having flashbacks to that night and a few other bad nights, and it‚Äôs really taken a toll on me. I‚Äôve told some of my friends the brief version of what he did to me, but no one knows the full story except for me. 

Is this PTSD, or is it just a normal thing that comes with trauma?",ptsd
"Uncomfortable by T just saying ""okay"" when I disclose trauma or difficult events I have been seeing my T for trauma and to do EMDR (along with talk therapy and CBT). One thing that makes me really uncomfortable is that whenever I retell my trauma stories or tell her about a difficult experience, she'll just respond with ""okay"" as I'm telling the story and at the end. I know Ts needs to be neutral, not show any emotion/intense reactions and be nonjudgmental when clients disclose trauma, but it makes me feel crazy when I talk about something horrific and I get ""okay"" in response as if I just said I'm thinking of waffles over pancakes for breakfast tomorrow. It makes me feel many things, like she's not seeing the seriousness of what I am sharing or that she's not really listening.

Two months ago, I was telling T about one of my worst traumas: a major medical procedure in childhood where I was on the brink of death. The doctors were very callous towards me during and then after in recovery, even as I, for example, screamed bloody murder and was scared out of my mind and in pain. As I'm telling the story, with each horrible detail, I just get ""okay"" in response and then ""yeah, back then doctors didn't understand the psychological impact medical procedures had on kids."" Nothing even close to ""wow, that was horrible you went through something like that"" or ""it was wrong that they ignored your physical and mental suffering.""

Last month, I told her about the horror of recently going to get bloodwork and how they wouldn't let me lie down to do it so I ended up passing out on the floor. They tried lifting me and whacked my head hard on the floor instead. I managed to get up myself when they shook me awake, only to feel nauseous and vomit all over myself and collapse to the ground. At each point in the story, T goes just goes ""okay"" and then ""we can do some EMDR around that experience."" Again, T registers no shock or surprise at this experience and no reaction when I angrily ranted about the people at the lab, not even acknowledging that they behaved wrongly and inappropriately. I know she isn't supposed to pass judgment, but is she really not allowed to acknowledge that someone was obviously wrong?

Edit: I want to add that the ""okay"" response is for everything I bring to therapy, even if it's not trauma and just shitty experience. Some guy was riding my bumper and honking at me for three miles nonstop so I felt unbearably anxious? ""Okay."" A dentist's office lied to me about how much I'd have to pay out-of-pocket and charged me more? ""Okay."" An extended family member tricked me to get some money from me? ""Okay."" It's become maddening to me that T can never say or validate that those things or people are not right.",ptsd
"How do you find a happy medium?! I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2020. I basically ruined my life and as of January of this year, I‚Äôm bouncing back better than ever. Long story short, lots of drugs and alcohol and whatever else I could do to numb myself. But now, as I‚Äôm actually living fairly sober, I‚Äôm noticing I get very overwhelmed by how I structure my day. At first, I wasn‚Äôt doing jack shit. I work from home, so I‚Äôd just do that and play with my dog. literally the end of my day. Now, I‚Äôm really into fitness and have been for a few months, but there are some days where just thinking about having to work AND squeeze in a 40 min workout completely overwhelms me. I‚Äôm still able to do these things, but there‚Äôs a basically a mini meltdown in my brain for a good 2-3 mins. As long as I keep my feet moving, I‚Äôm fine. But it‚Äôs been getting worse and worse lately. I know I‚Äôm mentally better off when I have a very regimented schedule but now it feels like it‚Äôs too much? And when I think about it in the grand scheme of things, I‚Äôm not doing any more than I have in the past. I‚Äôve had to go into work and be a real adult even when at my worst and it didn‚Äôt feel this overwhelming. In addition to this, any time I leave my house for any reason, I‚Äôm nervous as shit. And it‚Äôs never anything specific, just a pit of fear in my stomach. I could be going to see family and I have to take something beforehand just to cope. Once I‚Äôm there, I‚Äôm good. It‚Äôs the getting there part. I had a date last night and almost threw up during the date. I‚Äôve never been this way.

Am I still getting acclimated to my brain? Does anyone else experience this?

"Am I lucky, abnormal, resilient, or just a ticking time bomb?  Hi all üëã I need to know if there's people like me out there. For context I'm a previously healthy 27yo female and 2 years ago had an unexpected massive MCA stroke. I was treated very quickly with a powerful clot-busting infusion which reversed 70% of the effects. It also triggered severe haemorrhage from some undiagnosed stomach ulcers (read: projectile vomiting pints of blood) which sent me to a resuscitation bay for an hour and a half.

I'm a veterinary surgeon by profession and during periods of consciousness fully understood the direness of the situation medically speaking. I probably would have at least offered euthanasia if this were happening to a dog. I experienced truly awful physical sensations including many different types and severities of pain, nausea, gasping air-hunger, pissing myself, and a relentless volley of non-consensual touch such as stripping/cutting of my clothes, attempts to access veins all over, urinary catheterisation, oral suction, and awakening to find a man cutting into my groin to place a pacemaking wire into my heart. Twice I politely asked a nurse if I was dying and twice I was told I was in the best hands (yikes).

I was told it was looking bad enough to need a medically induced coma but that survival to successful intubation in cases like this was poor. I was offered a priest but not access to my family in that moment(??). Ultimately they skillfully avoided the need for intubation by putting an endoscope down my throat and cauterising the bleeding while I choked on both the endoscope and my own blood. Don't get me wrong, I am actually grateful for that and impressed by it having performed lots of endoscopy myself.

Once stable, I spent time in ICU where the psychological trauma manifested itself as Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome) resulting in heart-attack-like symptoms and a couple of days of treatment for heart failure which did resolve.

After this was a relatively short (2 week) stint in stroke rehab where at the same time a region of skin died and fell off the inside of my right arm owing to escape of a drug under the skin during resus.

Emotionally, I had moments of raw fear for my family knowing the pain it would cause to lose me. I also quite naturally don't like pain or unexpected rough/intimate touch. But other than that, I cruised through the whole thing with a sense of acceptance and calmness, including the possibility of death. That especially wasn't a problem, in fact at moments I would have welcomed it as a relief.

I live on multiple medications and have some problems with strength, sensation, vision, fatigue and pain. But I have also since become an amateur climber and mountaineer in defiance. People ask about my visible scars, but I can speak openly about the experience and do so with a sense of humour and excellent story-telling. My partner (who I had not met at the time) finds this shocking. I have learnt information and techniques from the experience that I use on my patients.

I sometimes have dreams about drowning in blood and flickering ceiling panel lights give me enough sense of unease to try and move to a different room (I stared at one above me in resus). The sound of curtains on rails makes my hair stand up a bit. But that is all.

I declined every offer to see a psychotherapist or counsellor afterwards, didn't want to waste their appointments. I was raised by two nurses to be resilient and non-complaining, and I treat animals in various states of trauma every day. But I'm still surprised by how unaffected I am.

Are there others like me out there? Am I lucky to have the right brain chemistry to handle this, have my parents raised me well, am I a psychopath, or is this actually just suppression and in your experience is there a possibility this could all come out later in a big mess? Should I bother seeing a professional or can I just keep blissfully living my second life? I don't want to have to unpack it all unless absolutely necessary

Thank you all, and I'm sorry in advance that you have lived experiences that mean you are here to read this and respond. ",ptsd
"Why do incoviences or mild upsets send me spiraling at points? I'll have days or points where I'm ok but then something happens that's a bit upsetting and it sends me into a giant depressive spiral.

Even if it has nothing to do with my trauma, something negative popping up puts my head in a place to think about everything and anything else that hurt me, or is bothering me and when I get in that mindset I don't have the clarity to pull myself aside or stop myself in the depressive spiral.

For instance last night my boyfriend clarified to me that he didn't like me having a wish list and that it bothered him that I would just go to him for those things, I'm disabled and when I can't cover some things currently I feel more comfortable trying to find a way to get them on my own (nothing illegal) than risking feeling like a mooch despite that not really being an issue with my bf. I grew up with my mother as a single parent and to put it briefly I alway watch what I get and feel guilty or wrong when getting things I don't necessarily need.

So I made the wishlist as a ""if anyone feels like it, feel free to take a look"" essentially no obligation just it's there if anyone would like to. The items I put on it are items I hope or intend to get in the future either for my cat who has osteoarthritis or for me to help with rough points of my disabilities or to help me further my education and studies.

My boyfriend didn't say anything bad and actively promoted it the first time, then yesterday this time the second time I promoted it he had an issue with it and said it was about principal.

I wasn't promoting it in anyway that was wrong relationship wise or suggestive/nsfw and there's nothing like that on my list. I simply mentioned it  very off to the side and not in tour face of an account of mine.

He had an issue with it, and was insinuating I should delete it. I went ahead and did but I let him know I was disappointed that it was an issue and that he disliked it so much, I by the end told him that I'd like him to clarify more why it bothered him as he really only gave ""a matter of principal"" and ""I really don't like any online relationships"" (it's an anonymous wishlist so idk what he means, and I made sure he knew the wishlist wouldn't have me talking to anyone or vise versa or revealing any personal info.)

I was upset after this because the night I repromoted it I had added a good amount more and had put a good amount of time into picking things out and adding little descriptions.

By the end of all this I deleted anything promoting the wishlist and any links to them but I was upset it felt like I had to do that at all. I let him know I wasn't happy with the outcome and didn't really get to finish before he decide he was gonna head back to bed cutting me off in the process. (I have asked him not to start uncomfortable or messed up conversations/the like before bed at a point before this because his go to is to start it and then cut it off when he realizes it's late despite it already being late when he brought it up.)

So I went to bed upset when I had been good and then the spirals started, I started feeling down fell asleep, woke up again during the night in a depressive mental state couldn't sleep to almost 5 am and during the time I let him know about the other things that were bothering me or had me in a bad mindset. (Our time zones are different right now so when it was almost 5 for me it was regular morning hours for him)

And I just UHG I'm so tired and exhausted of deteriorating into these spirals and then feeling like a giant burden after.

I can't control them and I don't know what to do. My therapist has given me ways to try and break the spiral but I feel that don't really do anything and I'm still in the same spot mentally.

I'm insanely lonely and all I have right now is my cat, family is abusive and or far away and don't reach out much. Family friend is also out of the country and was supposed to vome back sooned but made the assumrion that I'm fine because i'm doing well with my studies and decide to stay longer without talking to me, my boyfriend is studying abroad and gets exhausted with any sort of emotionally taxing conversations and just shuts down most of the time, and I have no emotional support network I'm completely alone and I'm ok sometimes and then I have days where I just break down and can't handle it, and then I can't even vent that much because no one can handle it or is abusive and I can't share this stuff with them.

I feel like I'm losing my mind, I can't get anything more important done without help and I have little to none right now and the help I do have is anxiety inducing and very spotty/unreliable.

"Extreme abuse survivor success stories make me feel worse Title sounds awful, but to elaborate I absolutely want people to overcome PTSD and find success, I really do hope we are all able to feel safe and have beautiful futures soon.

I feel bad feeling this way because I'm sure they did not mean to make me feel like crap for not suddenly getting my crap together now that I'm ""free"", and as I learn more about PTSD it's left me feeling like I could never reach anywhere near their heights. Some of the biggest stories involve abuse far more severe than my own, and it makes me mad at myself that instead of creating my own small business and becoming an ""inspiration"" I struggle to get out of bed, brush my hair and feel anxiety talking to a cashier. 

I'm not sure if they never had those years of being stuck, realising they don't have an identity outside of their trauma, lack of drive to do anything and feeling alien from every regular person around them because no one could possibly relate. Did they share their story back then or hide it? Was adjusting to the real world also incredibly hard to do? Were they also emotionally unstable? Did they deal with years of foggy memories and fatigue? Did they also feel more hopeless outside of the abuse? 

Idk, it's just hard trying to find examples of success where it doesn't jump from the worst things I've heard to suddenly having a loving family, living upper middle class and being believed. I would be heartbroken if they were putting on an act, but I wish they would talk more about how long it took to actually recover. ",ptsd

"A lyric I found that just spoke to me so much... and made one thing make sense. ""They say time is a healer, life is a teacher  
Show you, show you the way  
They say time is a healer, making you stronger  
Well, if that's the case

**Then how am I still wounded?**""

  
The word *wounded* adds a layer not found with some other metaphors for trauma. Something I have been experiencing ever since I saw that ghost (my own).

A *scar*, once the injury is healed, doesn't hurt passively. It's a reminder of pain, but might not be pain itself.

  
A *wound* can hurt all. the. time. Even when it's not a sharp pain, you're always aware of it. And the smallest poke or stretch can set the wound ablaze. As if you're being wounded all over again. It's omnipresent. Always weighing down on you, even during your victories, big or small. Deciding to raise its voice just as you begin to relax after a hard day. Keeping you up at night.

"I have never shared my trauma on a platform with strangers before. Can it be classified as sexual abuse? I really wish I was held right now. I was born with severe astigmatism and strabismus (exotropia) on my left eye. After appointments made with approx. 8 doctors, they kept measuring the angle of my eyes I grew to know when the right time for surgery was. I was three years old when my parents lied to me. They hadn't allowed me to eat anything all day, saying we'd get fast food after we ""visited grandma at the hospital"". I was happy about it so we took the car. We stayed waiting in the waiting room for at least 2 hours. Suddenly, who I now know at the my ophthalmologist of like 10 years walked in and called us in a room. There was a painting of a ship battling a wild tide, more chairs with fake leather and those gold buttons lining them. I was asked if I wanted a drink. He came in with a white plastic cup filled with orange juice: but it looked dull, grey-ish, and smelled fishy. I tried a small sip and didn't like it, but I was pressured into drinking it all. I noticed my parents staring at me with tears in their eyes, crying. I felt panicked/distressed at the site, but suddenly my eyelids began to droop, I felt heavy, swaying on my feet. I felt sleepy in the most artificial way possible. They sedated me. My mom held me in her arms as I finally succumbed to the drug. I woke up with excruciating pain in my left eye. They'd covered it with one of their white patches. I was in hospital clothes on a hospital bed in hospital room. My grandma had never been there. A lady I didn't know came in with a dinosaur plushie, saying she was rewarding for being brave. I didn't know what she was talking about, I think they had me on other painkiller drugs. My parents never cared beyond my physical state, never asked how I felt ever in my life. They lied to me about everything. At the doctor's they would kick me out of the room, look at me weirdly and slam the door in my face any time my surgery had to be talked about. When I had the courage to bring it up, once I was beginning to remember the more I grew, they could only talk about how THEIR actions hurt THEM, not even acknowledging my struggle. My trauma manifested a lot in my dramatic play with dolls. They somehow always ended up drugged and at the hospital and then the scenario would go blank. It was as if my mind was asking me ""what next?"" I experienced severe reactions once I fully remembered everything at age 12. I felt so betrayed, anxious, and terrified of my family. Whenever I set a boundary such as ""don't touch me"", they always violated it despite my protests and fear every time. It still happens. I was severely emotionally neglected in all aspects. Later on, I began feeling the hands of the surgeons crawling up my back, and grabbing my ass and squeezing it. I would get flashbacks of myself unconscious getting stripped of my clothes by strangers, without my knowledge or consent. How they had to open my eyes with their fingers and tools while they operated on me, and my gaze being blank, innocent, unaware. I'm shaking while I'm writing this. I felt a complete loss over my body, I am 17 now and full relaxation is the most daunting thing to do. I have refused to ever attend services like spas or massages in fear of having to lay facing down naked. I have frequent and intense thoughts of rape and it is one of my worst fears. It's just the fact that I was an innocent girl getting touched by strangers, even in a non-exploitative way, their hands all over my body, then literally opening and slicing and stitching it while my parents did absolutely nothing. Told me nothing. Offered me no support. Avoided me. Left me and every possibility of a good childhood seep into oblivion. I wish I could say I value family, but it is what I fear the most. I'm having trouble expressing this right now but I am hoping you people will have something consoling to say. Thank you for reading this and I appreciate you. I have never been comforted on the matter before.",ptsd

"is it possible to barely even remember what happened? When i was around 6 i was SA‚Äôd.

Recently, I‚Äôve even discovered that more things happened that I cannot remember at all and didn‚Äôt even know happened to me.

She's been trying so hard to help me through stuff and deal with my issues, but it's been taking a huge mental toll on her especially over summer.

Last night we had an argument and after talking in the car for over an hour I told her that I cannot keep letting my trauma effect our relationship and cause her pain.

She kept asking me not to leave her, and i don't know how to take that. We aren't on bad terms, not even slightly. Last thing she did was kissed me and said she loves me, but I cannot keep letting my illness slowly ruin her too.

So after therapy, I'll forget a buncha the stuff we discussed, and so I feel like I'm not getting as much out of it as I could be tbh. I remember asking my therapist if they could share the details of our session with me. Just a summary or something like that after each one. They didn't seem very open to it 

The struggle is that I really want these notes, because without them, I just feel like I have a productive time \*during\* therapy, but then I get home and feel like I'm back at square one. I'm tired.

"Almost Died First time posting, hello my name is Paul. I have so much to say, will try to make it as short as possible. Well, let's start at the day of my accident. I work as a maintenance man at a housing complex. The job was to remove a toilet and replace it with a new one. I completed that task and was throwing the toilet away in a dumpster. Somewhere in the process the bottom had gotten broken. The toilet bounced when I threw it in. It slice me write down the middle of my arm, the inner part right at the elbow. I looked down and it was wide open. I grabbed it and started holding it together. Bleeding all the way back to my car. I started asking for help. Someone who was they're trimming trees saw me. She immediately took off her belt And applied it as a turnicate. It was gushing pretty bad. But thankfully she slowed it and I owe her my life. I had lost so much blood.At that point I started throwing up and then lost my vision And also having trouble hearing. When the ambulance arrived. I was in and out of it. When I arrived at the hospital It became one of the worst experiences of my life. Because of the emergency they couldn't give me any pain medication at that point. Because it had sliced me down to the bone and severed the artery. They started sewing it without any pain medication. I felt everything really bad hand pain because of the turnicate. At that point they had started given me blood, my vision started coming back. When they finished with the artery , they were able to give me pain medication. I was kind of in shock at that point. They were actually surprised buy how calm I had been threw the whole thing. I think that to because I was dying. I was told I lost over three liters of blood. People always talk about that. Seeing the light or other things like that. What I saw was a literal flash of my life. I was thinking of my wife and kids. Family and friends I had lost contact with. Family and friends that I had lost ect. This next part, I will make short.It could actually be a whole separate story. I was cleared to work only after ten days. I came back and I still think I was in shock. I lifted a water heater hurt myself again. Then was out another three months. When I came back my employer Just treated me like trash and has been for awhile. I came back with restrictions.  When they were up They came up with minor reasons to give me right ups, to make me look bad. I believe they were doing this to set me up to get fired or something. The accident happened in September 2023. I have all sorts of nerve and muscle issues, And don't have the strength or confidence to find a new job yet or else I wouldn't be here. I've just been feeling horrible about myself. Have constantly thinking about death and the accident. Don't know what to do, or where to go from here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

"Attn folk with PMDD: Anyone else here have random shame/guilt arise during their ovulation/luteal times?  Hi folks,

I am reaching out to you as well as the u/cptsdwomen and u/pmdd groups to try and see if this is more than just trauma rising up.

**This post is primarily for women, femmes and all who menstruate** (or who used to) and have un/diagnosed PMDD... pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder - a disorder often co-morbid with PTSD and CPTSD.

*Some context*

I have CPTSD from old stuff, PTSD from new stuff, and PMDD throughout all the things since age 9. I've been through some scary times since COVID and experienced a couple crimes that brutally affected my life within the past two. The legal after effects as well as fallout financially and healthwise are with me everyday.

BUT (hopefully) the worst is over and I can keep plugging away and slowly healing.

What's happening as the outer stuff eases (from complete chaos to normalised hardship), **my past two cycles, I've noticed an old** ***old*** **shame/guilt feeling creep up and blanket me come up from out of nowhere.** Had that happen *lots* as a child. It would take over while at a friends' house or while watching a movie or in an otherwise pleasant, low-key situation.  (Yep, there's abuse from back then too)

I have a trauma counsellor (she's on vacation til end of month). I do all the things (as best I can) and have had to do so since the past two decades when it comes to mental/physical health. So I'm not a newbie to the 'work' and not looking for advice like ""talk to your counsellor"" (because I will :)

*My question* ü§î

**What I am trying to figure out is if others  who mentstruate also notice weird and random waves or bogs of shame take over during otherwise ok moments or within a mild trigger or interaction? Especially during/after ovulation and during the luteal phase?** I need to know if I am alone in this or if there are others finding this happen in there cycle too.....

**If this is relatable, would you be willing to share?** I'm trying to figure out what's happening beyond ""old trauma is coming up, if you don't know exactly what""....

Thank yooooooou for reading and considering!

"Trying to Figure Out if I'm a Jerk I had PTSD from a coma years ago. A year or two ago I went through a 30 day 100% sleepless spell. My egg cracked. In the immediate aftermath I had either nightmares or breakdowns or both of all kinds of hellish things where I literally thought I was in hell. It gave me CPTSD. After things were better for me, I sought out help first from a psychiatrist who gave me daytime Prazosin and Buspar which helped a lot. Then I started seeing a psychologist who might be helping already. But as I become more and more me, I'm walking around just agreeing with people a lot less. I don't agree with them so I say so. One of my dearest relationships was with my now-grown nephew. He bluntly told me he was ready to choke me when I was so sick because all I did was agree with what he had just said. It was all I could do. Now I can do more. So I've told him a few times when I see things differently and he gets offended and won't talk to me for a day or two. The problem is, he's 29 years old and only wants to talk about the video game he's playing, the movie he's watching, or the new toy he bought. It's better when we're together, but I never see him in person. On the phone, when he will (I'm not making this up) give me permission to call him, I talk a lot more but he doesn't say that much. I want him to be happy and have the things he wants. But our family is full of people who are having a lot of problems and our country is having a lot of problems, and I get to hear about the 99th remaster of Doom. Who gives a fuck? I asked for permission to talk to him last night and he said ""I really don't feel like it. I had a busy day at work."" I told him I'd try to pretend that wasn't really hurtful and said goodnight. He said nothing and no thing ever since. When you need permission to call, when talking to someone is such a chore that a busy day at work makes you too tired to endure it, is there a relationship left to save? When I was going through my very bad time he barely made an appearance. I had thought of him as one of my closest friends. He said he could tell there was something wrong with me, but i would talk about it. So he just quit coming around. Thanks for caring. Now I feel like, if I lose this relationship, am I losing anything? It hurts me to think about this stuff. It hurts me the way he treats me. We were close until I got sick, then he got bored and moved on. Me and my ex-wife were close until I got PTSD, then she didn't like that I had been so sick so she started cheating on me then left me. When you get PTSD, even if you don't abuse them, do people just walk away from you? How do you even go about finding new people. My world is almost empty. If I'm driving people away to figure out how before there's nobody left. If I have to pretend I agree with everything people say and never give my opinion to be in a relationship with them, am I in a relationship with them?",ptsd

"Trauma that made me depressed for 1 year  So, in September 2023, I was about 12 and I was told to completely cut down on my hobby (Crafting and aviation) due to academic reasons.

I used to love travel and the South American country I lived in. I lived there alone and everything. Now the last thing I can think about is being distant from family. My throat closes up if I travel without a loved one with me. It sounds stupid I guess, but my body has this response that if I'm not around and something happens to my mom/dog/dad/sister, I'm bad

I lost my love relationship partially because I'm still healing. I've ""integrated"" the loss, but I'm just off. I'm not the same and I'm not happy like this. My social life, romantic life, etc. suck and I am living with mom (36/m).

"Tips and tricks I‚Äô a 40-year old woman that am afraid to feel positive feelings after quite a lot of different trauma. The latest trigger was a 6-month relationship that just ended.

After we broke up, I‚Äôve been having what I THOUGHT was anxiety, the tears, the shaking and sometimes hyperventilating. I then discovered that when I could let go of fear, it was so much self love hidden behind that fear.

"Having trouble navigating my ptsd. *This post could potentially be a trigger for some people.* I have never posted on Reddit before but it seems to be a successful place for connecting with others feeling similar.
My 25 yr daughter had an overdose in March 2024. The overdose led to 4 serious cardiac arrests, 50 mins of CPR including paddles, kidney failure so dialysis was started. She was in a coma for 10 days and by some literal miracle she woke up! The feelings of happiness - there are no words to describe it.
During this time our 6 yr grandson was with us and that was another hurdle to navigate. I was terrified that I was going to have to tell him his mommy is gone. That was heart wrenching beyond words as well. 
My daughter is doing well, sober and working towards having him back with her. I‚Äôm very proud of her progress and support her 100%.

Now here I am and the dust is settling and I am slowly falling into a horrible paralyzing depression. I get things done that are needed but I feel so empty inside, so disconnected and I cannot stop thinking about it all. 
I don‚Äôt know how to feel like myself anymore. I‚Äôm depleted and very disassociated with my emotions and even things like feeling hunger.
I have done some counseling and will continue to do so but I wanted to connected to others that could possibly relate.

TW: Staturatory/Grooming/Emotional and physical abuse/mention of SA

So when I was 15, I was freshly traumatized from being SA'd by my friend and was quite frankly very messed up. I wound up meeting a guy in high school we'll call Victor. Vuctoe was someone that kept to himself, only had a couple friends, etc. We shared the same (awful) friend group and this started a relationship I wish I was never apart of. Note at this time he was 19, I was 15, and I took of it being wrong but he played all the right cords and every little lie and promise so that I would trust him. I started noticing alarming things when his family member would make comments like ""you'll find better hook ups in college"" and no one corrected the brothers behavior. He wound up convincing me to give up my v card in exchange for his and I'll never forget him and his father shaming me for it and making me make a promise that I would never tell my mother about me and him having sex because in his words ""I would go to jail."" It continued through the years but it wasn't the sex that wasn't the only thing. His parents shamed me for having a disorder I couldn't control and having a menstrual disorder that I also couldn't control. I later found out me not controlling it was because of the extreme stress he put me under. When we graduated high school together, I wound up doing a vast majority of his college work including essays, math work, assignments, etc. During this I was shamed often, locked out of conversations when he got upset and would ghost me, threaten to leave me, and when he'd be ""better"" it turned into love bombing in which I fell all over again because I swore he loved me. He dumped me back in late May and by the time he did, he was abusing edibles because he wanted a ""happy"" feeling. All we did was fight, and when he broke up with me it was like the gates of heaven opened. I felt a lot of weight off my shoulders. However then the harassment started a couple days later. Him telling me he couldn't live without me, that he loved me, that he needed me, etc because I wouldn't respond and just left him on seen. I had to file a police report because he showed up to my house, my father had to get involved to tell him to leave me alone and not come back, it was horrific. Now six months later, I'm in a new relationship and although I'm very happy I am horrified and angry at the things I have seen and the questions that have been answered as to why I felt so bad both physically and mentally. I'm angry almost everyday, I'm writing my ass off everyday in my notes app and never posting, and him and family members of his continue to stalk my social media frequently, and I've now had to block several accounts from both him and his family. I am sick. I am tired. I want peace and quiet without having to feel like I'm so unloveable because someone tore me when I was already down. I wish I wasn't so stupid and shattered as a teenager that it drives me crazy. I feel like I cannot be loved and that I'm not worthy of it. Frequent nightmares of him getting violent and putting his hands on me, etc. I'm just tired. I want to be free from the anguish I went through. I wasn't the best person either but I wish someone understood.",ptsd

"1 year since my assault and im having a hard time coping Last Halloween I was raped at a party when I was severely intoxicated. I blacked out for almost the whole thing. I dont know if I was really just that drunk or if my brain made me forget it. afterwards my friend and her gf (my best friend of 16 years) slut shamed me for it. one of them who was at the party made me feel guilty cause she felt guilty? she told her mom and many other people without my consent. her mom, who I saw like a mother figure to me, said if I ever did something like that again she wouldn't let me be around them. 

for months I was called a whore/slut (""jokingly"") and anytime we drank they'd remind me to ""not get too crazy cuz remember what happened last time"". the first time we met my now boyfriend, she told him and his friend about it and tried to spin it to make it seem like I deserved it. and I believed that I did. I was in denial that it was rape. once I finally told my therapist and 1 of my sisters I started to believe that I truly was a victim. around march I quit talking to my friends without explanation and they haven't even tried to reach out. they were my only friends. I feel so betrayed. 

all this month ive been an anxious and emotional wreck. ive had numerous outbursts of crying and panic attacks. I had to work at 1 of my jobs early this morning anf it didn't even comprehend in my brain what today was. I was in autopilot.  I got home and was getting ready for my 2nd job and I got crippled with so much fear. I called in and can't even move off the couch. im scared to go outside to take my dogs for a walk. and ive been sobbing off and on. my boyfriend is obviously aware of what today is but he's got work so he cant be with me all day. I want to keep the ugly crying to myself for now anyway til he gets back home. I'm just so sad and hurt. october is my birth month. I used to enjoy it so much. I would look forward to it every year.

"It's Not The Event That Upsets Me Most, It's The Fact It Can Happen Again If I'm Not Careful. My story isn't that unique but I have been subjected to bullying, humiliation, thrown to the wolves, raped, sexually assaulted and left to die. 

It's not the fact that the event that triggers me, it's the fact that it happened when I was in a vulnerable position and that I had little to no support system to rebound me from my trauma.

I was never taught to stand up for myself (raised by two narcissistic parents) and saying 'no' was a bad word around my house. Since then, after thr attacks, I cannot let my guard down for anything.

I can't let friends in because I have the fear of them using my vulnerabilities against me and I can't let partners in because I was used for the body in the past. 

I can't let my guard down because when I did, this is when the attacks happened. I have to stay vigilant. I have to constantly scan my surroundings and no trust a single soul, even if they prove themselves ""worthy"" of my trust.

I'll kick it off;

I'm from NL. Worked in the militairy for 5y, in law enforcement for 18y. Suffered from work related c-PTSD from my time in the police. Worked, amongst other things, as a k9-officer, riot police, first response unit and special guard unit. During my many years on the street i saw a lot of horrible things, i've shot a guy, suffered hearing damages, was assaulted, threatned etc. 

I'm in treatment for over 2y now and will prob. be (medically) discharged in the near future. In my country you will need to be examend by a basic insurance physician before discharge. He/she will decide how many % you are unfit for duty which will correspond with how much benefits you will get. Sometimes a very dishonest and respectless process which gives a lot of stress. This semi-goverment agency doesn't want to pay ofcourse, so they are know for telling ppl to work insane jobs which are not capabel of working. This agency is a lot in the news here lately about how they operate.

"Victim of SA ‚ö†Ô∏è don‚Äôt read if ur sensitive to sa 

four years ago, i think somewhere in april 2020, it was night and i was sleeping. i woke up in the middle of the night to my mom‚Äôs husband touching me. I remember my shirt was lifted up and he was touching my cl!t. I screamed my mom‚Äôs name but she didn‚Äôt hear me. He also left without saying anything after i screamed. I was flabbergasted about what just happened but i went back to sleep. When i woke up, I told my mom about this later after it happened but she didn‚Äôt believe me at all. She only believed me when her husband admitted it like months later. Because of this, i always act like a ‚Äúbitch‚Äù around both of them. Arguing is very common in our household and my mom always blames these on me. She keeps telling me I need to grow up and that it‚Äôs easy to get along with her husband if I just act nice towards him. But im only like this because of what he did to me; anytime I told my mom this, she scoffs it off and tells me that it‚Äôs just my excuse for acting like a bitch. She doesn‚Äôt even side with me. It was four years ago and i haven‚Äôt told the authorities about this but i really want to because it‚Äôs troubling my mind ever since then, and it will probably be like that forever. One reason i dont wanna tell the authorities is bc hes really old and is very sick so i dont want him to spend his last year behind bars. But i might tell the authorities because im getting tired of him always arguing with me and my mom. Hes very verbally abusive. Also i have proof of him admitting he touched me. i js dont know what to do with it. I might tell my school counselor about this but i dont know what will happen to me. My mom will probably hate me and i will probably be sent back to my home country, which i dont want to happen to me. Also, this happened four years ago when I was 11 years old. I‚Äôm scared no one will side with me and my mom and her husband will send me back to my country or do something bad to me. I told my friend if i should tell anyone but he said i should wait till im 18 (im 16 right now). Do you guys have any suggestions of what I should do?

"One of my biggest fears came true - I had a flashback in public and a random person was really rude and judgmental I was at a store and saw an upset kid who reminded me of a kid I'd met in Afghanistan years ago, a kid who witnessed something a kid should never, ever witness. I was there too, but I was 19 - the poor kid was 6, if I remember correctly. I can't even imagine how much worse it was for him.

Fast forward to 2024, I see this kid at the store about his age who for some reason looked almost just like him. I don't know what he was upset about, but he was upset about something. I think he lost his parents in the store but I'm not sure. He turned, made eye contact with me, hugged me (or as much of me as he could reach from his height) and started crying. Long story short, I ended up on the floor right along with him, holding him and bawling my eyes out. 

This one lady walks by, looks at me, and says, ""What the fuck is wrong with you? What are you trying to accomplish? You want attention, well you got it - now what do you want?""

I could barely say anything but I managed to tell her that he reminded me of someone I'd met years ago. Something like that. I don't remember exactly what I said. 

She started yelling at me, saying how ""Everyone just wants to play the victim those days"" and all that. 

Playing the victim was the very last thing I'd wanted to do. I just wanted to go to the store and come back home like a normal person. I'm not proud of myself for what happened either, but I feel like there was absolutely no reason for her to be an ass about it.",ptsd

"Was I even raped? How do I deal with this betrayal?  TW- Sexual abuse 

Some background- I have chronic anxiety, C-PTSD, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD. I was originally put on an SSRI (Paxil) when I was 10 for anxiety and panic attacks. I'm currently on medications and in therapy.
Both my parents have seen my mental illnesses impact my life and evolve. 

**I remembered I got molested from ages 9-11 by my best friend's dad when I was around 21. He did horrible things to all of us. After remembering, I lost it. I became suicidal, it triggered my bipolar tendencies, it was bad. My mom convinced me to break up with my bf (same man I'm seeing now) and move down to Florida to get some ""help"". I went to the psych ward a few times because of them but they didn't help. They actually kicked me out because ""I got a staph infection""... 

NO! My cousin raped me in my sleep shortly after moving down there. I had my sleep apnea face mask on. I couldn't consent. I just woke up and he was inside me. That's rape, right? 

Every time I bring up the fact that they still talk to and hang out with him they get really defensive. My mom blames me for what happened because ""I should've known better than to spend the night"". She blamed my illnesses and said drugs may have been involved. I DON'T EVEN DRINK ffs! 

I wanted to go to the cops. My rents wouldn't let me. After me making that threat I was no longer allowed at family functions. My dad even forbid me from going to my grandmother's funeral üòî 

I eventually got worse and worse. I was always in hysterics; constantly crying. I would call my mom when that happened because, well, she's my mom. One day she said to me, ""I went to the doctor and he said if I keep talking to you like this I'm going to have a heart attack and die and I'm not willing to die for you."" So, I backed waaaaaay off. Eventually, being unmedicated was too much for me and I couldn't work. I got evicted. 

I HAD TO SLEEP IN MY CAR! SO DANGEROUS FOR A WOMAN IN FLORIDA! THEY DIDN'T CARE! Then I had to move in with an autistic man with mental illnesses who forced me to do sexual stuff for my medications. I couldn't take it anymore and caved, called my parents and asked if they could put me up in a hotel (they're loaded and have no shortage of cash). I had just filed charges for sexual battery and had nowhere to go. I was surprised that they gave me any money at all. They were convinced I was on drugs and basically disowned me for a few years. I wasn't on drugs. I was undiagnosed and unmedicated bipolar.

"Yes, checking the mail triggers me badly due to medical bill trauma. (American) I hate checking the mail due to fear of medical bills. The PTSD original trauma was nothing to do with the mail. However, having to deal with the trauma itself, while being forced by survival (here in America) to continue to work while recovering from the trauma with no available rest (mental/medical) period, and not having emotional sense of survival security due to finances has caused checking the mail to become triggering on its own.

I'm hoping to spread awareness that yes, common ""minor"" ""necessities for survival"" can put additional mental burdens on people who are already struggling, so it's not okay to blame people for not being able to excel like people without the invisible burden of ptsd. It's wrong to blame people for seeming to just not be able to ""get it together"".

"I don't feel like I should be traumatized over what happened to me. (Work-related, long) It's a bit of a confusing story, I can't explain the whole thing without basically making a book. 

Early this year I was at an internship for college (off campus), and had conflict with one of my supervisors on the site. They clearly did not like working with students and did not want me there, but I needed them to teach me/reinforce certain skills to pass the internship, and I confronted them firmly but in as professional terms I could about it. It only made things worse. By their own admission, I was not the first student they had problems with.

Soon after, a piece of my personal property went missing, which I figured was coincidence, but then another one was tampered with. I finally reported the situation to my university. Again, this only made things more tense, and I was getting into conflicts with this supervisor multiple times a day every day.

Eventually, I was accused of cheating on a certain task. I don't know whether it was a deliberate setup or a mere coincidence with how that happened, but regardless, the site reported me to my university. I was absolutely terrified I was going to be kicked out of college. Had a mental breakdown as soon as I left for the day. Fortunately, to my university, the entire situation was suspicious, and I was sent to a new site to finish my internship, and had no problems there. 

For awhile, I thought I'd gotten over it, until these last couple of months. I graduate in December and I am terrified of getting a job in the field I had my internship in, but it's the only thing my degree applies to. I keep getting flashbacks and having nightmares. I keep trying to reason with myself when the anxiety hits, and it works temporarily, but it always comes back. And while I'd never actually do it, I fantasize about purposefully failing this last semester so I can delay getting a job. 

To boot, I did witness something very horrific at the new site I was sent to, at the fault of no one, it was just an extremely unfortunate event. I played Tetris after because I knew it might give me flashbacks and heard that may help. I haven't had any flashbacks or nightmares about that incident and I feel guilty that out of the things my brain chooses to be traumatized by, it's by someone being mean to me rather than something that actually ruined people's lives.  

I just don't understand why I'm so caught up over something that ultimately worked out in my favor. I feel like I need someone or something to smack my head on straight. ",ptsd
PTSD and LSD Has anyone had a really bad trip that feels like it changed their mental status? I am going on a year of having a terrible first and last trip off acid and I have yet to feel normal again. Countless days where I want to just end it all because of how I feel on an existential level. All of my feelings of sadness or horror are just heightened through the roof. I get really nice breaks from it and it gives me hope that I can actually be better one day but my lows are extremely low to the point I get extremely scared of what is going on in my brain. Is anyone else dealing with this or have gone through this before? I want to know what I can do to help restore my mental health or at least deal with what I‚Äôm feeling.,ptsd
"Overlap of ADHD and childhood trauma My psychiatrist mentioned the other day that the manifestation of childhood trauma can look very similar to ADHD and/or ODD.

Personally, it‚Äôs impossible for me to untangle the two.

Curious if any of you were also diagnosed with ADHD as a child in the years following childhood trauma, and if you think your ADHD was possibly misdiagnosed because your trauma was overlooked (maybe because it went unreported or even because you didn‚Äôt see it as trauma at the time)?",ptsd

"Hallucinations Hello, I just recently got diagnosed with PTSD. I previously was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder from ages 17-24. I‚Äôm now 24.

I guess I‚Äôm coming on here to ask others if they also see and hear things when they are under a lot of stress? They‚Äôre always shadow people. It also would be the same shadow people I see when I get sleep paralysis. I also will hear a baby crying in my ear before sleep or whispers. Again, this only happens when I‚Äôm under extreme stress and can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôve seen and heard things probably only like 10-15 times since I was 12.

"Why I don‚Äôt like Halloween  So since Halloween is tomorrow, and loads of people are excited about it, naturally I talked to my counsellor and she asked me why I don‚Äôt really care for it that much. I thought I would tell y‚Äôall what I told her because maybe you can relate.

I‚Äôm 19, so on Halloween probably around 11-12 years ago, me, younger my brother, my mum and my brother‚Äôs dad (he ain't and will never be my step dad but that's a whole different story) went trick-or-treating, as normal families do. Now, I am probably on the spectrum so when I was a kid, I had a lot of sensory issues but I've worked on them and I'm doing great now. Anyway, we wrapped up trick-or-treating in our neighbourhood and headed over to my brother‚Äôs grandparents‚Äô house so we could get candy from them. So, we get there and I rang the doorbell, and instead of someone opening the door to give us candy, they OPEN THE DOOR AND FUCKING SPRAY ME STRAIGHT IN THE FACE WITH SILLY STRING‚Ä¶ as I said, I was a very sensitive child so I didn't take kindly to that, and that incident basically ruined Halloween for me. Since then, I have decided to skip over Halloween entirely and start the holiday season early. 

I don't know if this belongs here but I thought I would tell the story somewhere, and maybe someone will relate to it, who knows? Some people think it's kinda odd, or I'm rigid but whatever. I don't care for Halloween parties, I rarely ever dress up (and if I do it's a low-quality costume to fit in because I have to), but I do enjoy the cheap candy üòÇ. 

Anyway, hope you enjoy your Halloween, if you celebrate!",ptsd

"Being misunderstood is such an awful trigger It's so hard to function every day enough.
It's when you don't intend to be mean but people just take you as such and just escalate it to the point where they start to affirm your already negative self talk. They assume the worst and they basically tear you down and say bad things to trigger you until you lash out at them. Then they turn it around on you and call you ""immature, irresponsible, childish,"" for snapping back.
People just think your a malicious subhuman and not a human who's been mentally and emotionally damaged repeatedly and can't barely function because of it.
People on most subreddits are so cynical and lack so much in understanding and basic empathy. They assume the worst and don't bother to care a bit. Then when they trigger you and you become defensive, they accuse you of manipulating them and then they continue to treat you as not even human.
It's two times now where I was triggered because a moderator or another redditor misunderstood my intentions and they turned to saying such unnecessarily cruel and abusive things and pushing you to believe your a bad person and having suicidal thoughts.
Either I'm just hyper vigilant and stupid and bad, or people on Reddit are just completely depraved and apathetic.",ptsd

"Just got diagnosed  Hello, I have just joined the sub because today my therapist told me she believes I have ptsd from am abusive relationship I experienced for a few years. It was never physical really just emotional or a few pushes here and there. He cheated on me repetitively without my knowing and sexually assaulted me multiple times. Distributed the videos of us together when I was underage and put me in dangerous situations as well as comparing me to other women and calling me names repetitively. He also kicked me out in nothing but a jumper and left me freezing and stuff like this. Also ridiculed my mental illnesses. I don't want to go to far into it as it's hard enough talking about it let alone bringing up the memories.

"Insurer won't send me a psychiatrist's report.  Context: over a year ago, an insurer agreed to cover a physical injury but denied any mental injury (despite 3 psychiatrists confirming PTSD). 

Recently, the insurer organised for me to have an independent medical assessment, with another psychiatrist (a 4th).

My insurer then accepted my mental health claim, citing the psychiatrist's report (without providing a copy). 

Then, radio silence. Nothing for weeks. 
Usually, my GP or therapist would be in touch. 

After some time, not hearing anything further, I contact my GP. I figured they were sent a copy at least. 
They say 'I've haven't heard of any report and it's been 6 weeks!' 

So I contact the insurer requesting a copy is sent to my GP, therapist, and myself. 
They ask who my GP and therapist are (they absolutely know who they are -they're paying games). 

I tell them anyway. 

They respond by saying that they'll send it to my GP. 

They won't send the copy to me, though.

Before I start I am a teenage boy so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm reacting in what many would call a childish manner. 

Tuesday night I got into a fight at a football match, it was with a person I know from school and I completely deserved it, I was being a dick really and got what I had coming. I use the word ‚Äòfight‚Äô lightly because I‚Äôm not very big for my age and would never purposely get into a fist fight with anyone because it‚Äôs not who I am and I would never win.

I am so stunned by what is happening I‚Äôm not defending myself or anything and I‚Äôm lucky he either hasn‚Äôt hit very hard or it‚Äôs just my adrenaline because I don‚Äôt really feel the shots and thank goodness there‚Äôs no serious damage apart from my lip is now inflamed.

I got home and broke down into tears (bad I know üôà) I was so upset with myself that I had put myself in that situation and just felt as if I had screwed everything up.
I decided to apologise to the kid over text and it was all good he apologised for punching me.
I slept fine Tuesday night but it was probably because I was so tired from all that had gone on.

Today has been the worst, it‚Äôs all I can think about. What will happen at school? (Nothing most likely because we are fine) *I have a week off for people wondering* So I know Sunday I won‚Äôt get a wink of sleep.
The event just keeps on replaying in my head continuously, when I‚Äôm doing daily things. My parents know about it and they told me off last night but today they seem worried about me my mum kept asking if I was ok after all that had happened and obviously I said yes.
The truth is it isn‚Äôt, there‚Äôs a horrible feeling in my stomach every second as I feel I‚Äôve let everyone down and made a bad image of myself.

I decided to go to bed early tonight to try and clear my head a bit however I‚Äôve been trying to get to sleep for hours now but I can‚Äôt because this fight keeps replaying in my head.

"Tics while eating after traumatic event? I don‚Äôt know if this truly fits here, so feel free to redirect me if necessary. [TW: suicide (graphic maybe?), disordered eating (not eating disorder)] 






So a couple of years back in 2020 I saw a man shoot himself online. I barely remember what it looked like and Kind of forgot I saw it so I guess my brain is pushing it away as much as it can, which I‚Äôm glad about. After that I had nervous ticks making my neck cramp up multiple times in a minute, whenever I thought of it. On that same day I tried to eat a food I enjoyed and started having these tics again, signaling me to stop eating. I ignored it, because I was hungry and was physically sick after for at least 30 minutes. This then repeated multiple times. Over the while the random tics have stopped and only joined up when I feel uncomfortable due to weird sensations or in the eating situations when it decides I should not eat anymore. Now this is really annoying, because often I barely ate a few bites and am still hungry, but know I can‚Äôt eat more or else I‚Äôll be sick. 
Now I was wondering, is there really a connection to the two things? It definitely correlated at the start, but could it still be the same reason nowadays? I do stim after because of the uncomfortable sensation it gives and I have autism and adhd as well.

"I (22F) have an issue that I can‚Äôt seem to share with my therapists. My earliest memory is from when I was around 3 or 4 years old. I can recall it as vividly as if it were yesterday, and it unsettles me. During a summer vacation with my family, I remember going to take a nap with my mother after we came back from the sea. Under the covers, I took off my clothes and remember secretly touching myself. The only thing I knew was that it wasn‚Äôt the first time I had done it. 

When I was alone at home as a child, I would sometimes undress in front of the mirror and touch myself, not even realizing it was a sexual act, because I didn‚Äôt learn what sexuality was until I started third grade. I remember feeling a particular satisfaction from doing it secretly.

Later on, I discovered p0rnography, and it changed my life. The unrealistic body images and portrayals of sex gradually disconnected me from real life. Now, I hate my body and don‚Äôt have a single day where I feel adequate.

For years, every time I‚Äôm alone (even in my first job), I end up touching myself and wanting more and more. But because I hate my body, I don‚Äôt have the courage to enter into a relationship with someone else (this may be the only advantage protecting me from doing things I might regret).

At first, I thought I might be hypersexual. But it didn‚Äôt seem reasonable since it might be related to trauma. When I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 at the age of 20, I started to think it could be related to that (my hypersexuality)

Still, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs normal for a 3-4 year old to do something like this. Maybe it is, and maybe it‚Äôs something normal, but because I can‚Äôt share it with anyone, I can‚Äôt help but feel scared.

Last year, my sister, who is ten years older than me, confesse.d that someone in our family abused her when she was very young. But she didn‚Äôt want to share the details or reveal who it was. This scares me even more, and I can‚Äôt help but wonder if there might be things from my childhood that I‚Äôve forgotten.

I hate discussing it with others‚Äîso much so that some people even assume I‚Äôm asexual. My family thinks I‚Äôm disgusted by sexuality and that I would never be with anyone. But I am far from being that way.

I can‚Äôt share this experience with my therapists because, as I said, I hate discussing sexuality with others.

Later in adulthood I started to doubt myself and got psychoses, which caused me to show completely different behavior, which I also saw in others. I started to behave like a little girl, out of fear that I would hurt someone, because I heard from certain people in the past that I was terrible. I suddenly became dependent on others, I sought a lot of attention and contact from others. My psychologist said that I have an attachment disorder.

"I just got recently diagnosed, now a lot of really random things make sense. Hi. I just got recently diagnosed with ptsd. I'm 17f and I am shocked. I didn't think I have ptsd, but I just realized I have a lot of the symptoms such as:
‚Ä¢when I zone out I remember traumatic events from throught my life, I'll regain awareness and it will slow down but I zone out a lot

‚Ä¢I get startled really really easily, I will gasp most of the time but sometimes I full on scream and I flinch really hard from it, unnecessarily hard

‚Ä¢sometimes I just wanna really avoid things. Crucial things that I need.

An example of that is school, ever since kindergarten I've been bullied physically, verbally, and emotionally. I've had some terrible things happen to me at school and the adults don't care so why even be there if it's gonna make me all awful? One of the worst things that happened was a kid pulling a knife on me, it was a light silver dagger with a black handle. The kid never got expelled only suspended.

I will avoid the skatepark too, it's really disappointing because it's one of my favorite places, I've been physically assaulted on multiple occasions there. Adults don't give a shit. They REALLY don't.

"i might have been sa as a child but i don't know for sure  hi, 

so couple nights ago i was hanging out with my friend and we were reliving a time i got drunk and they showed up to take care of me. they said that at one point i started yelling at them not to touch me or do anything to me and that i seemed really scared that they would. i trust this person with my life and know they would never ever hurt me. it really weirded me out to imagine myself behaving that way towards them, even though i was drunk. i don't have any memory of this of course, but as they were telling me how concerning it was to see that behavior, i had this weird flashback/memory thing with this guy i used to know as a kid.

 for context, i was like 4 or 5, maybe 6, and i remember this boy who was several years older than me giving me really uneasy feelings as a kid. to this day, whenever i hear his name or randomly remember his family, i get this feeling of dread. that night, as i was talking to my friend, i had this sudden memory (i think) of me being alone with him and him telling me to do some inappropriate things and then i remember a closed door. that's it. i don't remember anything else except having a hopeless and scared feeling afterwards. my friend asked if i was ok and i explained to them what was happening. they were asking questions and i kept saying it felt like i was remembering something but i didn't know for sure. they started freaking out and i started freaking out. it was like we were both finding out i might have been violated when i was a child together. 

after that happened, i started thinking back to my life around that age. i remember my parents saying i used to have severe night terrors when i was little and i would wake up screaming. i also became really sexual and easily aroused at this age. i wasn't having sex, but i was pleasuring myself once or twice a day until i was around 8 or 9. i also would have frequent dreams as a kid about being touched or undressed by strangers all the time. sometimes i would wake myself up masturbating in my sleep. i also remember being really paranoid about locked doors and bathrooms growing up. if i had a play date at a friends house, using their bathroom always made me feel on edge. i felt uneasy around most males growing up, especially my brother's friends, and would avoid being alone with them at any cost. i don't know if i was just trying to be appropriate or if it was me trying to protect myself from something happening again. i still feel wary around most men, but i can't tell if it's just a natural response as an adult woman who is familiar with the potential threat of men, or if i've been carrying a specific fear since i was a kid. the only other symptoms i still experience are the feelings regarding bathrooms and locks. sometimes i'll still have similar dreams as i did back then, but now that i'm older they're uncommon. however, now i'll have dreams about being sex trafficked or kidnapped; occasionally realistic-feeling dreams of just sex. i don't know if it's relevant, but i'm a virgin and i've never watched porn. 

all of these things are coming back now and i don't know if it's because something happened back then or if i imagined it. the past couple days have been me going back and forth between being convinced something happened to me as a child, and then thinking i just imagined the whole thing. i'm already in therapy after experiencing weird triggers and emotional flashbacks as a result from a relationship i ended this year. i've never had any of those symptoms for physical trauma, because as far as i knew i didn't have any until a few nights ago. i have no idea what's happening. i don't know what to do or what's real anymore. has anyone experienced something similar?  what did you do about it? thank you for taking the time to read this i will appreciate any insight.

when i would vent about my sexual trauma or just discussing other things with her, sometimes she would tell me about her sex life with her husband, telling me stuff about toys and kinks, all whilst i was in a vulnerable state after being sa'd. that stuff was normalised to me at the time, so i would engage in the conversations whenever they happened. she never touched me in any way that was sexual, just giving me really tight hugs and sometimes playing with my hair + other casual things. the only thing i could think of that could mean anything sexual was her nudging me when she made innuendos about her having sex with her husband.


she was the one that knew first when i had an issue, or in my school's eyes, being a troublemaker (literally having panic attacks w no support). none of the teachers were considerate when it came to this, that specific teacher questionably being one of them. she was dragging me to a quieter place when i was having a panic attack and physically holding onto me, and i begged her and another teacher not to touch me because of how overwhelming everything was, and so she helped this other teacher basically push me down the stairs and telling me i was a disturbance to literally everyone around me and threatening to call my parents. that same day, i was left in a room with her and other kids and i wasn't allowed to eat anything during lunch. she didn't acknowledge me whatsoever until i apologised

whenever something bad between us happened, i would always be the one apologising and basically begging for forgiveness whilst she gave me the cold shoulder and the silent treatment. i really don't know if this is anything severe and i need to tell my parents, or if im just overreacting about everything. please help, anyone, be as honest as you need to",ptsd
"Help with PTSD... Is there any way to get help for PTSD if you have no health insurance and some savings?  I am willing to pay a reasonable rate.  I am a former special ed teacher who needs help for being assaulted on multiple occasions.  I feel so bad for even saying it, but I am terrified of the special needs population now.  :(

I quit the job, so that's why I don't have insurance.  Unfortunately, I didn't do anything with documenting for worker's comp.  I was just so glad to get out of there.  It's also been about a year, so definitely too late to pursue it.  I have some savings, but I am living on it, and I can't spend a lot on medical needs right now.

"Was this a flashback? Difference b/w flashbacks and emotional flashbacks? TW: references to physical/emotional abuse 

For context, my parents divorced when I was five. It was incredibly messy. They would fight constantly, sometimes in front of me, and sometimes it would escalate to where they would throw objects around the house or at each other. My mom and stepdad have been married for over a decade now with a very healthy marriage.

I have a handful of moments like these:

I was recently able to recall a memory of my bio dad pinning me down, holding his hand over my mouth, and spanking me with a belt when I was about 4 or 5 for crying. When I tried to verbalize this to my stepdad, I suddenly felt hot all over. I felt choked up, like I couldn‚Äôt talk or breathe well, and my heart was pounding so hard my stepdad told me he could feel it while I sat leaning on him. 

My parents had an argument sometime last year. My mom and my stepdad are happily married. He‚Äôs safe and he loves me very very much. But that day when I heard them arguing, it felt like I was on fire. I was shaking, felt like I had a hot flash, my stomach churned, and while they wouldn‚Äôt notice, I drove to somewhere secluded and sobbed in my car for 15 minutes straight. I turned off my location and was afraid to reach out to anyone, and the only thought on my mind was that I was alone and that I had to run away. Things weren‚Äôt safe anymore, and I was all on my own.

Are these flashbacks? I was under the impression a flashback meant a literal reexperiencing of an event, sensory-wise. Or can it also happen without recalling a specific memory? When people say they reexperience an event, do they mean externally, or in their mind‚Äôs eye? What exactly is the difference between being triggered and experiencing a flashback, and how would you go about recognizing them?",ptsd

i told her how she hurt me over the years. she said she knows and she‚Äôs sorry and didn‚Äôt truly take accountability. she kept trying to turn it on me but also weirdly accepted how she‚Äôs hurt me? she said she‚Äôs sorry for what she‚Äôs done and i think she meant it, but again, this is so confusing for me. she hasn‚Äôt hit me in years, but her mental abuse has been consistent. now she‚Äôs being really nice and still criticizing me, but i don‚Äôt think she realizes she‚Äôs criticizing. i feel she thinks she‚Äôs giving good advice. i don‚Äôt know. is my trauma supposed to be fixed now? am i supposed to feel better? i feel like im supposed to be happy now. but not sure how to feel. i don‚Äôt know how long this will last, but ive always hoped for a better relationship with her. as soon as i gave up on that, (was actually going to go no contact) she apologized, so i have no idea what to think now. i do love her and maybe this time it will be better, but i was just wondering if anyone has advice with this?

"I think I need help.... I met with a PWP last week, for a mental health assessment. She shared that she thought I might need more intensive support than what she could offer due to symptoms of PTSD. I had never considered that I might have PTSD and now I feel even more hopeless. I have been unable to overcome depression since 2017. PTSD just feels so insurmountable. I'm worried I'll be stuck like this forever and I don't think I can bare it. Since Friday, I have been feeling like I don't want to be here. Tonight I have spent the evening browsing Mind and Samaritans, googling 'feeling suicidal,' and even the risks of failure. I'm scared of dying..... But terrified of being alive. I text my friend to say that I miss her (she lives abroad) and she didn't reply. I think this has made me realise that I have no one. The PWP asked for any emergency contact and I told her I didn't have anyone, partly out of fear of her telling someone about what I shared and partly because it is true.

My town was famous for hosting a 3 day food festival where hundreds of thousands of people would attend. In 2019 an attempted mass shooting took place on the final day which injured many and claimed the lives of 3 innocent people. 

I left a few minutes before it took place, I was nearby when I heard shots and a lot of sirens go off. Just before I left and chatted with a childhood friend and later on in the night I found out she was shot.

"Trauma therapy - how long will I feel like this for?  Tl;Dr: heavy dissociation after two sessions, haven't gone into graphic detail but still it's the first time talking in a serious setting about my past. Is this normal and how long does it stick around? 

So, I've been in therapy for 10+ years on and off, mainly crisis support and working through general mental health issues. This is the first time I'm confronting my traumas, and for context I am a CSA and child abuse survivor. 

I feel like I am ready, I want to be ready. I am in a safe place now, but I can't move forward without experiencing PTSD on some level daily. Hence, therapy. We have not touched anything too deeply but it's still more than I've ever talked about it outside of conversations with my partner, or drunkenly trauma dumping to someone who has similar expierences. I guess maybe the seriousness of the setting throws me off. 

I've only had two sessions, in fact. The dissociation feels like a lot more, but at the same time I can't remember what it's like to not have this feeling. I'm more clubsy, can't focus much... I do have other life stresses, so it might not be the therapy. Still, I'm wondering has anyone else experienced this? How long roughly did it last, or is this a sign that I need to stop? I really don't think I will get through therapy without experiencing this side of things so... Stopping doesn't feel like an option. I want this, it just kinda sucks as a side effect. ",ptsd
"is this abuse? (TW) For context: Me and my sister are both adults. We don't have jobs, my sister is attending college virtually. Since we've both become adults, we've been dealing with trying to get obvious adult things (I've been able to register to vote, my sister had to badger my mom about getting her a bank account).

Obviously, since *we are both adults* it is our responsibility to get things set up. Problem is, we're still freshly new adults (I'm 19, my sister's 18) and know barely anything about adult stuff (never were taught how to fucking cook btw, had to do it ourselves). My mom was willing to commit a federal crime by withholding my SSN (she *eventually* gave it to me after a political event appeared but not after me finding a disability resource website and thinking about calling them to *even get it*/me telling her SO many times). My parents have also been physically abusive and emotionally abusive so I've realized for a few years that they are abusive.

My question is, is blatantly disregarding me and my sister's concerns about having access to adult stuff abusive? Her response is mostly ""do it yourself"" in a condescending tone. She never offers to help guide us along, she never sends us stuff to look at, just. Do it yourself! You're old enough to know! She also straight up forebodes my sister to learn how to drive (only ""after college"") despite being at *driving age.*

The below is blocked just in case, if you wanna read it just tap it.

Base idea of what Loyd experiences: >!In this Apocalyptic land, he sees this dog, who he used to have back when the world wasnt mostly zombified (I would say: zombies dont play a huge part in this story, but they are there and can cause issues).!< >!He was a sniper (dunno what branch of military yet), although he hallucinates about his dog being around still, being an ESA (and depending on how he's doing), he's still got killer good aim.!< >!He has present day hallucinations that can get worse and throw him off mission... some might say he's crazy even.!< He is sorta an introvert, he's actually very soft and shy (or at least thats how I drew him).

Despite this being fiction, I want him to be a bit more accurate to having ptsd, so his plot can definitely change, but that was a base idea of him rn. I want the readers to feel bad for him, love him, and also feel for those who actually do go through ptsd.

I don‚Äôt know what to say. The first month after the incident I didn‚Äôt feel alive. The 6 months after I spent every day thinking about it.

I was completely triggered and realised there were things I needed to work on when I was stalked and felt as if no time had passed 2 years after.

"FORGIVING Has anyone forgiven the person who assaulted them?? I was physically assaulted by my great-uncle six months ago and I haven't felt the same since. The way I was treated after the assault led me to jumping down a gorge that day, I was lucky I didn't have any injuries thanks to how lush the vegetation was. The shame and guilt that consumed me from the point on feels unbearable and I feel so isolated, the frustration building from being unable to move on from it. I've always struggled with depression throughout my adolescent years but even then I never physically harmed myself, now tho, I find the thought of slitting my wrist comforting, almost cathartic. There's also this unspoken but very present pressure from my family for me to forgive him but how can I? His actions have caused me tremendous anguish and yet I am expected to give grace to a man who couldn't even acknowledge what he did was wrong. My family has brushed this matter under the rug but something vicious in me wants to dig that wound deep and raw, until the blood touches my elbow, I want them to see how fucked up I am because I'm drowning. I can't persue my goals because even the memory of his shadow haunts me and it's suffocating. I cannot find it within myself to forgive him yet and even if I do, he's lost his place in my life. I am truly at a lost in this period of my life.",ptsd
"Would you consider these to be red flags when seeing a PTSD/trauma-focused therapist? Should I switch? Hi everyone. First-time joiner, and a long-time PTSD have-r. TLDR: I have PTSD from childhood trauma I had as a kid from heavy bullying and other unfortunate things that happened. After having a neuro/psych evaluation recently, it's been made official that I have PTSD, along with depression, anxiety, and inattentive ADHD. The doctor who did the neuro/psych evaluation recommended a local facility down the street and I made an appointment with a specific therapist since he was the soonest available one.

Here's where the potential red flags come into play:

* I came in, no one was at the front desk, so I sat down and waited. A few minutes passed by and he came out of his office room (he wasn't seeing anyone). He was a little late but I disregarded it.
* I finally came into the room, and it seemed he wasn't prepared for my situation, so he had to log on to his work laptop, skim through my intake forms (didn't know about my neuro/psych report I sent the facility). And he finally sat down on his therapist chair. Not sure if it's just me, but if I were a therapist, I'd certainly want to prepare myself and read through forms/reports from my patient to know the situation at hand.
* He began asking me questions in typical therapist fashion which I welcome, but the kicker here is that I saw him almost nodding each time I would answer the questions! I think he also noticed that I noticed that he was fighting from falling asleep, but that's definitely not something I wanted to happen, intro meeting or not.

I scheduled an appointment to begin EMDR therapy next week with him, and I mentioned this to my wife and she said I should call to be changed to another therapist. I thought maybe I should give him one shot since he may not be a coffee drinker or something, but that's a little wild to me. I feel like I should switch to someone else, but I'm curious what your opinion is on the matter.

Thanks for your input in advance! I wish everyone the best of luck in your healing journey. üíú

"Magnesium supplement Let me start off with: I am a skeptic. I have a strong background in the physical sciences and tend to be even a little snooty about data and whatnot.

About a week ago, I started taking one 500mg pill with my nightly pills. That first morning felt like a miracle. 

I woke up and felt like I could get out of bed immediately with my alarm.

Morning brain fog was reduced to almost nothing.

Joint/muscle pain was minimal (i tend to sleep like a curled up dead spider, this is the norm for me)

My mood was elevated, maybe because of the points above.

I'm not telling you what to do, im not even giving medical advice so sue elsewhere. Anecdotally this has completely changed how my mornings and by extension my days have been going.

Is it possible to be traumatized by something that didn‚Äôt directly happen to you? My mom was shot by her abusive boyfriend in the face and she died February 2023. I didn‚Äôt have to identify her but I somehow had gotten ahold of the ring camera footage and I basically saw it and I went through a point of time where  was stuck watching it. My moms death ruined me in many ways.

"CPTSD finally out of denial, but I hate it  I (F 22) am finally acknowledging what I have but it feels too late. After college, I had to move back home to where the trauma happened and I get triggered constantly. I don't know what to do genuinely I am at a loss and feel like the universe is playing a cruel trick on me. During the last year of college, my Psychiatrist and therapist were making good progress, and around the end, my psych believed I had CPTSD unfortunately I changed insurance and was unable to fully address it. Since then I've moved back home and live in what feels like a house full of landmines.. It's horrible, I can't fully remember what happened to me but my childhood home and someone who lives in the house triggers these episodes constantly. I felt so much rage and fear for this entire summer, and I couldn't understand why. I am not a suicidal person but since moving back home and having episodes of this intensity I say things and do things completely out of character. I don't want to hurt myself or anything like that, but when they happen I am so scared. I have my first therapist appointment on new insurance, but I don't know if it'll help. I tried two different SSRIs and they made me feel worse. 

One thing that is really bothering me is that two people really close to me are taking SSRIs and they are helping them and every time I try and medicate myself it doesn't work or makes it worse. In fact, they are both taking the SSRIs I tried.  (one has major depression and the other has GAD). I am jealous of them. I am in pain and it feels like there's no way out. I have to be here and I can't get out. 

I try to be regimented, workout, self-care, job, etc. but I'm losing my battles lately. The only thing that I feel will ""fix"" me is moving out. Believe me, I've tried but I can't afford it. I am fighting as hard as I can to move out but nothing is working. I am not sure what to do, I am trying to tolerate things till the therapist's appointment.  I really did not belive that I had CPTSD, but after what has been happening to me I can't deny it. I am also horrified that I am this messed up, I dont feel like I deserve any compassion at all for how I behave. It is terrifying to me and the people who love me. I am scared to hurt them.

"I feel like I lost my childhood and I want it back.  Hi everyone. I just thought of venting about my feelings because whenever I try to talk to the people around me, I always get shutdown or told to ""move on."" I feel like I am burdening people with my own issues so, I just avoid talking about my feeling all together. 

My life as a child was quite tragic. I will not get into details for fear of triggering myself but all I can say for now is, I have been verbally, physically and emotionally abused as a child. My maternal family has put me through hell. My father walked out on me when I was four. It's the 20th year since I've seen him. 

Over the years, I have created this child-like persona because I am trying to hold on to what is left of my childhood. Now I'm a 24 year old woman with an identity crisis and every single day I feel like I am going to burst. I am so exhausted. Sometimes I wonder if I will spend the rest of my life brooding about the past.

"Seeking Advice on Completing Studies with CPTSD Hello everyone,

I have a question about CPTSD and trying to complete my academic studies. I wasn‚Äôt able to submit my master‚Äôs thesis, and now, four years later, I‚Äôm feeling determined to finish because I‚Äôm so close. However, my diagnosis leaves me unsure about whether I can manage to complete it.

I received the CPTSD diagnosis after I initially failed my thesis. To apply for accommodations, I need to describe how my CPTSD affects my studies. I‚Äôm looking for specific exceptions, like extended deadlines, more time, or flexibility on the number of attempts.

For me, making decisions, staying focused, and finishing tasks has always been difficult. When I study, I often feel lost‚Äîespecially since I work alone and lack structure in my life‚Äîwhich can lead to dissociation and anxiety. I get overwhelmed easily, and deadlines now feel nearly impossible to meet.

"I feel broken in body, mind, and soul  I just want to pour my heart out and share my story. But this is going to be graphic so please, only read if you're 18+ and if you are able to hear this stuff (domestic violence, SA, suicidal feelings, etc). Thanks...
.

.
.

So, I'm broken. I'm completely and utterly broken. All my life I've been used, abused, and hurt. It started when I was molested. I guess it turned on a light switch in my mind and made me both incredibly sadistic and incredibly masochistic at the same time. I was also hit two times as a kid and exposed to a lot of frightening situations. The damage was done fast. Fast forward to teenagehood and then I become hypersexual and start engaging in dangerous online behavior with older men. I wanted to replay the chaos I experienced as a child. And I developed severe mental health issues like BPD and major depression...I became hypersexual and I fell fast. I became suicidal and was hospitalized.

In my late teens, I was sexually assaulted violently by my ex. It was the first violent struggle of my life. I screamed and I kicked and I fought but to no avail. Nobody could help me.  I felt disgusting in my body. I felt violated and horrible. I fell into a deep depression.

Then I ended up in an abusive relationship..He called me names, so many names. And he beat me until my whole legs were covered with thick, dark bruises. I feel a sense of fear when I hear the sound of the belt. Nothing hurt more than the searing pain of the leather against my skin. It felt like it was being burned off. He also forced me to be a camgirl for money. I hated it. I tried, even on cam, and no one cared. There's still pictures of it online. If I didn't do the cam work, I would be beaten or called names. I felt like I couldn't leabe him...

But I did..

Only to fall into the hands of another abuser. He was mostly verbally abusive, but he coerced me by guilt tripping me into sex. He lamented that I didn't want to have sex with him, and he would cry. We got in an argument and I capitulated. I had sex with him and I grinned and beared it. I winced in pain and I felt beyond violated with what was happening to me. He knew I didn't want it..but he didn't stop. I left him...but it hurt. He was the last person I was with (in person) 

I tried to have normal relationships, but it's never worked out. The only people who want me are abusers. I feel broken, unable to escape from the cycle of abusive that I both love (because trauma feels safe) and hate (because I feel suicidal). I want to end my life because I don't want to be broken.

I don't want to fall into the hands of another abuser but that seems to be my whole life. I've forgiven everyone who hurt me and I wish them peace and good things but it hurts being broken. I'm so hypersexual that I spend several hours a day in fantasy, mostly very violent ones, and not taking care of myself. 

It hurts so much. 

I can't take this. I can't stop blaming myself. I feel like I deserve it 

Help me...please....I'm drowning. ",ptsd
"Blacked out and had an episode I think I just need to vent.  I was raped 5 years ago while I was passed out drunk.  In the last couple of years, I've made some progress and have been working hard in therapy to get through the trauma and it's been working a little.  I'm coming out of my shell a bit more lately and socializing more than ever, which has been nice.  But it's still a daily struggle.

I went to a halloweekend party at a friend's house with my partner and my friend R on Saturday night.  We had all been drinking, but I certainly wasn't expecting to get hammered, I just wanted to have some fun.  Another friend made some sangria for everyone, which was wayyyy stronger than anyone realized, including me.  I had 3(!) cups of it within the span of maybe 45 minutes and before I even realized it, I was incredibly drunk.  I remember standing on the porch with a piece of pizza and then nothing, just little flashes here and there.  I like to drink but the last time I got this drunk was when I was assaulted, so I'm not used to it.

Well, while I was blacked out, I guess that was a massive trigger to my body and I apparently had a MASSIVE ptsd episode.  According to my partner and friends, I passed out, then woke up on the couch and started freaking the fuck out.  My friend R was trying to console me while my partner called an uber and they took me home, where I apparently started full on screaming when they tried to touch me to help me up after falling (multiple times) or to take my shoes off or anything.  I woke up with absolutely no memory of this, just a horrible hangover, a banged up body, and the post-adrenaline exhaustion.

On top of this, someone at the party texted my partner privately.  She was asking my partner if my friend R ""kissing"" me while I was passed out was consensual or something she should tell me about.  My wife assured her that there were no kisses at all and that it was just the way he was angled, he was just trying to calm me down and reassure me everything was okay, and that he would never do something like that.  I believe my partner, I think, but Jesus Christ.  I have not been able to relax since any of this happened.  Idk if it's just the kind of emotional hangover from having such a massive episode or if it's me trying to work out how I feel about whatever happened with my friend R.  He was, according to my partner, incredibly good with helping me when we got home and did a lot to respect my boundaries in that state while also trying to help me feel better.  But the doubt that lingers is so incredibly hard to get over.

All this to say I will never trust my friends sangria again, I hate parties and I hate PTSD. ",ptsd

"My Therapist told Me about an Episode I had in Therapy and at School.  Hello,
I had therapy at school( a safe place) and we did some trauma work. From what my therapist told me that we did ten minutes of trauma work in total, we did 3 minutes of talking and butterfly tapping( of a surgery I had), 2 minutes of metronome, 2 minutes of another thing. All through it I was very dissociated. She told me that before we ended that she did a grounding exercise with me. I don‚Äôt know if I was very dissociatied after, but I was conscious for 1 second before I was dissociated again. From what I was told it was 30 minutes- 1 hour until I was found( my teacher thought I went down to the office, so that why it her so long to find me) from what I was told that i took me an hour to get out of dissociation and talking. I got out of dissociation but I couldn‚Äôt talk for a good while. And I realized after I came out of the dissociation that my teacher was there. In total 
my episode lasted 3 hours. 

My therapist has told me that I might have a dissociative disorder, she can diagnose me but I am getting a neurological testing done in the future. We talk about a lot of things so it‚Äôs sort of hard to ask her about dissociative disorders. She told me that the dissociative disorder could be with the PTSD or a stand alone diagnosis. I know of dissociative disorders, are there more dissociative disorders than I know of? I don‚Äôt remember any of this. Only that one second that I was conscious

"I'm anxious about today  I posted here not too long ago. My husband has PTSD and had a mental health crisis that has led to him having a court date. Today is his pre-trial date. I asked him this morning if he's talked to our heard from his public defender and he said he hasn't. We don't have court for about 3 hours and I'm already feeling anxiety creeping up on me.

I'm prepared for the worst and hoping for the best. The worst is he might have to spend 3 years in jail and pay $15k in fines. That's the maximum penalties for the things he's charged with. The best would be that they just chalk it up to a mental health crisis that he's getting help for and he doesn't get anything more from it than we've already been dealing with.

I know he's stressing and anxious too so I'm trying not to bug him with my thoughts and feelings but keeping it all to myself was too much so here I am, venting on Reddit. I don't know if this is the right subreddit for venting this stuff, but it's where I talked about it before so it just seemed fitting?

I'm just stressed out. I've never really been through this. The prosecutors office also said that they might subpoena me to testify but aren't there like spousal protections against that?

"I feel so alone  I‚Äôm safe and okay. I feel very alone every day simply bc idk anyone who went through what I did. No one gets it. I feel like I‚Äôve been forced to run a race against everyone else and my legs were cut off at the start, but everyone keeps asking me why I‚Äôm not having fun. I have no family. No friends beyond normal people who actually like me (I like them too) but I feel this gulf between me and all of them. They talk so easily of friends and family, tell stories about themselves as kids that don‚Äôt horrify others, and it‚Äôs not their fault. No one is to blame. Not my mom or dad or abusers. No one. These things happened to me for no reason and I bear scars I‚Äôve never seen anywhere else. It‚Äôs too late for lifelong friendships and I guess I‚Äôm okay with that.

"New to everything and still not sure if I‚Äôm going mad Hi all,

Very recently diagnosed with complex ptsd from sustained abuse from my parents. I was misdiagnosed for so many years and the painfully vivid memories where it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm back in that moment are driving me insane. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs normal to feel so crazy about the memories and being back in those moments but I just can‚Äôt seem to come back to the present moment as easily as I once did. 

There‚Äôs been a very specific memory that has been plaguing me for years which seems perfectly happy, probably the only one that is a ‚Äúnice‚Äù memory. For some reason, however, I can‚Äôt help but feel extremely on edge and uneasy whenever this specific memory comes up. I can‚Äôt tell you how or why but something feels unsafe about it. As soon as I think about it I‚Äôm fidgety and start scratching at my arms and hands. 

How can I get my mind off of it or any ways to help get me out of the cycle of reliving memories that just end up making me feel scared or worse?",ptsd
"Every day, I just count the hours until it's time to go to bed Being asleep isn't very fun because of nightmares, but being awake is worse because of triggers that I somehow seem to find everywhere, plus the expectation to perform, plus the constant thoughts that other people either don't want me around or are simply tolerating me. Everywhere I go, no matter what I do, I feel like the world would be better off without me. I go through the motions on autopilot but I have no motivation to do anything, not even read or go outside.

The other day, I came to work feeling kind of out of it, like I was physically there but I wasn't really there. In my half-zoned-out state, I didn't notice that I bled through my shirt until someone pointed it out to me. He pulled me aside and was like, ""What happened, who did this to you?"" I didn't know how to respond, so I just looked at him without saying anything. After a few moments of staring each other down, he asked me if I was the one who did that. I just laughed and said, ""Maybe. The better question is, what did I do to deserve an inquisition?"" but I've been too embarrassed to look him in the eye ever since.

"can ptsd be caused by a suicide attempt?  hi guys! 

to get straight to the point, i attempted suicide last year and it was a very horrific experience for not just me but for everyone else who had to see the aftermath 

i won‚Äôt get into the specifics of what i did or what others saw, but to paint a picture the aftermath looked like a crime scene. 

i find that i have flashbacks of the noise the attempt made, what i saw was happening to me, the screaming, and going to hospital shortly after. 

i noticed that whenever i bring this experience up, or just in general think back to it, it brings me to tears and my heart starts racing and it‚Äôs almost like i lose sight of what‚Äôs in front of me and i‚Äôm transported straight back to that night

"How to control what I say when I black out from flashbacks I have comolex ptsd (diagnosed by professional therapist 3 years ago I no longer have) because of an abusive relationship i am no longer in. I was single for two years and content


I started dating a wonderful person who we've discovered also has ptsd (undiagnosed) we trigger eachother. Its horrible. I remind her of her abusive parents and she reminds me of my abusive ex (but only when we're triggered)


we have 2 day long fights once a month on average. I get triggered and say something that triggers her and its just a stupid domino affect. We know we dont mean what we say when were in this state and I can deal with it but she cant.


She told me either I have to control what I say ""This relationship is horrible for me"" - for example, when im triggered and upset, or shes going to either 1. Kill herself or 2. have a heart attack. She doesnt want to leave but she fears she might for her life


Our ptsd outburts were getting better until she got in a car accident back in february. She broke her leg and has a buldging disc in her neck. She is always in extreme pain and needs cannabis for survival. I think this might be perpetuating some of this but I could be wrong

I support us financially and understand this isnt her fault. But we were only
together 6 months before this all happened. The only time we dont fight is when we're high 

I need help. Almost everyone I talk to tells me to leave her and im a saint. She isnt my responsibility etc. But if I do she will be homeless because she cannot work. She will actually kill herself. But now she will too if she stays with me. She has no family who can watch her


and I love her


if I can control myself when we have flashbacks we wont have problems. Maybe she can learn to control herself too


Please help me, I dont know what to do

"Just had the worst panic attack of my life  I was having ice cream with my family, I was already a bit anxious and had been thinking a lot about my trauma (fireworks) and they left me alone for a sec because they had to order their ice cream and we had our two dogs with us. Suddenly, a very loud car passed in front of me and that kind of triggered my fight-or-flight response but I was working on calming down, but then I smelled something like gun powder and something burning and I just burst into tears. I couldn't breath and was hyperventilating. Thankfully my cousin (a psychologist) helped me through it and brought me to the car. I felt incredibly helpless and like I was dying. What can I do to stop this? I've had panic attacks in the past but they've never been this bad and I hadn't really ever felt like I couldn't breathe because of my triggers.

It‚Äôs now about to be November and I haven‚Äôt really thought about the events this past month, but now I‚Äôm obsessed with them. I journal about them, I listen to songs that make me feel guilty and shameful about them, and I would even go as far as to say that I basically get off to my own trauma. I feel so conflicted. These were horrible things that happened to me, and they have wrecked my life. Weirdly enough though, now I find pleasure in thinking about them. The past few days I‚Äôve neglected my schoolwork because I‚Äôve been too hyper-fixated on this, but the difference is now it‚Äôs almost an enjoyable event for me in some weird fucked up way? Or maybe it‚Äôs a form of self harm, forcing myself to like what happened to me, while also letting it eat me up inside?

"C-PTSD: had a HORRIBLE year, was betrayed by a best friend and went through a hard period, but am determined to turn over a new leaf (includes a retelling of a specific event) **WARNING: THIS IS A LONG POST**

I grew up in a cult and have severe c-ptsd.

My childhood was full of physical violence, emotional abuse and gaslighting. Somehow, I still managed to finish both high school and college, got a job and moved away from home. I'm 25 y/o now.

I was always top of my class (an overachiever), but gave very little attention to my appearance (I had severe acne for 10+ years and just stopped trying to cover it up at some point). After college, I got rid of my acne and started putting effort into my appearance, but did it more to fit in than from genuine self-love.

When I was 24 'the year of doom' happened. I thought I had finally become a functioning member of society, but it turned out that I had gotten myself into three very bad relationships/situations:

\- I became best friends with the most unhinged woman I had ever met (but she hid her true self very well).

\- I was in my (second) romantic relationship with a man who mistreated me. (Hid his phone, talked with past flings, almost never did anything nice, let his friends disrespect me, constantly played me songs about men cheating on their girlfriends... But was the sweetest ray of sunshine when we had first met.)

\- I ended up working a job where the boss was a wuss and allowed my co-worker to put me down repeatedly. (And would then get extremely offended once I had decided to quit after a year.) They have had a problem with this particular individual for years (many people have quit because of her attitude, some even after a few days of being there), but have not fired her, as she knows more about the business than the boss himself.

After the incident with the 'best friend', though, I went through an episode of rage and self-hatred. I had first tried to commit suicide before I even started attending elementary school and was luckily unsuccessful. Then that need subsided. Until that 'year'. After that I tried again. **I'm absolutely not trying to say it was her 'fault' specifically, there were just too many things going wrong at the same time and this was just the proverbial 'cherry on top'. Had it not been this situation, it could have been anything else...**

**If you're interested, keep reading. Otherwise, please click away.**

**Here's the story (hopefully short enough without losing context):**

I had met my best friend in college. We were acquaintances for a long time, but became very close in the year after I finished school as she had kept inviting me out to events. She was the sweetest person ever. She not only introduced me to her entire friend circle, her fiancee, but to her entire family as well. In the entire year from the moment we started hanging out until her wedding she had NOT ONCE done ANYTHING that would rise suspicion. I did notice a possible mean streak once or twice, but we all slip up sometimes, so I just brushed it off.

I had never had a close friend, only people I went out to lunch with. The cult had taught me that hanging out with people outside our religion would take me away from God. By the time I met her, I had been an atheist for a few years already. But I knew that I had a problem with being too trusting. I kept my walls up with her and didn't wanna let her in too easily. I didn't overshare. I didn't self-deprecate. I just was. I thought I did everything 'right'. But she still turned around and hurt me once I had finally let her in. I think this is why I got so pissed afterwards.

So, after the 'honeymoon' year we had, she got married to her fiancee. She asked me to be her maid of honour. I was ECSTATIC as I truly loved her as a friend. I also felt proud of myself as I interpreted her request as me 'having made it' as a member of broader society. I was finally 'normal'. And despite my shitty relationship and job, I still had my wonderful friend who would always be there for me. She had at one point even said to me that 'she would always protect me and love me and that I was her soulmate'.

So yeah. Some time after the marriage, I'd finally had it with my boyfriend and I dumped him. I wish I had done so sooner, but he was my first 'real' relationship. (My first boyfriend had a severe porn addiction and had consequently become impotent because of it, which made the relationship very... hard to sustain.) She flipped completely once I was single - which was weird because I was also single when we first became friends. After the breakup she wanted to meet up with me to 'offer me a shoulder to cry on', but then just interrogated me the whole time.

What happened next all went down in a span of two months. She couldn't stop talking about different men lusting after her (her professor, acquaintances, random men on the street). When we were alone, she suddenly started acting as though she was single, always checking who was looking at her and twirling her hair. She also started making small, hurtful jabs at me and came up with very creative backhanded compliments. She implied that my ex-boyfriend secretly liked her, continuously repeated that 'it was obvious that my ex never loved me', tried to set me up with men she knew secretly had a thing for her, even tried to invite herself to a blind date her husband tried to arrange for me. She obsessed over how 'good' or 'bad' the guys I was getting to know were (i.e. their physical appearance, job etc - she wanted to know everything). She then even started insulting the size of my breasts. I had, understandably, decided to cut her off.

However, my new boyfriend (who she didn't know about for a long time) told me to talk it out with her like an adult and I agreed as I thought that I had nothing to lose. People close to me also told me that people sometimes have a crisis after they get married (especially if they get married young - she was just 22 y/o) and that she would probably get over it. I also didn't want to lose a (previously very good) friend if there was still a chance to mend things. Well, the talk did not go well. She was incredibly gracious at the time but (of course) deflected everything. Good old gaslighting. Then she became very cold towards me, but only when she knew we were alone/when we talked on the phone.

Soon after she and I had the 'talk', I had naively decided to give her a second chance and agreed to let her and her husband meet my new boyfriend. I suppose she really wanted to meet him as she had still been relatively nice up until the meeting. During the meeting she talked with a cutesy high-pitched voice and flirted with my boyfriend (in front of her husband) so aggressively that he had concluded by the end of the evening that the two were in an open marriage. At some point that evening the two of us were alone (the guys had left to get us something to eat) and she posed inappropriate questions about me and my new boyfriend's sex life. After I had diplomatically answered them she got annoyed and said that her boyfriend has an enormous penis and that she orgasms 6 to 7 times per round. She then clarified that she only told me that so that I 'would have realistic expectations for my sex life'. Talk about insecure.

After that meeting, I avoided her like the plague, deleted all my social media and decided to try and fade out of her life. I didn't want to make a dramatic exit, as I suspected that she may be a very vengeful person. But I had promised a mutual friend that I would come to a very casual birthday celebration of hers a month prior and I did not want to go back on my word. However, once I got there, the two women did a weird spiel talking about my boyfriend without letting me interject. I suspect they had made plans to do so beforehand, but even if they hadn't... my 'best friend' went 'off-script' either way. She literally couldn't hold herself back and said that my new boyfriend had a 'small dick'. The only person who even remotely tried to stand up for me was her husband. I stood up and left and blocked all of them immediately.

I thought that was the end, but two weeks later she suddenly started calling me from random numbers at ungodly times. I knew it was her, because who else would call at 8 AM on a weekday or on a weekend afternoon and then not leave a message if it was so important. But one fateful Sunday, my boyfriend picked up my phone, because he believes in always answering the phone no matter what. He didn't even recognize her by her voice but she immediately went and slid into his DMs after I had blocked that number too. In the DM she accused me of 'having used her for friendship until I got a boyfriend' and of me hurting her so severely that she NEVER wanted to have ANY kind of relationship with me ever again, but she reportedly still wanted to know 'why I had abandoned her'.

He poignantly told her that he was surprised that she had the guts to say that I was the bad friend and even more guts for writing to him after what she had said about his penis. She then started profusely 'apologizing' while also hammering home the point that I was the one who had 'misunderstood' her comment. But once he refused her proposition of another meeting, she flipped the script and said that she had actually never said that his penis was small and that I was the worst person she had ever met. That I would leave him too one day and that he would be sorry that he did not heed her warning.

My boyfriend then told me to maybe write to her one last time - to close the chapter, not for any other reason and I decided to do so. I tersely summarized the worst things she had said/done to me, but said that I still wish her all the best in her life. I also asked her to never contact me or my loved ones ever again. The reply I got was the most disgusting and hurtful attack on my being I had ever experienced. She said I am so rotten that she did not wish me well by any means. That I am 'intellectually impaired' for not understanding the things she had said and that she had NEVER insulted me once. She also got indignant as I had written in my message that I would rather have no friends than abusive ones and she tired her best to insult my very ability to be a good friend to anyone... I don't care to go back and re-read exactly what she had written, because I had managed to forget some of it and will hopefully someday forget it all.

That was the end of the 'fairytale' friendship. After a year of love bombing, the relationship was irreparably destroyed in two months. However, she has kept the social media post she had once made for my birthday on Instagram and Facebook, acting as though we had never fallen out. In that post she, ironically, calls me 'the best person in the world'.

**Fin.**

That was my intention when I had first posted it on Reddit, but it got so bombarded by negative comments that I removed it for my own peace of mind.

"romantic trauma ruining my relationship  romantic trauma causing issues 

so for some context, im in a relationship with my fianc√© of 3 years we‚Äôre polyamorous and recently started seeing (not dating) this person, i‚Äôm not looking for advice or criticism on polyamory, that‚Äôs not the issue here.

so, to make a long story short my past two relationships before my current fianc√© was absolutely traumatic, i have cptsd and those two relationships are major trigger points for me. i really struggle with portraying romantic affection or affection in general due to it, i only recently managed to start actually being romantically affectionate to my fianc√© due to it. 

anyways, onto the problem, both me and my fianc√© are developing a bit of a crush on this person but there‚Äôs an issue. i‚Äôm jealous- not jealous because of my partner being romantic and stuff with another person, i‚Äôm jealous because i can‚Äôt do the same with the person? 

i can‚Äôt be romantic with them at all due to my romantic trauma, it makes me really uncomfortable and to a degree disgusted but at the same time i crave affection and the same things that my partner and our third person is showing eachother.

i like both of them so much and want to be able to show affection and be romantic to them even if just a little bit i really don‚Äôt know what to do in this situation?

the tension it‚Äôs causing me personally keeps causing me to subconsciously find stupid minor things to get angry with and i keep causing issues with the third person and stupid arguments. i really need advice on what to do to get over this romantic trauma and stop being so uncomfortable and making myself upset

"Reconsidering medication Recently I've have several large triggers that have disrupted my ability to get through daily tasks and take care of myself. I'm now re-experiencing previous traumas that haven't bothered me very much for years up until now. 

I'm currently in therapy with someone that I feel I've made a lot of progress with up until this point, she works with somatic and energy medicine, very big on how trauma is stored in the body, and we do some IFS/parts work. 

All that being said, the parts work and energy medicine is not getting me through the worst of my anxiety anymore. Previously, it would help stave off panic and anxiety attacks, but now I'm drowning. 

I had an old prescription of Klonopin (from around 4 years ago) that I caved and took last night, and it's the first genuine relief I've had from being constantly triggered in over a month. It's made me start to consider if I should be getting back on an as needed anxiety medication. I've previously been on a variety of different medications and Klonopin was the only one that offer real benefits. However, before all this I had been considering getting back on ADHD medication as well, and I worry one would interfere with the other. 

All this to say, I'm thinking about trying to get back on Klonopin, but worry about how it may impact the progress I've made without medication, as well as if it would interfere with ADHD meds.

"Medication Dependency & Side Effects  I was just prescribed Buspirone 10mg for sexual dysfunction due to antipsychotic medications. I started about a week ago and the past few days I haven't been able to remember anything it seems. I've been forgetting what I'm doing. I forgot if I took my meds this morning. I forget what I'm typing and saying. I'm calling my psychiatrist tomorrow to see if I should stop but then I'd need to find another medication for libido. I have C-PTSD due to sexual trauma and I'm on so many medications I just have no libido. It's seriously affecting my relationship. THE PILLS I'M DEPENDENT ON DID THIS!

I'm also already on Sertraline 100mg and other medications that affect serotonin. I'm worried about serotonin syndrome.

I'm on Clonazepam .5mg up to 3x daily, Gabapentin 100mg in the morning and 300mg at night, Ziprasidone 160mg daily, Vyvanse 50mg, Thorazine 30mg, and Clonidine .1mg daily. There's so many different drug classes and I have no idea how they each affect serotonin. I'm really concerned about what all this stuff is doing to my brain and body. 

I'm well aware I'm on too many meds. But, I honestly don't know what to do. Believe it or not, my psychiatrist and I have been working on trimming this list down and decreasing doses and the list is smaller than it used to be. But, currently, I don't feel like I can come off anything else. I've done ECT (electro convulsion therapy) 2x to try and relieve my symptoms and it helped A LOT! It got rid of my suicidal ideations. But, I'm still a wreck. 

I've really tried to simplify my regimen but even with therapy I don't feel comfortable decreasing any meds at this time. I HATE that I'm so dependent on them!

I'm so frustrated üòû there have been times when I couldn't afford my meds and I had scary, awful withdrawals. I'm officially an addict.

I can't even get pregnant right now because I'd have to come off my meds and there's just no way. I'm seriously dependent on these psych drugs/benzo and I hate it. I'm worried I'm going to develop dementia early because of this. I HATE PSYCH PILLS!

"The difference between feeling aroused and feeling anxious  So I need some advice maybe some input here can help me. A lot of my trauma stems from SA and before my current relationship I never had a positive experience with being intimate. 
I am however in a healthy relationship for 6 years already and built a lot of trust and my partner and I are sometimes intimate.

Honestly I‚Äôm starting to dissociate and can‚Äôt even entirely remember what I was going on about in particular I mean I know but I don‚Äôt know why I was talking about that in specific. I still need to make breakfast. I‚Äôm just so tired. I‚Äôm just so so tired. It‚Äôs hard to have ptsd. I wish people understood it‚Äôs not just from war.

"I had a SA repressed memory come back after waking up from Anesthesia  It's difficult to start this off without sounding outlandish or weird but the impacts of this repressed memory coming back after waking from general anesthesia has completely altered my reality. It's been difficult to discuss openly since nobody has openly expressed something happening like this. I've generally been known as an engima in the health field but I feel so alone in all of this and a part of me is in continuous denial. This memory was something completely random as I was never aware of having being SAed. I've had my suspicions based off certain elements such having a weird anxiety when people go near my back area. So I was completely put off guard with this new found information.

To give some context without being too personal, I am a 22/F was having a procedure called a cystocopy conducted that involves the inseration of a small tube up urethra in order to examine the bladder. Due to the invasive nature of this surgery the doctor had decided to put me to sleep while doing the procedure. As someone who's done a few other procedures in the past, I've never had any issues with general anesthesia and wake up from it in a great mood. These other surgeries were not in the private areas however, which I believe may provide some additional context. 

After the surgery was conducted, I had woken up, felt the pain in the gential area and instantly had a memory of being being violently SAed. It was a very quick glimpse of this memory before my brain shut it down as quickly as it appeared (I saw a quick glimpse before It was instantly hidden). Now....while feeling the pain of the procedure and having the memory occur, a series of other physical stimulus started to occur which sent me spiraling all in the matter of seconds.

 I want to make a note that when I look back to this occurrence it felt as though every response was subconscious.

Anyways, after feeling the pain, seeing the memory, I noticed I was unclothed and the thought of ""not again, not again, not again"" was surging through my head. Then I noticed the liquid that was all over my body (water from cleaning) I remember saying ""who did this to me?!?!"" And proceeded to look down to see my thighs covered in yellow stains (numbing agent) thinking I had been marked from the assault. Essentially I was reliving and feeling everything that had happened to me within the memory.

After all of these things had occurred (which all happened in a matter of less than 2 minutes) I tried to physically remove myself from the bed and head to the bathroom. A part of me was trying to flee (fight or flight) and the thought was I was now tampered with and needed to clean myself in order to purify. As I gripped the handles, while swinging side to side because I was still high, a nurse ran over to me confused as to why I was trying to get out of my bed. I was of course silent and told the nurse repeatedly ""I NEED TO GO TO THE WASHROOM."" The nurse sadly was dismissive of my request and tried to make me urinate in a pan. I kept repeating to her that I needed to go to the bathroom, in which she reluctantly had moved the bed and navigated me in front of the washroom, where I proceeded to continue with my inner turmoil. 

IThese emotions and the reliving of this trauma was ongoing for over 3 hours.I ended up shaking/trembling subconsciously the entire time. I didn't know it was that long until I was notified by the nurse in the ER I was in recovery for that long. I even remember the doctor trying to speak to me but I was unresponsive and another nurse coming up to me to ask if I was alright since I was in COMPLETE distress. It has been impacting my ability to live and my therapist believes I've developed severe PTSD since it completely altered all elements of my life. I am recovering slightly but the constant thought of it being a fake memory plagues me and the constant anxiety formulated after experiencing this has impacted my ability to function. I don't know what to do but I just don't want to feel alone anymore. It's hard to discuss since nobody understands it so I decided to turn here. Any thoughts are welcome.",ptsd
"had to help save my grandmas life (TW: hospitals, medical emergencies) I‚Äôve lived with her since I was 11, she‚Äôs like a mother to me. She took too much medicine and passed out and stopped breathing. I had already taken my night meds so I was very out of it. I already have a c-ptsd diagnosis from my parents and some other childhood experiences, but I think this was genuinely traumatic for me.

I had to help her breathe, and call 911 and help her since she was partially seizing. Her face was purple and blue. I haven‚Äôt gotten the image out of my head since.

I just turned 18, and I‚Äôve never had to experience this before. They asked me all these questions and I was so confused and lost. 

All my neighbors were outside and saw us and me sobbing. It feels dumb to be more affected by this than her, since she feels much better now after some help in the hospital. 

My bio mom, who I do love but she just has issues and isn‚Äôt fit to parent me, showed up and just fell asleep immediately and then left. I was up for over 48 hours straight. 

Today I feel so foggy, almost high. Like my brain isn‚Äôt here. People are saying I‚Äôm talking different, my stutter is worse. I haven‚Äôt showered since and I can‚Äôt bring myself to eat. I just have no appetite. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. I don‚Äôt want her to know since she already feels bad about it, and it‚Äôs not her fault. 

I call my therapist today and we have an emergency session in two days since she‚Äôs booked. I almost ruined my 17 month clean streak too. It feels like I have a curse.",ptsd
"Fragmented memories, anyone have the same?  So I‚Äôm currently processing, it‚Äôs going well, people recognise that I‚Äôm doing much better. But, I keep getting fragmented memories, cutting through my progress.

I just read that the hippocampus is shrunk by 8% with PTSD, which causes weak encoding. I wonder how I can heal this? Or, if, I even can.

The memories, flashbacks I‚Äôm having, do not represent my progress. They actually impede it. I‚Äôm very patient and I‚Äôm letting myself go through this, but is there an actual end? ",ptsd
"Mum told me ‚ÄòI‚Äôll tell you if your flashbacks are real or not‚Äô This happened the other day. I told her that my therapist mentioned my body is ‚Äòforcing me to process‚Äô my childhood trauma. Because of this, I‚Äôve been having flashbacks or kind of visions/physical sensations 20 years after the event. Long story short police were involved and they never found out if anything actually did happen to me because I was so young and wouldn‚Äôt talk about it. I still don‚Äôt know if anything happened to me, and so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just overreacting. My therapist said it doesn‚Äôt matter if the flashbacks are real or not, the fact is I‚Äôm having intense reactions to them, and to deal with how to cope. I reiterated this to my mum, who then told me that because she was an adult during the time and remembered it all that I can come to her with these flashbacks (and she doesn‚Äôt mind if they‚Äôre really uncomfortable to talk about) and she can say whether it happened to me or not. I find this weird, as one of the reasons she started drinking for most of my life is that for 4 years she never knew what was happening to my sister at the time, and so she blamed herself for it. I find it a bit rich that she now knows everything and can discern whether something happened to me or not. Anyway I dunno I might be overreacting, I know she meant well‚Ä¶

"I don't understand/relate to my diagnosis. Any resources to help?  I was originally diagnosed with PTSD in 2019. I kind of related back then but I felt like I have gotten better than I didn't qualify for the dx anymore. I got rediagnosed last Wednesday. 

I have multiple instances of abuse and SA as a child/teen. So I get why they say I have PTSD but I don't understand the disorder that much I feel. Looking straight at the diagnostic criteria I don't relate to all the criteria.

Is there anyone that can help me understand more? Any resources out there? I may just not know how it actually affects me since I have so many other diagnoses. To clarify I'm not asking if I'm misdiagnosed or not, just for a better understanding of the disorder.

"Cutting off family 
Cut off dad not sure how to feel.

Don't really know where to start, abused by mother and father as a child, physical, emotional, whatever it happened. Just lost my job due to restructuring and I am stressed as hell, but my mothers gone and my dad on his way out, I have a 14 year old sister. ( all this just for context ) 

But space created room for our relationship to be okayish with me and my dad, unfortunately memories resurfaced recently that has made that allot harder. My whole life I have been invalidated in my feelings being told it was just discipline and I was a difficult child, he has never apologized seriously always in a manner in which he truly doesn't care. I've got PTSD and BPD diagnosed at the current moment with the additional depression and anxiety mixed in.

Now to get to tonight:

Essentially I get a call from him typically an every 2 week event and he starts speaking on mental health as he has recently gone through a near death experience and (he is also now super religious)  suddenly believes you can have mental health problems, he speaks on how my mother gave me mine and I correct him saying that both were very much involved. He then switches to how its my fault that I turned out how I did, that I feel angry all the time and am not exactly a joy to be around 24/7. He then asks for examples I give them, things like how he grabbed me by the throat and pushed me against the wall and screamed in my face while I complained I could not breathe, or him attempting to break my arm because he felt disrespected (in front of family members who are apart of this cutoff) Or him kicking down my door because he was angry at me and couldn't open it correctly thinking it was locked.

At this point he began to say he has no regrets and is done apologizing for the past, I mentioned he never apologized seriously once. (Not sure it would matter tbh) He claimed it was discipline and mentioned I was a smartass and difficult child, I then brought up my sister whom has not had to experience this at more than 30% to my knowledge, and she is just like me because she spent most of the time with me, he claimed its different (thank god it is because if she had to suffer as well I'd have lost it).

But then after I said ask anyone outside the family what it sounds like to them and see what they say, at that point he said I am done with this you can choose to make yourself suffer have a goodnight.

Not my finest moment I just said ""get cancer"" and hung up.

At this point I've begun separating myself from social media with them and cutting off all lines of communication with that side other than my sister who completely understands why I am doing this.

I cut off my mom as a child and it was easy, haunted me later on like years later. But why does cutting him off feel so wrong like I am making a mistake even though all he brings me is anger every time he talks to me he says he is gonna die with no regrets, which I know its wrong but it irks the hell out of me.

I haven't ever felt validated or like what I went through was truly as bad as it felt, every day walking on thin ice hoping to not piss him off for something so small. I still to this moment am wondering if I did the right thing and don't know where to go from here, what if they try to contact me? What if he does end up passing? Do I show up for my sister or save my mental? 

May not be the place for it but I am struggling I am not gonna lie, I cannot see a therapist till the 7th and I only get 12 free sessions and now that I have been termed a week before I got benefits I don't know what to do.

Don't really know if I am venting or asking for advice I am just so tired, this week has been hell for me.

Thanks for any comment given.",ptsd
"I can feel my brain and thought patterns literally changing  I live in Israel (let‚Äôs keep it civil please, I‚Äôm an individual and a human being and shouldn‚Äôt be held accountable for the actions of my government) and I‚Äôm having a really hard time. 

Even though I live in the center, and not up north where there‚Äôs alot of drama, I am under tremendous stress at all times. When I‚Äôm at home, I have to have suitable clothing on so if there‚Äôs an air raid siren I can run to the neighborhood shelter at a moment‚Äôs notice. I have a go bag for my boyfriend and I, waiting under our bed to be taken with us to the shelter, and we‚Äôve had to bring it with us many times, without knowing if we‚Äôd ever see our home again. 

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where we don‚Äôt bring the go bag with us to the shelter or even leave our house for every air raid siren. Via our emergency notification system, we can see if what‚Äôs coming is a hostile aircraft, or missiles, and we can act accordingly. We only really go to the shelter when we‚Äôre told to stay in a safe place until ‚Äúfurther notice‚Äù like during the second ballistic missile attack from Iran a few weeks ago‚Ä¶ 



There are a few stand out moments that I still have flashbacks of: Last winter there was a terror attack in my city, I was home alone and I ran out of my house to lock my gate, and bolt my windows. I turned off all the lights in the house and hid under my bed as terrorists stabbing people and running people over were literally on the street outside of my house. I called my parents who were outside of Israel for a trip at the time, and I spoke to them for what I thought could be the last time. 

As I mentioned previously, a few weeks ago there was a large scale ballistic missile attack from Iran, and I really struggled. The whole day things were tense and we were hearing rumors. My boyfriend and I were in the park with our dog when we heard explosions in the distance, which is not abnormal, but added to our growing fear. We then got word that the IDF has told all citizens to stay ‚Äúclose‚Äù to a shelter until further notice, and so we went home and waited. Just when I started dinner, our phones went off with emergency notifications that we had never seen before. Usually it‚Äôs something like: ‚ÄúMissile Attack. Head to safe room and stay there for 10 minutes‚Äù it takes 10 minutes for all the shrapnel from the missiles destroyed by the iron dome to fall, and to protect people from the shrapnel, they recommend staying in a shelter for that amount of time. But this time they didn‚Äôt tell us what was happening, just to go to a shelter immediately and stay until further notice. We grabbed our dog and our bag and went to the shelter. There were no air raid sirens, but we could see our neighbors heading to the shelter as well, carrying their guns, herding their kids and dogs down into the shelter. I tried to call my family who live on the other side of town, but the phone lines were down completely, and that‚Äôs when I started to have a panic attack. We sat on the floor in the corner of the shelter and I laid my head in my boyfriend‚Äôs lap and felt the walls shake with explosions. I didn‚Äôt know what was an interception and what was a fallen missile. I didn‚Äôt know if we would come out of the shelter in a few hours and see a wasteland, or if we would ever come out at all. Later my parents showed me a video they took of two missiles landing simultaneously a few kilometers away, and I watch the video on repeat now, I don‚Äôt know why, maybe to torture myself? 

There are air raid sirens more and more often lately, I‚Äôm a nanny and I can‚Äôt take my babies out of the neighborhood anymore; I used to take them to the library, the pool, the park‚Ä¶ Now with every step I take while pushing the stroller, I tell myself ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the building I‚Äôll run to if there‚Äôs an air raid siren‚Äù and before I even pass said building, I‚Äôm already looking for another one that will be a better option for when I pass it. I don‚Äôt put the shoulder straps on my baby so if I need to grab her quickly, I can just slide her out from the hip straps and not have to fumble with buttons. 

My boyfriend and I were going to visit some friends in Tel Aviv, I went to put on heels and I looked at my feet, realizing that if there was a siren or a terror attack, which are becoming common in Tel Aviv lately (I was at the scene of a shooting a few years ago in Tel Aviv, before the war) I wouldn‚Äôt be able to run and I might fall, which could cost me my life. 

My heart sinks and my ankles feel weak when I hear a loud motorcycle, when a car slows down beside me, when I‚Äôm home alone‚Ä¶ I get so afraid to take a shower in case there‚Äôs a siren and I can‚Äôt get dressed fast enough. 

The way I plan my life, the first thoughts that come into my head when someone walks close to me on the street, when I have to take the bus, when I hear a loud noise, when I wake up and I‚Äôm not sure where I am, show me that I‚Äôm not the same person I thought I was when the war started. I live in flight or fight mode all the time, and I‚Äôm scared that if I survive this, and everything goes back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù I‚Äôll be forever afraid.

"I‚Äôm sad, mad, and have a lot of anxiety. It gets severe Trigger warning : assault, death, loss

My boyfriend was killed in our home 2 months ago.

The day before his family came over for a drink. It was out of the blue, drugs were involved. It was the 2nd time his family ever came to visit us in the 3 months we lived together. We had been in a relationship for 6 months and knew each other for 8 months. The day before he was killed, we planned to have a drink just the 2 of us, as I mentioned his family came over unexpectedly. His sisters, his brother and his mom. We were having a drink and I ordered for some more. I didn‚Äôt want to share theirs so I decided I would stop drinking around 11pm maybe 12am and wait for the alcohol I ordered. It never arrived. When I stopped drinking, I went downstairs to sleep with my children. At some point around 4 or 5 his mother came downstairs and threatened to kill me and my children, that she was gonna comeback and burn our home down. So I called my boyfriend on his cellphone, from downstairs to where he was upstairs. I cried to him and told him what his mom just said. (Apparently she says things like that alot when drinking). He came to comfort me and one of his sister came downstairs as well to reassure me. They told me they wouldn‚Äôt let anything happen to us. They went back upstairs to continue to drink. Shortly after, I heard some noise coming from upstairs. I thought they would settle it on their own. But it kept going, so I went upstairs to check what was going on. 3 of his sisters were attacking him and he was fighting as hard as he could back. He was outnumbered. I saw one of his sisters pull out a knife and she began stabbing him. I couldn‚Äôt stop it and it all happened so fast. His chest was covered in blood. There was blood all over the walls and our bed. They finally stopped attacking him and on the way out, they warned me not to call the cops. But as soon as they walked out of the house, I locked it and called the ambulance. I was scared to call the cops. And I also didn‚Äôt know how serious his wounds were. I told him I‚Äôm going to call 911 and he agreed. That‚Äôs the last time I heard him say anything. 911 operator told me how to help him, to put pressure on his wounds but there were so many. The shirt I used filled with blood, his shirt filled with blood. The operator told me the ambulance was outside but when I went to check, they were treating his sister for a less serious wound. She stole his ambulance. It took the operator and the paramedics 10 minutes to work it out that she wasn‚Äôt the victim that needed help. 10 minutes was a lot while he was bleeding and in pain. His blood was filling his lungs, which I didn‚Äôt know at the time. I found out later when he passed away at the hospital. In between all that time, I had no idea when his other siblings and mother left. Or how the fight even started. All I knew is he fought for his life til the very end and he protected me and my babies. Our babies, he called them and raised them as his own. After the ambulance finally showed up to help, they began working on him, while I had to make sure the children were okay. The police showed up and the girls tried to frame me so I was detained. I was put in handcuffs and had to sit in the back of the cop truck while my boyfriend was dying and our kids were downstairs alone. What a nightmare. They asked me what happened and I told them my point of view. They handcuffed his 3 sisters and put the killer in the back seat with me. They let me out and uncuffed me. I was able to go back inside to try to be by his side without getting in the way. Eventually they stabilized him enough to transport him to the hospital. He later died, not enough oxygen to his brain and his heart couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. I went to tell his family and from there everything felt so unreal. I got to be part of the planning of his services. For which I‚Äôm grateful. 2 of his sisters were charged with manslaughter and 1 with murder. The 2 were released and the 1 is currently still in jail. A week after he passed away, the day of his funeral it all hit me. But I still felt numb. I felt numb for a week and a half and then the anxiety came. It felt like I was going to die all the time for any little reason. I still think that even if my heart races a bit that it‚Äôs the end, or if I get a random sharp pain, that I‚Äôm gonna die. It‚Äôs terrifying. I was on anti-anxiety meds for 5 weeks, prescribed 7 Ativan and I have been in touch with my therapist who I‚Äôve had for 2 years already. But after the 4th week of meds, I decided to have a drink. 2 missed doses and drinking too much messed me up so bad. My anxiety was at its worst that it‚Äôs ever been in my whole life. For a week straight. I was so scared of everything. I called the ambulance to get my vitals checked and they reassured me it‚Äôs anxiety. It‚Äôs just a nightmare. As of today I‚Äôve been okay for a week now. But today I had some anxiety and realized it‚Äôs never gonna completely go away or go back to normal. It‚Äôs always gonna be there. Just like the grief.

I‚Äôve had to shorten the story quite a bit. So many details but unnecessary to mention. I miss him so much, he was the only man willing to step up for my babies. I wanted to marry him, I wanted our life to be long together. His got cut so short. And this experience made me so scared to live life. Fearing that I will die. I used to be so careless about my life. I almost miss that, it was better than being scared all the time. It‚Äôs going to take a long time to heal from this. I want to be able to help others in the future, to let them know they aren‚Äôt alone and they‚Äôll get through it. ",ptsd

"Dealing with trauma post-disaster  While I‚Äôd rather be anywhere but here in this sub at the moment, I‚Äôm realizing I need to find ways to deal with this anxiety. I live in WNC and have been here throughout all of hurricane helene. I was alone in my apartment, just me in my pets, for a week and a half, so afraid at first we wouldn‚Äôt be able to get enough food or water. We had no power for 13 days, no cell service at all for 3 so I truly had no way to know if my parents who were trapped by fallen trees were alive or not. We had no running water for almost 3 weeks. Several towns are now gone, and reading yesterday that had the dam near me failed, I would likely be dead along with everyone in its path has just worsened my PTSD anxiety to a level it hasn‚Äôt been in a long time. I‚Äôm also a nurse at the hospital here and was back at work the Monday after it hit, so not even a break. We didn‚Äôt have running water there so we bathed using buckets. Work is still the only place I can get a shower. 

I am anxious about everything now. I go from obsessing over what if my pets and I had drowned along with tens of thousands of people to panic about the election (which was already stressful) to panic about things just so far out of my control it‚Äôs crazy. I did okay during the disaster, somewhat, but it‚Äôs just all hit me and I am trying to cope. Sleeping is proving pretty difficult with nightmares about drowning. How can I ever feel safe in my home again? 

I have an appointment with a therapist this coming week and I don‚Äôt even know how to talk about it. Condensing my OCD/PTSD history and explaining how I feel now just seems so overwhelming but I know I need to go. My anxiety now that the gravity of the situation is hitting is just awful. I don‚Äôt want to be crying a couple times a day and afraid to sleep in case something happens. Even light rain is terrifying for us now‚Äîit starts and my friends are panicking too because the last time it really rained left whole towns as rubble and killed so many people. 

Thanks for reading‚Äîany suggestions as to ways to relax and cope temporarily would be wonderful. I will keep my therapy appointment and I‚Äôve also ordered a trauma journal too. I appreciate anyone who read this. ",ptsd
"I wish I could just quiet my brain, I don‚Äôt recognize myself anymore  I was diagnosed with CPTSD almost a year ago exactly. It gave me a lot of insight into my thought process and how/why I am the way I am. Still, there was no real before and after or symptoms (not to my knowledge). I had always been that way. It was just before and after being able to describe them though a diagnosis.

Then five months ago, a traumatic event happened, a violent death. It's difficult because both the perpetrator and victim were family, so there's equal parts of loss and betrayal.

Now I have a true delineation of before and after. Even if I had PTSD long before this, I had a lifetime of finding ways to hold onto my own identity amongst it all. Now I barely recognize myself.

I'm really struggling right now. Treatment is a mixed bag. Medication has helped ease my nightmares and I'm drugged enough to get through the nights more or less. But during the day, my mind is so active. I think of everything that everyone around me might say, think, or do. I don't want to be caught of guard. I don't want to be vulnerable. This ranges from being ""prepared"" mentally in case a trip turn to the grocery store turns deadly to wondering if others close to me are planning bad things.

I love my partner so much that love doesn't seem like a strong enough word. I am tremendously grateful for his companionship, his partnership, and the strength that both have endowed me with. I have always trusted him and he has always validated that choice back tenfold. He is the only person I feel physically safe around right now, even though I judge myself for being frightened that others may harm me physically for no reason whatsoever.

There's other ways my anxiety is suddenly manifesting though with regards to our relationship. He's been my rock and has picked up a lot of slack in helping me take care of even the basics-- making sure I eat, things like that. He hasn't pulled away. He's held me close. But now he'll be sitting next to me, doing nothing suspicious, and my mind jumps to wild conclusions about the longevity or security of our relationship. I've lashed out with sudden frustrations that don't adequately respresent my everyday state of mind or perception of our relationship. I've spiraled. 

I'm not working anymore. I'm grateful to be able to take some time off. I'm receiving short term disability. Which leaves me with quite a bit less per month than I usually made at work, but is helping me to try and ""focus"" on recovery.

The free time is also detrimental though because I just can't stop thinking. I just wish I could turn my brain off and rest. It's so hard to be present. When I manage it, im able to enjoy brief periods of life but then it all gets lost again in the chaos. I just wish it would be quiet.

I'm not interested in it in the first place because I'm on so many psych drugs. Low sexual function is a side effect so I just started taking Buspirone 10mg to help. I'm in therapy and am debating starting ketamine treatment to help with the overall anxiety I have associated with sex along with helping my depression, and forming new healthy habits. 

What should I do? I don't want this to ruin my relationship. I have a very safe and open relationship so I never feel pressured but he gets depressed if we wait too long. I've done EMDR therapy for my C-PTSD and had an awful experience and refuse to ever do it again. My current therapist and I are doing cognitive and dialectical behavioral therapy. I've even done ECT (electro convulsion therapy) to deal with my PAST suicidal ideations. It was a miracle for that but I'm still depressed. Does anyone have any supplements or remedies to help improve libido? I'm clearly open to trying things.

I was also wondering what effects ketamine would have on C-PTSD. I've done research and the company I'd go with starts their doses at roughly 20mg daily. I asked the live chat about interactions with my medications and they said there were none. 

I'm on Clonazepam .5mg 3x daily for chronic anxiety, Vyvanse 50mg for ADHD, Sertraline 100mg, and Lamotrigine 150mg 2x daily for bipolar. Some of the resources I found implied that there COULD be interactions but I'm not sure if that depends on the dose or not. Thanks so much for your help and advice! ",ptsd

"A little late(depending on where you are)  Hello all. 

Recently, I was diagnosed with ptsd with dissociative features. After a pretty band panic attack that‚Äôs left me pretty badly disassociated since June of this year, I started therapy recently, and was given the ptsd diagnosis. It‚Äôs been pretty heavy, but the good news is I‚Äôll be starting emdr therapy soon. I had a few questions for anyone else experiencing this as well. 

1) how long do/did your disassociation last?

2) while in intense disassociation, is it normal to have hallucinations? (Mostly for me it‚Äôs auditory, and it‚Äôs always random words. Occasionally I‚Äôll see things, but I‚Äôm aware both are hallucinations. Even though I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm gonna lose that grip)

3) if you‚Äôve done emdr, did it help? 

Thanx a bunch! ",ptsd

"Does anyone happen to be a parent to your own parent?  M20. Me and my mother live poorly, even though we are always in touch with other family members, even dad's side. Mom's kin isn't really all suppotive because they're either as poor or just don't really care about us. My mother could always contact with dad's kin, even himself because they are kind and actually caring and supportive to each other (they divorced when I was 3 because ""they don't fit each other as a married couple""). But she seemed to do this very rarely. We both went and still go through unpleasant financial problems (which only get worse and she doesn't even realize that). 

I understand that mother suffered from her own parents, that her father has gone when she was still young, her mother doesn't care about her etc. In fact, I was unable not to know that because she states her family issues every second time she breaks down which is a lot. She finds it normal to make her son she just screamed on comfort her.

And these breakdowns weren't mere screams, ‚Äì they made me unable to comprehend any normal quarrel or trouble because they seemed like a regular conversation in comparison. I thought that such humiliation was normal. Only recently it was shocking to me to even listen to someone's mental problems, I didn't even think people could be troubled so easily. I couldn't find one, ONE amusing or at least somewhat not frightening story I myself experienced in my childhood, couldn't remember a single moment I felt truly safe. But I do recall a lot of people asking me if I'm all right when I was simply standing or sitting, I turned out to never feel free neither. 

I undoubtetly was born without a goal of parenting but only means of calming herself. That childish, irresponsible brat! How come she finds it acceptable to be calmed by her own child and not the other way around? How does she want me to be empowered, to even want to live when almost everything she does is let me down and give nothing in exchange of suffering her tantrums? What the hell is she thinking? 

She heals with time, however. It's disgusting to admit her current state is not even her worst. She belittled me in my childhood as much as one can belittle another. That she's broken does not excuse her in the slightest, why making a child in such conditions to begin with? Why is it that she depends on me but I would rather starve to death than contact to her ever again? 

But, my life keeps going. I'm not close enough to dad and mom's family tree is a clusterfuck of unhealthy people and people who try to fix it. I prefer to just consider myself with no family at all. I believe only after I get rid of them all I can finally enjoy my life. ",ptsd
"Working through trauma amidst triggers I am almost two years out from my main PTSD-triggering event. I have been working with a therapist and a doctor and taking medications. Every time I start to feel good and think maybe it is time to try more than talk therapy (EMDR or WET) I end up facing a trigger out of the blue and get thrown into a trauma response. When I'm in these trauma response head spaces, I don't think it would be productive or healthy to put in more trauma processing work. 

TLDR: Is there any advice on balancing trauma processing work between flair ups.

"What to do when it's just there in the back of your head I'm not actively thinking about it at all. But I can just feel it there. It kinda feels like I'm resisting thinking about it.

But I sometimes have to pause what I'm doing because having the trauma on the background all the time kinda drains my brain. What can I do?

"Family wants to take a roadtrip So a little over a year ago I was in a horrific car accident, my coupe ended up under the trailer of a semi truck, I had to get surgery, I am still in physical therapy, and in mental therapy and have been diagnosed with pretty severe PTSD as a result of the collision. 

I am originally from Indiana (currently living in Texas) and my family wants to roadtrip to my hometown for Christmas. I‚Äôve tried voicing that I am extremely anxious about being in a car for 18+ hours, on highways that are plagued with semi trucks, and are just typically pretty busy. 

My family keeps saying ‚Äújust don‚Äôt worry‚Äù & ‚Äújust sleep the whole way there‚Äù (even before this accident I could never sleep in cars so I doubt I‚Äôd be able to now.) I tried to look into flying instead but it would be $800 to fly, and that‚Äôs wayyy out of budget for me.

"How to cope with continuation of anger and nightmares  F20 and got out of 2 abusive relationships, one a best friend and the other my partner. Almost a year ago, my best friend was going through a traumatic time and drove incredibly recklessly with alcohol in her system and me in the passenger seat. I didn‚Äôt know she was drunk until it was too late (I being 19 at the time didn‚Äôt have much experience or knowledge behind what drunk behavior would look like.)

She was screaming the entire time, got pulled over going 90 mph and got off with a warning because she was sobbing hysterically (The cop that pulled her over came to our passenger side since we were on the highway, which is probably why he didn‚Äôt smell the alcohol. I wish he would‚Äôve so I wouldn‚Äôt have had to experience any of what she did to me.) , saying she felt like she was gonna crash her car, saying delusional stuff to strangers in traffic whilst stopping, made me drive after she promised me she wouldn‚Äôt do that because I have EXTREME driving anxiety and I had no idea where we were, then proceeded to drink more alcohol in the passenger seat and when I told her to stop she said it was just water, kept being on her phone whilst driving even after I begged her to stop, had the music up way too loudly so we couldn‚Äôt hear the directions when I tried to turn it down, swerving, stopping in the middle of city traffic for along time to find her vape, and was just really disrespectful to me the entire ride. I keep having nightmares about when she was driving me over the bridge and acting crazy. I thought for sure she was going to swerve us off. 

Sometimes I can still smell the alcohol and hear the things she was saying. She did a bunch of other more messed up things, and in conclusion, had a whole month to apologize to me but never did. I gave her a home to live in, took care of her pet, drove her places, and quite literally took care of her. The fact that she put my life in danger, treated me absolutely horribly and just never apologized, and then proceeded to participate in a kiss with my partner is just a pain I can‚Äôt ever get over. The fact that she called me fucked up for calling her out and saying she‚Äôs disgusting for not apologizing to me makes my blood boil. She apologized for my partners behavior, but not hers. I didn‚Äôt deserve what she did to me. 

She kept making the excuse that ‚Äúshe was dealing with extremely heavy things.‚Äù . I was also dealing with trauma but didn‚Äôt inflict more on her. I always have nightmares about her and I feel like I‚Äôll never be free. She follows me everywhere and I just want her to leave my mind. She was nothing but a horrible friend to me, traumatized or not. She ALWAYS put men first and discarded me and what I‚Äôve been through. When I was sobbing because of what she said to me, she was laying in bed with the random stranger she invited in her house instead of me. She didn‚Äôt care about the pain or trauma I also experienced. She didn‚Äôt care how she scared me when she punched the bathroom wall, or when she would constantly bring up porn and sex and I begged her to stop because I had my own sexual trauma. It was always HER trauma that mattered more. 

When she asked me where I wanted to sleep and I said her room, she said ‚Äúoh well actually the boy wants to sleep with me tonight,‚Äù that hurt me badly. I feel my anger suffocating me about the entire situation. I want peace and I  want to be free from the nightmares. It feels like I never will. I understand she felt bad, but that doesn‚Äôt excuse her treatment towards me and the fact that she didn‚Äôt apologize. She could‚Äôve owned up for what she did, but she instead chose to pretend it didn‚Äôt happen and blame it on her trauma and my partner (who was also in the wrong.) I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôve had residential care for 3 months and intense therapy. I feel at a loss.

"Needed a place to talk  Hi all

First time posting to this thread. 

Lately, as in the past four weeks or so, I‚Äôve been struggling a lot with my PTSD. 

It‚Äôs like an unwelcome relative that comes for a visit every so often and messes up everything around it. 

In 1998, when I was 13F, I experienced a traumatic event. It took me about 7 years to seek help. Luckily, I found an amazing provider who was Harvard educated and was one of the few people doing EMDR therapy at that time in my area. She was phenomenal and truly saved my life. I was in a bad way when I went to see her, very self destructive. The EMDR literally saved me from myself. 

I went onto college, then grad school, got a medical degree, began practicing at a large company in my field just outside of Boston. 

While there, I broke up with a longtime boyfriend. Went back to dating online. Met someone, and sadly had another traumatic experience almost 20 years later. This second time was much worse. 

I tried to hold onto to my life at the moment. I was in denial it had even happened again and tried to brush aside the physical remnants of the bad event, tried to keep pushing on moving forward. But my performance at work started failing. I was making mistakes. I wasn‚Äôt myself. I couldn‚Äôt focus or concentrate. Nobody knew. Then I got sick. It was awful. 

I quit my job and moved into a family beach cottage. Away from the city. 
Tried to regroup.  

I was drinking again - now at the beach cottage.  I eventually realized I needed to admit to myself something had gone wrong - something had happened to me. Again.  

I felt humiliated and ashamed that I could have ‚Äúlet this happen again‚Äù.  I sought out treatment, help again. And this time I knew where to begin. 
EMDR. 
Found an amazing specialist. She was expensive, but worth it. I went 2-3 times a week. I started working on renovating the cottage. I worked on starting my own practice in this new location. Started to live again with purpose. 

I work on many of the PTSD symptoms that were stopping me in my professional and personal life. She showed me how much I was dissociating and how often I would be triggered into panic attacks. She taught me how to ground myself. And the EMDR worked. It helped me admit what happened. Then start to heal. I still couldn‚Äôt work yet, but I was getting better. Then covid happened. 

Fast forward a few more years, I‚Äôm still not back to working medical in my field.  Taking care of others the way I would want to show up for them and be the best provider I can be - seems impossible when I‚Äôm so deeply broken still. Damaged. Or that‚Äôs how I feel. 
I will go back to it someday. I hope. 

But now, this year I have a partner and a little boy. The three of us and our little dog make up our happy little family. We love each other deeply and we‚Äôve been able to spend so much time this past year together, watching my son grow and learn. 

But the month of October can sometimes be hard. Some years it is not, like last year. Some years, it triggers bad memories, nightmares, anxiety attacks, drinking benders, and dissociation episodes that seem unavoidable. 
And now I have my little boy. 

This month has been hard. I‚Äôve been drinking more than I realized.  10 AM and I want to crack a beer open. I don‚Äôt - but I deeply want to. But why? There is no threat in my life right now. No major stress or impending doom. I‚Äôm content and happy on paper. 

Thank god my partner is so understanding. It is one of the things that we share in common. He has C-Ptsd from an unsafe unstable childhood. So when I tell him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not okay right now, but please don‚Äôt hug me. I don‚Äôt want to be touched. I just need some time to readjust. I will be okay. I always am. Just please make sure our son is safe in his play area right now, so I don‚Äôt need to worry about where he is.‚Äù 

He immediately understands, no questions asked. He helps me the way I need the help. I‚Äôll do the same for him. 

I isolate. That is what I do when I feel my PTSD rearing up again. Isolating makes me feel better. But also makes me feel guilty. These days in October in New England are some of the most beautiful days we get. And I wanted to enjoy this beautiful Saturday afternoon outside with my baby boy and partner - but I just can‚Äôt today. I just need to be inside. In my room. In my bed. Resting and trying to calm down my nervous system. 


Ground yourself. 

Repeat your mantra ‚Äú You are safe. You are safe. You are far away in time and space from that day. That person who hurt you is not here. They are far far away in time and space. You are safe. You are safe‚Äù

"Im having a hard time coping with PTSD I dont want to get into details on what caused it, but i have been diagnosed with it a few months ago. Im on meds and i had a lot of factors that made it worse for me. I have ADHD, GAD, Autism and chronic pain as well. Oh, and i already had a sleep disorder before this, so i domt know how it will mix up. So i feel like shit, somedays i feel like my body has been run over by a truck. Im crying, im exhausted and i am really stressed. Fucking hate how it all feels right now. 


I feel suicidal again, i fucking hate this as well. I dont really want to take any steps into killing myself, but i desperately need the pain to subside. I feel angry, sad, in pain a lot. I am on meds but im not sure if we need to up the dose or maybe add something different (im not going to do anything on continued meds before i talk with my psychiatrist, they will have some idea on what do, at least i hope they do). 


I feel hopeless, alone and exhausted. I dont know what i should do, who to ask for help or how to make it a little better. I feel desperate. I feel so many things right now, and it is overwhelming. And then some days i just feel kinda numb, i dont know how else to explain it",ptsd
How do I come to terms with this (childhood torture) It still doesn‚Äôt feel real my mind still feels brainwashed and hurt. I just want the pain to stop. I feel constantly dissociated and part of me feels lost to the past. I want to move on with my life but I constantly wonder if I really made it out or if I‚Äôm still there. They tried emdr and it went awfully and someone got hurt. I‚Äôm trying it again but I‚Äôm scared. Even after I got out of the house I was sent to wilderness by my foster parents and the state.

I want it to stop I want to live but then I have days like this where I don‚Äôt see the point. Prazosin didn‚Äôt help so I‚Äôm still plagued by nightmares.

"my abuser bragged to strangers about what he did to me the other day, i was eating my lunch in the library of my school‚Äîsomething i do specifically because it is mostly empty and i know that he wont be there. my guard is always up anyway, and i frequently scan the library to make sure its still safe. this day in particular, i was very focused on a video, and was paying much less attention to my surroundings than usual. when i was about to leave the library and return to class, i looked up, and lo and behold, there he was sitting at a table in the library with a group of people. i panicked, and before i could even think, i bolted out the emergency exit that i purposely sit next to. it was a fairly dramatic ordeal. i went straight to the guidance office, and refused to leave my spot hiding on the floor in the corner of a counselors office for the rest of the day (several hours). this whole situation was incredibly distressing to me. im still grappling with the fact that he is going to my school in the first place, as he was put into online school for the years following what he did to me and my friends. but now hes back.  
anyway, two days later, i was sitting in my class when the person sitting next to me asked to talk to me about him. my blood ran cold. how did she know him? how did she know my involvement with him? despite my trepidation, i heard her out. turns out, she was sitting at the table in the library with him. she had been sitting with her friend, and he had come up to them with one of his friends. apparently, when they saw my grand escape, he pointed it out to the whole group and proceeded to TELL THEM ABOUT EVERYTJING THAT HE DID, WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE. he told then everything, he was fucking BRAGGING about it. my classmate told me that everyone at the table got super uncomfortable with the things he was saying (thank god). i am just in so much shock and disbelief. i have been so triggered since all of this happened, constantly trapped in my head. i just needed to get this out there, to people who understand. ive never posted to this subreddit before, so hello, all.  

this is all so surreal to me. i have spoken to the school about him countless times. they know all about him, they know all about our history. they have done next to nothing to help me. for fucks sake, he ended up a felon after everything that happened, which is particularly difficult to accomplish at our young age. i dont understand how he is still allowed to go to my school. everyone keeps telling me ""hes in therapy, hes taking meds, hes changed!"" but i know the truth. i can see the truth in the way he smirks at me as we pass each other in the hallways. i can see the truth in how he shit talks me on his instagram story. i can see the truth in how he is constantly joking about the ways he hurt me, as if he didnt ruin my fucking life. i am sick and tired of everyone excusing the things he has done. bold of me to assume that once we were in high school, they would actually take it seriously. had they taken my concerns seriously in middle school, i wouldnt be here posting to a ptsd subreddit for fucks sake. i feel so forsaken in so many ways, and so disillusioned.

"Newish SA and other trauma PTSD diagnosis I (25f) got diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD earlier this year.

I am an unreasonably self aware person. I know when I am not doing things that I should. I know when I am burning out, but honestly even though I am self aware I am not always good about dealing with it in healthy ways. I went looking for my ADHD diagnosis after doing a ton of my own research and so when I got that diagnosis in my head all I could think was ‚Äúduh, tell me something I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù And boy did they. 

My therapist a couple weeks later asked if he could give me the PTSD test, he didn‚Äôt call it that but I cannot remember the name for the life of me. I agreed and at the end I got my firm diagnosis. He literally told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to say that you have PTSD.‚Äù  Needless to say I was in shock. For me my trauma was just a thing that happened to me and it was never like I went to war so why do I of all people have it. 

I ended up stopping going to my therapy sessions (I know, I shouldn‚Äôt have done that), and I ended just spiraling and thinking about how my life was not bad enough to have PTSD. Then I started actually thinking.

I started thinking about the 4 times in my 25 years of life that I have been SA‚Äôd, one being at 3 yrs old. As well I started thinking about how my biological mother was an absent drug addict and the only mother figure I‚Äôve ever known (not my biological mother) overdosed. And how my parents made me be the adult and their mediator at 13. And I started to realize that these aren‚Äôt normal things. But I genuinely started stewing in them and it started to cause me to spiral.

My struggles with sex and intimacy very recently killed a 5 year relationship and I don‚Äôt know how to feel healthy and good about it. I have always been open and talked about sex but hid the part of me that was uncomfortable with it. The partner that I was just with was the first person I was with that I didn‚Äôt have to have some sort of vice like alcohol to be with. I don‚Äôt know how to make myself comfortable with sex.

I really need advice. I‚Äôve been avoiding this but I can‚Äôt keep avoiding it anymore. Any advice is appreciated. As well idk if I‚Äôm ready to go back to therapy yet in all honesty. My main question is how can I work to have a healthy relationship with sex?",ptsd

"Defense Mechanisms I have been doing a lot of self-reflection and trying to understand myself lately. And I started to question something about myself that I never quite understood and then realized that it was a defense mechanism: telling my business to anyone and everyone without it being that awkward oversharing way.

Once upon a time I used to be very private and guarded. Then I was in a very bad relationship to put it nicely. I mean he‚Äôs the reason why I‚Äôm here in this community with you all. Homeboy would constantly threaten to blackmail me and tell everyone all my secrets. There were some that were basically life ruining things. 

Ever since that ended, I guess I‚Äôve taken on the mindset that if I tell everyone my business then nobody will be able to do that again. Nobody will have any grounds to blackmail me. I am an open book. Want to hear about my deepest darkest secrets? No problem! And this defense mechanism is certainly one that I‚Äôm actually glad for, in an odd way. I never get embarrassed about oversharing since there IS purpose behind it. 

What kind of odd defense mechanisms have you all developed from trauma?",ptsd
"Does anyone else feel like their ‚Äútraumatic event‚Äù isnt real sometimes? <<CW: Themes of death/abuse/SA>>
I‚Äôm a psych student (I know, irony) and obviously I pay attention to anything I learn about trauma. Despite it ruining a lot of my life, I do find it interesting and I hope I can help others one say. However, this means I also read the diagnostic criteria for PTSD a lot and Criterion A always throws me off.

Like I get what I went through sucked. Specifically there are 3 events that I think led to my problems with PTSD. And yeah most of my teenage years I dealt with abuse that I thought I would die from, but it was rarely physical just a lot of threats and psychological abuse. And in the other cases like yeah I could have been actually hurt, but I wasnt, again just threatened and harrassed (i think is the right word?). I saw a lot i shouldnt have seen and I felt alot I shouldnt have but I think the lack of actual directness bothers me maybe? Like it should have been worse to make me feel like this? I read other stuff and unintentially compare, and I know I shouldnt, but I always feel like im overreacting when im ‚Äúfine‚Äù. At least until the intrusive memories come back or i flinch at a similar looking guy and then I think im valid until i get ‚Äúbetter‚Äù again for a gap. Its also really frustrating that ive been through objectively worse experiences, but they dont bother me at all. Like whats up with that???

It makes me think what i went through wasnt real or actually traumatizing (even though its been ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù by professionals that it was) but i still have to deal with all of the issues that came along with it? Its really frustrating. Especially because I know if someone told me the same thing happened to them I wouldnt think they were overreacting. But for some reason I dont feel that way about myself. Obviously I wish that it didnt happen at all, but if it had to why couldnt I actually feel like it was real and not be stuck in this middle ground half the time. Idk, no one else I know seems to understand or feel this way. I was hoping someone else may have a better understanding on here.

I will start a conversation with someone and maybe 10 seconds in I feel as if I completely zone out but I'm not even sure if I'm thinking about other things or just not listening? I'll catch myself and try to get back to listening and almost immediately my brain does the same thing. I will also I guess go into my own mind and my hands or body will start moving, and eventhough I'm kind of aware I'm doing it I'm not aware of me doing it...I find it rrally hard to explain. It kinda of feels like tunnel vision where sometimes it doesn't even feel like I'm looking at anything and I'm in my own little bubble? Anyways, it looks weird to those around me and they'll say something to me about it and then I feel like a weirdo. Then in groups I feel super disconnected and not paying attention to the people around me but more so of whats going on but I'm still not really thinking? I'm not sure if this would even be connected to my PTSD diagnosis and worth bringing up next time i get seen or if it's normal and I'm just noticing it more often lately.

The only reason I've really noticed is because people keep bringing it up to me and I feel as if it's affecting my relationships, friendships, and job. I won't have access to a mental health professional for a few months but I don't want to bring it up if it's nothing serious. Does anyone else experience this and mind sharing?",ptsd
"Remembering, then everything falls apart again.  Last Thursday, I had a conversation with a mental health working in the hopes to pick up some extra support. It was the first time in months, if not years, where I went over (not even in depth) what has happened to me and the emotions of it all came flooding back. 

In my daily life, I don‚Äôt think about it, I just get on with things. Work, DIY, gaming etc. I don‚Äôt, ever, think about it. Flashbacks, or triggers or whatever, when they do happen, I just squash with something to distract me. Nightmares, dreams, maybe I‚Äôll make a note off, but I don‚Äôt really reflect on them. 

I think I have just, got used to a life of dissociating, masking, and trying not to think about it‚Ä¶. So the emotions don‚Äôt come out. Seeking help from friends when I am upset is a no go because of how awful they have been in the past, dealing with it. People just don‚Äôt know what to do when someone is upset. So, I just, have adjusted my emotions and being to fit more ‚Äòacceptable‚Äô. Not to say I would be going and having a mental breakdown each time I see a friend. 

But yeah, I guess, Thursday was a bit of the shock to the system, because I actually gave time for my emotions to come out a bit. 

I guess, I wish I felt that seeking support from other people, was pointless. People really just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Sorry, not sure what this is. More of just a rant or something I guess. Just hope maybe someone understands. ",ptsd
"Is ptsd from weed possible?? I'm not a regular consumer of weed but I've taken an edible a few times.. not much (dumb teen...I've learned my lesson) .

So you know the feeling of the panic attacks  and mind craziness you get during a green out well at random times through the day I get that exact feeling for no reason at all and it feels the exact same as my panick attacks from when I have previously greened out.

"Coming to terms with having PTSD Recently diagnosed with PTSD as a 30+ year old. 

It‚Äôs kind of surreal. 

I spent all of my life blaming myself (I won‚Äôt go into all the negative self talk but y‚Äôall get it). 

Finally I started going to therapy and almost immediately my psychologist said ‚ÄúYUP, You‚Äôve got complex PTSD‚Äù. No if ands or buts. All those years spent thinking I was broken‚Ä¶ finally having the validation that I‚Äôve been emotionally injured for decades. 

It‚Äôs a lot to take in, I won‚Äôt lie. While it‚Äôs freeing, it‚Äôs also paradigm shifting. I spent my entire life believing I was one thing and now I‚Äôm told, no, you were just traumatized from birth to 17 and then continued to retraumatize yourself well into your 30s. 

This doesn‚Äôt really have a point, I just wanted to say hello. To say that I feel so free now knowing that I have some kind of diagnosis. 

I hope everyone like us can find community and find a way to a life they love to live, free of shame and self contempt. ‚ù§Ô∏è

"Bad nightmare: my abusive ex and the death of my mom suddenly coincided I have cPTSD because of the death of my mom (15 years ago), and trauma from losing my cat who was my life support after losing her (7 years ago), then I was an abusive relationship for three years (2 years ago). Literally all my dreams were really bad nightmares since I was a teen, my mom was already really sick back then, and EMDR, about 5 years ago, helped a lot. I now still have nightmares most of the time but not every single night and they‚Äôre less intense. I also know what triggers it, horror movies and anything to do with anything paranormal, so I stay away from it.

Well, I think I found a new trigger and didn‚Äôt realize how bad the trauma from my ex was, because I watched Woman of the Hour on Netflix on a serial killer in the 70s and basically relived that movie with my ex as the serial killer in my sleep just now. Normally my nightmares about my ex and the ones about my mom (and cat) dying are separate dreams, but this time everything came together in one nightmare and it was so awful. The whole dream I had to prevent my ex from killing my two current cats, and it ended with him killing both my parents in front of my eyes üò≠

I honestly thought I wasn‚Äôt as traumatized by my ex as I am. In therapy we discussed EMDR after I got out of that relationship but things seemed to got better, but this dream made me realized how I‚Äôm always looking over my shoulder in real life as well. I hate waking up like this and I also hate having another trigger, because I like true crime shows. I absolutely loved my mom, and she never did anything to traumatize me, it was just the situation we were in together. But my ex definitely did actively try to hurt me, and it‚Äôs just so scary to suddenly see all of that trauma come together in one dream‚Ä¶",ptsd

I understand if somebody isn‚Äôt educated enough to give decent advice, and if that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs better to just scroll past then to comment something as ignorant as that.

It‚Äôs worse because my abusers don‚Äôt really regret what they did‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt even just one person, three people in my life did this to me at different points in life, & I know none of them regret it.

i (21nb) finally started psychotherapy targeted at PTSD last month, and had a session with my therapist who i got along with pretty well. between that first session and our meant to be second one, i went through something that triggered my PTSD immensely, and she was made aware of this prior to our session. then she just never turned up, and it happened again last week. 

i got a call on Monday saying that im being reassigned to a new therapist, and i should hear back by the end of the week (i.e. today) and i haven't heard anything. im so incredibly overwhelmed and anxious with everything going on currently, and having no one to talk it through with is really not helping.

"How do I mom with PTSD? (TW-SI, SA) Looking for parental advice. I'm mom to a 12 year old and a 7 year old.  Love my boys and I wish I could give them the world. However, I continue to be triggered as certain milestones are met. I realize I'm projecting my illness onto them and they do not deserve that. I hate myself for how angry I can be and the things I will scream. I'm in therapy. Goodness, I feel like I am trying everything but there is no permanent fix to my over- reactions. 

My entire life I've had SI and I made my first attempt when I was 25. My second attempt was 4 years ago. My ingrained mindset is that my life will be short because I cannot be the mom my boys need me to be. So there's a subconscious bias towards not building the tightest bond with them. Which is not helpful! 

I know it would help for me to accept and be mindful about my mental illness. I love meditation and learning about Buddhism. I cannot get myself to incorporate the practices I learn in the real world. I lose my head so fast. I hate it. 

My abuse began when my abuser would have been around 12 years old. Puberty is terrifying me. I feel sheer panic at any sex conversations and I worry that around every corner is a pedo. I have irrational reactions to him being online. 

I realize I'm so far gone and I need to get it together. I am doing TMS at the moment, for the second time. I've had countless hospitalizations, done a variety of therapies, tried Spravato, stayed at a residential place for women who experienced trauma...... I guess hopefully I'm better than I was but I don't want to freak out and scream at my sons even one more time. I scare myself, I know I'm scaring them. 

Does it even make sense for me to hope I can be a better mother? They are obsessed with their dad so I often consider the idea of giving them to him completely and giving up on myself. Just so that I avoid doing any more harm to them. I weigh what might be worse - a parent dying by suicide or living with a screaming parent who is likely borderline abusive. 

Has anyone parented well with PTSD? Are my issues always going to be driving a wedge between my kids and I? What might be your thoughts?

"I think I just had my first full-body & mind flashback to a time which is still cloudy from amnesia (& I don't want the amnesia to go away, I don't want the memories anymore) I was having anxiety & a panic attack from emetophobia. But partway through it, something triggered - teachers, nit the teacher voice, don't want it, don't want it anymore, teachers aren't safe, don't want it. When I managed to be grounded enough to lie down (54321 method), it was as if something unlocked. I kept having rapid abstract thoughts & sensations which go back to two of my traumas (one when I was 13 - 15 but peaked at 15, & 1 when I was 8). It was very scary, and I couldn't stop crying, or feeling relief each time I said to myself I don't want it anymore, don't want it, don't want it, I don't like this anymore, I don't want this anymore. Towards the end, it felt less like a flashback and more like... purging? Detox? As of it was all finally leaving. 


Now I'm catching my breath & coming back to myself. I've got Spotify on with music, I'm singing quietly to regulate my breathing, I'm stimming, and I'm aware I'm dissociating slightly in order to keep my mind safe & away from those memories. ",ptsd

The psychotic state was very traumatic. I had PTSD already from being on life support and nearly dying. This was worse though. It was like being on a Holodeck with all my worst nightmares. I still have to tell myself on a daily basis, it didn't happen, look at how ridiculous and impossible it all was. But it's harder to get through to myself that that wasn't real when I'm dissociating and am depersonalized and often derealized, not completely but a little. I don't feel real sometimes. During all of that I lost my memory. Now it's back, but other than my mom and dad, I don't really have any connection with anybody. My brother and sisters hate me and I feel no affection for them at all. It's like, I remember that life but I don't feel like it was me that lived it.

He lies in a desolate bed, under warm blankets, his head utop a pillow. A sigh builds and erupts from his chest, entirely voluntary. Eyes shut, the difference unchanged, the darkness immeasurable. Beyond awoken, despite desperation for unconsciousness. Gnashing of teeth, clenching fists, shortness of breath. Waves of unbridled stress bound, seemingly unstoppable. 

Calm to despair, relaxation to agony, a never ending cycle. Perfectly still, tossing and turning, the sheets unraveling and twisting, the bed still perfectly made. Fettered windows, light peers through the curtain, a wretched veil. Haunting visages of times long since past, days or decades?

"Has anyone else backslid with their anxiety since getting diagnosed with PTSD? TW: suicide and self harm 
‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî
I was diagnosed with anxiety in middle school and started meds in high school (my mom was opposed for a long time). I also had depression. I was in therapy and got ahold of my anxiety. I had tapered down my dose of SSRI‚Äôs once I got to college and managed to really get my anxiety under control. I haven‚Äôt self harmed in 3 years. 

And then I underwent an experience that gave me PTSD, about a year and a half ago. Since then, all the work I did to finally get my anxiety and depression under control came crashing down.  I feel like I had taken years to make a ball of yarn out of a long thread, and within the span of months, someone attached a drill to the yarn and un-did all my hard work. 

I was suicidal and had thoughts of hurting myself for the first time in YEARS a few days ago. I‚Äôm slowly crawling out of a depressive episode that‚Äôs lasted a couple weeks - my last one was sometime in high school, and I‚Äôm currently a junior in college. 

I feel so frustrated with myself. I worked so hard to get to where I am mentally: lots of meds adjustments and therapy and me working my butt off to change my thinking. Not to mention tacking an ADHD diagnosis on top of my anxiety and depression when I was a senior in high school, which also required adding more meds, and I crushed it. I am so proud of myself for that. 

But PTSD is the latest diagnosis and I feel like it has ruined me and set me so far back. I had to up my dose of SSRI‚Äôs. I‚Äôm back in intensive therapy - once or twice a week just to stay on track. My anxiety has a chokehold on me, and is combining with my ADHD to give me to worst anxiety paralysis of my life.

This happens in a split second, and it causes me to flinch and move my hand towards my face as to cover it. Every day it happens more frequently.

The thing is, I have never cut my face in such a manner. I did cut my index finger wide open about two years back, and I experienced similar flashbacks for a few days after the incident, but it hasn‚Äôt happened since.

Perhaps a bit of background would help:

I grew up in Mexico in a ‚Äúwar zone‚Äù between rival cartels, so I am no stranger to death and gore. I‚Äôd rather not get into details of things I saw growing up. Many of the friends I went to school fell victims to this violence, and less than half of the boys who were in my grade are still with us today.

I‚Äôm very introverted but I‚Äôve always been that way. 

Is it possible that my childhood is catching up to me? Are the flashbacks from the old cut on my finger coming back? Or is my brain simply messing with me?

"Feeling extremely isolated by gender  Obligatory my trauma does not invalidate or minimize your own experiences

I‚Äôm not sure where to start. I guess, it is just very hard living in a world in which not only is there so much of this made up divide between men and women, treated as a condition of nature rather than nurtured differences, but over and over culture reflects this portrayal of who harm doers and victims tend to be that absolutely contradicts my experience 

I feel doubly isolated, on one end for not being a woman as a victim, and yet even moreso by having had multiple traumatic experiences of abuse coming from multiple women. The men in my life have actually, still with flaws (mainly neglect/ a lack of communication), treated me quite well and been supports in my life, but I am at a point where I struggle to connect with women, despite (logically) knowing that we are all just people. I find myself much easier to let down my guard with men and nonbinary people, but for whatever reason when it comes to women I dissociate, I start seeing myself from an outside perspective as I so often had to with abusers who were *determined* to paint this stereotypical picture of them as some loving, kind person and me as some kind of instigator. I don‚Äôt want to, but I feel so much worlds apart that I miss out on being able to connect with people who otherwise I often feel I could have been great friends with. 

It especially can hurt even with women who are otherwise nice people, in that when it comes to things like abuse, I often find myself in a position where experiences like mine are minimized, where over and over I am expected to sympathize with a narrative that abuse is such a hard thing that *women* have to go through and fear from *men*. And I‚Äôm not stupid, I get that is the statistical majority and holds a different weight due to patriarchy influencing the dynamic, but I wish people realized that they don‚Äôt have to be so exclusive in discussions of gender, of abuse. And that gender doesn‚Äôt *only* play a role when it‚Äôs a man as a perpetrator and woman as a victim- each part of the puzzle just each comes with its own dynamic, and being a guy abused by a woman is still absolutely influenced in its own unique ways by gender dynamics. 

Idk, i have more to say but feel drained writing this, I want to speak from the heart about how this struggle has been sitting with me lately but I feel shut down by needing to filter as to not come off as some asshat MRA type. That need to filter so much in itself is ironically probably a big part of what I was getting at.

Rant. I'm just so sad. Honestly deep down inside of me a part of me is broken. I'm 23 and it happened when I was 9-14 years old. Why does the trauma still feel so fresh in my mind? It was almost every day and by my own flesh and blood. I wanna put his name out there. I hate knowing hes living his life having fun while I'm still suffering. When will there be justice?? Why's he still allowed to be out there. Why does it seem like everyone I know of who went through that got justice but me. I'm happy for them but what about me? I just wanna cry. üíî i was just a kid. my innocence was ruined and I'll never get that part of me back. ,ptsd

"How do I support my partner during flashbacks? My partner (22M) has C-PTSD and I (24M) wanna be there for him, but as of lately I've been feeling incredibly exhausted.

All of our relationship, I've tried my darndest to be understanding and supportive.
But flashbacks are easily triggered for him, and since a little over a year, when he is experiencing them, he's been telling me things like ""I am scared of you/that you will hurt me"" and worse stuff that I will not write here.

Even though I have never done anything at all.

I know that it's his trauma. I've tried talking about this in therapy. But I just don't know how to NOT be hurt by these, in my eyes, accusations hes throwing at me. I would never hurt him or do anything. I know it's not actually me he's scared of, but I cant look into his head. I'm just exhausted, and sad.

We had a talk today because it happened again and he shut me down and said I shouldnt make it about me. So I swallowed my feelings and just let him talk and explain what he means when he tells me these things.
I wanna try to get better at this, to not take it personally.

So my question is:
What's a good way to handle a situation like this? Is there a right way to support someone with C-PTSD? Is there a way to remove yourself from the situation (emotionally) when your partner is projecting their trauma onto you, as to not trigger them further?",ptsd
"I got into the nursing program but for the most part, I'm just really scared when I should be excited I wanted to be a nurse for a long time and I used to have the right personality for it, at least according to other people. When I told someone that I wanted to be a nurse, usually the response I would get is, ""You should totally be a nurse! Your patients would feel so special.""

I worked as a military medic (68W) for a few years and I never stopped caring about wanting to make a difference and being a source of comfort for people when they're feeling far from their best, but everything that happened between the first time I said I want to be a nurse and now made me lose that calming presence, I feel like. My body is always in hypervigilance mode to the point where people pick up on it and think they're making me uncomfortable. I'm always listening to every sound around me and watching every person around me, which makes it seem like I'm not paying attention. I've also been told that most of the time, I have an expressionless look on my face, which makes others think that I'm either bored, don't like them, don't want to be there, or all three. Last week, my neighbor called me out on giving her a ""thousand-yard stare.""

And then triggers are a whole other can of worms. I don't think I can ever forgive myself if something sets me off and yet another person suffers as a result of my incompetence.

I'm just really scared. I want to have hope. I want to have even a fraction of the positive attitude younger me used to have. I want to be the same annoying optimist that I was when I was a kid, but I'm starting to think that I'm damaged beyond the point of fixing!",ptsd
"Breakups igniting trauma TW: SA, Self Harm

I (24F) went through several sexual assaults through childhood, with one very severe one when I was 15 by a boy who was emotionally, physically and sexually abusive. I also had a terrible self harm problem from 11-16.

My ex bf and I had a 1.5year long live in relationship where we were very much in love, and even were planning to get married. I felt so safe and protected by him and have opened up to him about the intensity of my childhood trauma. He had always been kind, reassuring and soft. But his family didn't approve of me and he broke it off over a text message after promising me thousands of times that he'd convince them. They never met me - just that we were from different ethnicities so they disapproved and he couldn't stand up to them.

I just feel retraumatized and violated again, just like how I was as a child. I feel shame and guilt for trusting someone who treated me this way, in the same way I have trusted my abuser(s). How can I cope with this. I have felt ashamed for years and so guilty over my sexual assaults and now someone whom I thought I would spend the rest of my life with also did this, reigniting all of my trauma.",ptsd

"My Advice on Dealing with Explosive Emotions Like Anger | As a Medical Case Management Student with PTSD I originally shared this advice on someone‚Äôs post, but thought it might help more people. I hope this reaches those dealing with outbursts related to overwhelm. Remember, these are just symptoms‚Äînot reflections of your character‚Äîand you can lessen their impact over time.

Start by learning about yourself and recognizing the signs of overwhelm as they build. If you feel yourself escalating, it‚Äôs crucial to intervene before reaching a state of overwhelm. I struggle with this too‚Äîthrowing myself at objects, hitting, kicking, or clawing at anything. This isn‚Äôt because you‚Äôre violent; it‚Äôs because you deserved a break sooner.

When you‚Äôre in a positive headspace, write down comforting activities you can turn to when needed. Some can focus on the trigger (like journaling about your feelings), others redirect your attention (like playing a video game or watching a comforting show), and some allow you to expel energy (like using bilateral tapping or somatic shaking). You might also designate a safe, calm space for recovery or use physical remedies like hot pads, baths, or showers for tension relief. Herbal remedies, such as ginger and chamomile tea, have calming and anti-inflammatory effects. For those who use THC to manage symptoms, this tea can help soothe respiratory and sinus inflammation (though not as a cure or prevention for smoking-related illness). I recommend adding oat milk!

Personally, I created an emergency/self-care bag with items I know I‚Äôd want someone to give me when I‚Äôm overwhelmed: journals, a book, fidget toys (especially ones you can squeeze), and multiple pre-written emergency plans. I even customized my own journal prompts with help from ChatGPT to ensure they‚Äôre ready to use without needing to think them up when I‚Äôm overwhelmed. These plans outline the steps I expect myself to follow when disoriented by stress. Over time, these coping skills become automatic as your brain recognizes the pattern and knows it‚Äôs time to take a break‚Äîjust like the last 20 times we practiced!

You deserve to feel better. Take steps to plan ahead and intervene sooner. You do deserve to feel okay. Your energy isn‚Äôt your fault; it‚Äôs your body‚Äôs way of trying to keep you safe. Let it know it‚Äôs safe in your hands by practicing self-care sooner. You got this! 

I look forward to your comments! Questions about the advice are welcome‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôll be finishing my bachelor‚Äôs in medical case management this year, so I understand how to live with, manage, and find resources for these challenges‚Äîfrom both an advocacy/resource allocation perspective and a patient perspective.",ptsd

When I was 9 my dad SA me it happened a handful of times but not enough to be a daily situation. He would get drunk a lot, I haven‚Äôt spoken to him in almost 10 years after my mother moved with my at stepdad to a different city. I then opened up to my therapist about the SA and they told my mom and she told all her family including my stepdad. I disliked him when I was younger because he insisted he wanted to be my father so bad. The word father has so many good and bad connotations to it, I had one dad and he fucked it all up in my mental. I was celibate due to (said matters) but my stepdad always insisted in creating a vulnerable connection with me and him.

My mom worked in peek morning hours so that when we came back from school she would be there.

"Moving on with Medical Trauma This is a bit strange but I would like advice. I have been told by a couple of previous therapists ( who were lovely, but I can no longer see due to moving states, which was very planned and a great growth moment) that I likely have medical trauma. I was, and am, a bit in denial about it because it seems strange? For a brief tldr, I was extremely over medicated for about 7 years in my teenage years and early 20s that caused some severe side effects, most notably very debilitating pain. I still have very strong reactions in doctors offices, often involving crying fits or simply avoiding them, and for the first two year after the rumination was constant, but I am since doing better.

A major issue I'm having, and this feels ridiculous to say, is I cannot get over an enormous sense of dread when I do more than dip my toes into the art world. I majored in art and was preparing for a career in it, but the association with the sickness was so strong that I can't really do it to this day? I don't want a career in it, but it was the core of who I was for so long and brought me so much joy, I would kind of like it back.

I am unsure of what else to do. First and foremost, I don't understand how I can be this haunted by some pills. Second, it makes treatment complicated. I am on an antidepressant still, but have been out of therapy a year. I am starting to wonder if trauma focused therapy may be good, but I'm perfectly functional outside of some bad days, and I don't know if EMDR would work since there is no specific events, just 7 years of little terrible shit for no reason.

I want to know if anyone has dealt with anything similar and has tips for learning to enjoy the things I associate with it again.",ptsd

"People who didn't see their trauma, what are your flashbacks like? Trigger warning - sexual assault

Two years ago, I was raped by a friend of mine and developed severe PTSD, which still has a big impact on my life. 

My assault happened while I was asleep, I woke up during it, but now I have a massive fear of sleeping. Most of my panic attacks and flashbacks happen while in bed, so I take medical cannabis to help me sleep and haven't fallen asleep unaided in two years.  

When I get flashbacks, if I am awake, they are usually more 'feelings' or physical sensations, rather than  visual. When I am in bed and trying to sleep, I get the physical sensations, but also I get more of the 'classic' kind of flashbacks that are very visual and feel very real. 

The only thing is that they aren't usually identical to what actually happened. For example, this week I was trying to sleep and had my eyes closed. All of a sudden, I felt someone's hands on me (the same way as irl), then I heard a whisper in my ear, then I got a flash of his face on top of me (while my eyes were still closed & he didn't get on top of me in the assault) before I looked at him and he spoke to me, then I opened my eyes and had a full on panic attack.

In our friend group we like to crack a lot of jokes which can be sometimes rely on very sensitive topics.

"How Can I Help  I'm in a class at school where a team of 4 I'm in are trying to create a business of some kind. We want to do non-profit and focus on SA/rape. We were wondering what kind of invention/organization/resource you think would be helpful to survivors after the fact or in preventing before-hand. I hate rape culture and I would love nothing more than to eradicate it, but I know I can't make a whole cultural shift. So what small thing can I do to reduce the number by even 1?

"Crazy in the morning Do you feel worse in the mornings right after waking up?

I feel so overwhelmed with life. But it's always worse when I wake up. It's hard to describe. It's like there is a thunder cloud over mij head raining doom and gloom upon me. I feel shivers. I need to hold on to my teddy bear real tight and keep my eyes closed in order to not panick. I need to lay completely still. The images, remarks, sounds, things that were said all replay in my mind and make me feel super sad to the point where I feel like I need to vomit because it's just too much. It's this overwhelm of hopelessness and despair that comes with seeing another day and realising this is my life now. 

In the evening right before bedtime it's a bit better. Falling asleep is the best part of my day.

"Gambling as a Coping Mechanism for PTSD Hello, I first want to say thank you for reading my post. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place but I wanted to write my experience and see if anyone has been down the same road as me. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD & Gambling Disorder after beginning addiction treatment for gambling. I began weekly sessions with a psychiatrist in July to begin to address my addiction with gambling. In relation to PTSD, my psychiatrist has told me I relied heavily on gambling as a coping mechanism for trauma stemming from child abuse. Notably my relationships were strained and dying as I would withdraw & shutdown when I needed to communicate. I‚Äôve been working on communicating my feelings and trusting people I care about to show me empathy again. 

I want to ask if anyone else has experienced the high of gambling in that it removed the feeling of being scared? For me it allowed me to feel big in a world I felt so small in. I was scared of being judged and I still am, but now I take a deep breath and ground. I am a good person. I am trying to learn because I deserve to be happy. I make this post because I want to see if anyone has experienced this relationship with gambling as a coping mechanism too. Thank you again for your time. ",ptsd

"I sometimes feel like I didn't go through enough to have PTSD, but I still feel the symptoms CW: Mentions of SA, CSA

This is something that I've never allowed myself to confess. I have been very hesitant about saying I have PTSD, even in therapy and with a psychiatrist I've seen, I have been hesitant to brig up the idea I might have it. I was bullied heavily in kindergarten until 8th grade, I'm a survivor of CSA, and a SA in high-school by a close friend. What was even more triggering was reporting that SA to my school, being forced to tell my parents in order to report it, and then speaking out to the school board about how the school mishandled my case, only to have my small town turn their backs on me and have the guy spread lies about me through the whole school and town. Some people called me brave, I still don't feel brave. I feel used and regretful, I can't meet anyone from my highschool or town without being sent into a panic and wondering if they believe the lies that were spread about me. 

About once every few months, I google PTSD and CPTSD, and search through the symptoms. So much of it applies to me, but I have a voice in the back of my head telling me that I didn't go through enough to have it, or that I'm just playing the victim. I tell myself that I'm using the idea as an excuse for why I haven't amounted to much in my life. 

But I'm just left wondering that what if why I'm like this, is because of my trauma and my inability to entertain the idea that I could be struggling more than I thought. The idea that what happened to me did affect me, even years later. ",ptsd
"I don‚Äôt know what to do Hello, 
I have PTSD along side many other things. I have been struggling with my mental since senior year of high school( 2 years) and it‚Äôs just getting worse and worse. Now I am depressed all the time, i feel numb but my body wants to cry. I feel emotionally unsafe in my home( i live with my family) because they have done so much stuff to me. Luckily i have a safe place where i go 2 days a week. My teachers and my mental health team(CCS) is really all the support i have. I have been so dissociated and numb lately that i can‚Äôt express my emotions. I have been trying to express my emotions to my teachers( out of the 5 of them I only really trust 2 of them) but I am so good at hiding it that it‚Äôs hard. 
I really want to tell my teacher that I am struggling in the moment but I can‚Äôt, I am to afraid of being a burden and wasting her time. Now me and this teacher have a very strong relationship, she has been there for me always. I think what I am most afraid of me starting to cry and not being able to talk, now i could text or email her but same issue I don‚Äôt feel safe enough to cry at home. I think i told her last week about my parent issues. But i think i was dissociated. The reason why i am bringing this up is because my IEP is coming up and my parents will be there, and i am scared. I don‚Äôt know what to do.  I can‚Äôt hold in my emotions for much longer. I am wondering if I should make myself upset and tell her or tell her and risk crying?
There are some other questions I have:
The first question I have, is there such a thing as PTSD episodes? I also dissociated 

This question goes a long with the first question, can you get traumatized by this episodes?

The third question I have, when dissociating can you hear or is the brain completely shut down?

Another question I have is can you have a panic attack while you dissociated? When I come out of a dissociative state i feel like i can‚Äôt breathe for a couple seconds. 

I just hate being a burden and I know my teacher is on my side and cares about me and wants me to communicate with her. But that‚Äôs the thing I feel bad because I care about her also. 
Sorry for the long post. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. ",ptsd

"Severe problems with communicating and socializing  So about a year ago I left a toxic relationship, I was stalked, and I was treated like shit by my immediate family afterwards because they didn't believe me

After all that happened, I started to socially withdraw and isolate, which was extremely out of character for me because I used to be the most cheery, extroverted person

Over the last year I became more and more anxious/depressed, which caused me to isolate more, which caused me to feel even worse, it was a vicious cycle and now I'm in a hole I can't get out of. I abandoned all my hobbies and stopped talking to basically everyone for so long that I can't even remember who I am anymore. Its almost impossible now for me to function normally or talk to anyone because I've forgotten all of my personality traits, opinions, stories...it's like I'm an empty husk with nothing left to offer the world 

I struggle HARD with talking to people, even if i just need to interact quickly when im buying something at a store. I can't even talk to my own family because I don't feel like I can relate to anyone anymore. I'm just quiet and timid all the time. And as I mentioned earlier I've stopped talking to all of my friends too - 
the main reason is because im ashamed of what ive become and i know i cant live up to the happy, extroverted person i used to be anymore. I'm so quiet and lonely now and it feels like ive disappeared

It's been affecting my job too, I've been calling in sick more and more because I can't handle being around people - I'm always scared I'll be too quiet and make it weird, or say the wrong thing and make it even more weird/awkward. There have been times I've been scared I'll lose my job, which is just another source of stress now

Has anyone else dealt with this? Does it ever go away? I'm so lost, I don't know how to help myself.I had more hope before but it only seems to be getting worse as time goes by :( 

Thank you so much if you took the time to read this. If anyone has any insight or advice I would be so grateful üíï",ptsd
"Traumatic incident a couple days ago, struggling to cope My partner called 911 because they were having a mental health crisis. 

On multiple occasions, cops in my neighbourhood have shot or killed people who look like my partner during mental health checks, under very similar circumstances. My partner was unarmed and no threat to anybody.

Cops showed up with paramedics, but the cops forced their way into my home without consent or any conversation. Barricaded me in the bathroom and cornered my partner in our living room, hands on holsters. They were extremely hostile and aggressive and I fully believed I was about to watch a murder. They accused my partner of having a knife, which was completely false and there was no reason to think that. At no point did they ask any standard question for mental health first responders. I begged them over and over to leave so we could all stand outside and have a calm conversation with the paramedics. After a long standoff they finally agreed, then they barricaded us again in the hallway. I put my body in between my partner and the cops and just calmly asserted over and over that we could all speak outside. I knew one wrong move and I would be arrested and my partner would be brutalized or killed. I kept telling the cops that they were escalating needlessly and making us fearful but they wouldn‚Äôt listen until finally the paramedics intervened. 

I‚Äôve been having flashbacks all day, I can‚Äôt sleep normally and I keep imagining what would‚Äôve happened if either one of us had panicked. I‚Äôm so angry at the police. Please don‚Äôt engage if you‚Äôre going to defend that racist, murderous gang of power-hungry, armed bullies that are licensed to terrorize my neighbourhood and my loved ones. They are notorious around here and this is just one example. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. ",ptsd
"Why am I so stressed at night? Hi. I'm Mark. It's 10:23 pm. I'm in my car trying to sleep. I'm 19 and escaped my parents several months ago. Horribly abusive people. Looking at their faces haunts me. Sets off a fight or flight response. I'm genuinely terrified of my parents. I finally blocked them on all socials along with half my family, who thinks what they did to me was the right thing to do.

I have 9 sisters and 1 brother. Most of my sisters believe I deserved to be tied up and beaten. I deserved to have my hands tied behind my back with duct tape and kicked around the garage floor while my father is laughing. I deserved to be tied to a bench press and beaten with a wooden spoon by my smiling father while my mom watches for a minute in the background, leaves, and lets my father finish. I deserved to have my father grab a knife and yell at me, telling me that it's time for me to die. I deserved to have my face painted like a clown by him, so he could force me to clean the house while all my siblings laughed at me. This barely scratches the surface of what my parents have, in their free, fully functioning, completely sane minds, and free, completely uncompromised will chosen to do to me. 

I don't know what I did. I wish I could say I was sorry. For what?? I don't know! If I hurt someone, I didn't mean to. What did I do to deserve it? I really don't know. I wish I deserved it. I know I have autism and ADHD, and that they are associated with emotional dysregulation, so I was prone to temper tantrums. But every kid has meltdowns! Why am I the one who gets brutally assaulted by his parents? The one who gets spanked bare-skinned by a metal spatula? The one who gets hit as hard as possible multiple times by a belt by his father, a former football player and soldier in the army? The one who has scissors placed around his finger while my father squeezes the scissors, threatening to cut off my finger? The one who has his room door taken off his hinges? The one who gets punched in the face and called a pussy because he's crying over geometry homework, and bleeds all over his homework?

It's all in the past now, but the damage is still there. I'm over it and I want to move on, but something is really off psychologically and physiologically. I know I have complex PTSD, but I've been experiencing something new lately.

This weird thing keeps happening at night. I'll suddenly start twitching or ticking and hyperventilating. I'll start screaming and crying. The craziest part? I'm not even thinking about my parents. I'm thinking about something completely chill and unrelated, yet I just feel so goddamn stressed during the most relaxing part of the day, when I'm safe in my car all snuggled up in blankets.

Why does this keep happening and only at night? During the day, I can talk about the past like it's nothing. At night, even the slightest mention of it makes me want to ball my eyes out and scream into the night sky.

I'm just so confused on how I could be thinking about super relaxing happy things, yet my body is just so stressed and high strung -- and this only happens at night. It's as if I have two minds, and my body reacts to the mind that I have no control of, the subconscious that is remembering the past. But I will have no idea what my body is remembering. I just feel super stressed, but I don't know what I'm so stressed about.

And now I feel less stressed after typing this all out on my phone, but I don't want to put my phone back down. I'm scared of my thoughts. I keep fidgeting and moving around. I just want to sit still and sleep. It's 11:13 pm and I'm still typing. I just want my thoughts to shut up for once in my goddamn life. 

Anyway, I just wanna know how it's possible that I feel so terrified at night when I'm just thinking about pleasant things, like projects I'm working on or the cool things I've done today. 

I spend a lot of nights when I'm like this fantasizing about having someone to cuddle with, someone to place their hand on my face and kiss me, telling me everything is gonna be ok. But that's not gonna happen for a long time, and I want to know how you guys cope with this sort of thing when you're completely alone and isolated from everything you've ever known.

Sorry for the disorganized chaotic nature of this post. I'm going through another one of these ""episodes"" while I'm typing, so it's hard to think straight. Hopefully when I wake up tomorrow, I'll be able to respond in a better way. ",ptsd

"I feel like the most traumatizing thing to happen to me was pathetic. Context: When I was younger (7, I think), I got my period for the first time after being exposed to hormonal cream, but that's not the traumatizing part. They couldn't figure out what was wrong with me after a urine test, so they decided to do a blood test. Since I was little, I was terrified; what do you mean a random man is gonna stick a needle in my arm and steal my blood?! But one of my friends would reassure me that ""It's fine! I had some blood drawn when I was younger; it wasn't THAT bad!"" I believed her, of course. What else was I supposed to think? So, my mom drove me there and I was a little nervous, but not really. It'd just be like getting a shot, except instead of putting something in, they're taking something out. I got there, I got into my little hospital gown, whatever. I sat down on the bed-thingy and then the man came in. I don't remember the part up to it that well, other than them feeling my inner wrists and elbows (which I'll mention later) but I remember looking at my mom and closing my eyes tight since I didn't wanna see the blood. After he took the needle out, I was almost immediately smacked in the face with nausea and fatigue; I was a tiny little 7 year old girl, and getting even a little blood drawn drained me horribly. 

Now, why is this traumatic to me? Well, honestly? No clue. But the side effects of it are horrible. Not only did I immediately feel terrible, but only a few days later, my aunt, a nurse, checked out my veins, touched my inner wrists and elbows (I can't even touch them myself without letting out a sob) and said ""Ooh, you've got some nice veins!"" Little me was very uncomfortable and ran away into a corner to cry. But now, years later, I still can't even type this without tearing up; I'm crying right now actually. Can't talk about it; I'll cry. I saw a video where someone getting blood drawn was suddenly shown and I buried my face into a pillow and started crying. I read a book where someone got an IV and I had to put the book down because I was uncomfortable. Sometimes, I can feel the veins in my arms. It's very uncomfortable, if you were wondering; also a bit painful. Sometimes I even feel bad about how me being so terrified of getting my blood drawn means I can never donate it to people in need of it. Also, said friend who comforted me earlier said when I talked about it, ""Oh, I just got a lot more blood removed and I felt just fine. You'll probably feel better soon."" She said that to me about a week after I got it drawn. It's been years and I'm still caught up about getting only a little bit of blood drawn. I feel so pathetic; after all, some of you here have gone through horrors that no one should even have to think about, and yet here I am, crying over some old blood I got drawn. 

Also, they learned absolutely nothing from the blood test. It was completely useless.",ptsd
"Severe health anxiety  Do any of you guys have PTSD episodes triggered by health anxiety? I (21f) have diagnosed CPTSD due to being abused my entire life physically, sexually and emotionally, by many people including my family, and I have really bad health anxiety. The people who were meant to love and nurture me did the opposite. It‚Äôs to the point where I convince myself I‚Äôm dying, and then I physically feel like I‚Äôm dying and it‚Äôs like my mind becomes out of control and I become a feral animal. I act like a crazy person and scream and cry about how I‚Äôm dying and pull out my hair, normally I‚Äôm a very rational, calm and nonchalant person who struggles with expressing any emotion. It‚Äôs like I become possessed and start acting like a child, and it‚Äôs so embarrassing. I think it stems from never feeling safe in my body due to being abused and never having anyone care about me or protect me as a child, and feeling like I‚Äôm always in danger and something bad will happen to me. It‚Äôs so hard to deal with and so isolating. I currently have a bacterial sinus infection, and yesterday my symptoms got worse and I convinced myself I had meningitis and that I was going to die.

"Dreams.. advise and venting  I grew up with an abusive narcissistic father. I was kicked out/left at 18. I left behind my sister (15) she took on his abuse but was able to leave shortly after.

"I had an episode over mushrooms I(24f) just had my first real meltdown in front of my boyfriend. I was in an extremely abusive relationship that left me with debilitating ptsd. I have been doing a good job keeping it under control the past few years, in which I met my boyfriend (28m). We were making dinner tonight, and we realized we forgot the mushrooms at the checkout. He expressed slight disappointment because we swore we put it in the bags and the lack of mushrooms kind of messed up the recipe we were going for. I almost immediately was flung into an attack, terrified(unreasonably) that I would receive physical harm over the mistake, so I retreated to the bathroom. About three minutes passed and he realized I was gone, so he walked into the bathroom and found me curled up on the floor hyperventilating, completely unable to speak. He helped me calm down and was very gentle and understanding. However, I am feeling so much shame and guilt over the whole incident.

"What happened here? Tw: su1cide

Im rapidly approaching the one-year anniversary of my 35-year long bff's death by his own hand.  We lived some distance apart, so fb msgr was our primary means of contact.  We had talked approximately a week before his death on msgr, but then he fell off the grid, not reading or replying to followup messages i sent.

I tried to convince myself he was ok, even though he NEVER failed to respond the same or next day.  I knew in my gut something was off but kept trying to tell myself my anxiety was lying to me.  Then his son messaged me, advising he just found my bff hanging in his bedroom.  This was the single most traumatic, shocking, and crippling thing that ever happened to me, and it took me several weeks to get past the hardest grief, but it still hurts.  He passed Nov 8 last year.

So this month has been tough.. slightly more anxiety and a sense of foreboding, but I knew why and was fine.

This past Friday, another close friend I talk to daily (via text as he too lives rather far) and value a great deal told me he had a work event and would be quieter than normal that weekend.  I was grateful for him telling me.  He was able to message a couple times Saturday, but no responses on Sunday.  Or Monday.

  Monday night I started to get concerned, but not overly so.  I was chatting with another friend and noticed he didn't even OPEN something I sent him Sunday.  And I burst into tears, convinced he was gone, or in the hospital, unable to access his phone.  I tried all my grounding tools and nothing was helping.  I spent monday night in an utter panic, crying and unable to sleep.  Same Tuesday morning.  

I did hear from him Tuesday and he was fine, but... what the F happened here? Is this PTSD??? I'm not usually like this and would have assumed he was busy or tired from his trip... but I went off the deep end, going as far to open one of his social media pages to see if anyone posted he was gone.  

Im embarrassed now, and didn't see it coming. But the second I saw unopened messages, it was like all the pain and shock from last year was right back.

"I need advice really bad !  I‚Äôm M (22 years old). Two years ago, I ended a long relationship where I got cheated on, which really hurt. I moved into a different apartment (we lived together), started a job (I had been studying), and began working out again because I gained weight during the relationship. Over time, things improved‚ÄîI built a good physique, made money, and life was going fairly well.

Fast forward to April this year: I decided to apply for the Student Work and Travel program in the USA (I‚Äôm from Europe) for a summer job. I wanted a change of environment and to meet new people. Plus, I always wanted to visit the USA.

A month later, I arrived in the USA and met a girl, F (21). I really started liking her, and over time, I noticed she might like me too. Other people looked at us when we joked, and the girls gossiped about us. It took me 20 days to tell her how I felt because I was scared. She said she liked me too, and we agreed not to get attached since we were from different countries (though only 3-4 hours apart).

After some flirting, she finally kissed me. We had an amazing month and a half together. As time passed, I started wanting to continue our relationship after we went back, but I was scared to say it. One night, just before we left, she asked what we were doing afterward. I knew she wanted to continue, but I hesitated and said I needed time to think.

A few days later, I told her I wanted to keep talking, and she agreed. Then, a week before we left, we found out she was pregnant. We were in shock. After some time, I told her it was her decision to keep or terminate the pregnancy. She chose to terminate it, and I supported her but felt bad about it.

I started fearing she would leave me after that. I told her multiple times I was surprised she hadn‚Äôt dumped me. This made her angry, and she told me to stop repeating it. I couldn‚Äôt shake the fear of losing her, especially when she said she wanted space after the procedure.

Her birthday was 20 days ago, and I offered to visit her, but she needed time to detach from America due to feeling awful about what happened. She insisted it wasn‚Äôt about her feelings for me, but my anxiety worsened. I began checking her social media and became paranoid if she followed any guys. I knew it was unhealthy but couldn‚Äôt stop.

Arguments began almost daily over my overreactions. I noticed she was getting fed up, which only heightened my anxiety. Recently, she said she couldn‚Äôt continue like this, and I agreed, knowing I needed to work on myself. We parted on good terms.

Two days ago, she texted that she wanted to talk later. I panicked and asked if it was about another guy, which made her angry. She told me she couldn‚Äôt deal with my reactions anymore and called me selfish for focusing only on my feelings.

After reflecting, I realized she was right. I told her she gave me a reality check and wanted to talk. She said we weren‚Äôt on bad terms, but I felt like we were. I asked again what she wanted to tell me, but she hasn‚Äôt replied yet.

I feel awful for causing her stress. Friends from the USA have asked about her because she isn‚Äôt replying to anyone. I know I‚Äôve put her through too much emotional turmoil.

At this point, I don‚Äôt want to get back together because I need to fix my past trauma and anxiety first.

**If anyone has advice on how to manage my anxiety and fix my mindset, please help! Also, if there‚Äôs anything I can do to make her feel better, let me know.**

He pretended to be a police officer but couldn't produce a badge (and my mother wasn't a criminal). At this point my mother and I were pressing on the door to hold him back from opening it and screaming for help. I still remember screaming for help and being terrified.

Then, I guess, the man ran away in fear. (He left for some reason)

This incident caused me to be hypervigilent for years. I would pace around at night looking for any signs he was back again.. *I feel like this trauma is unique.* Even though most of my childhood trauma involved my mom abusing and neglecting me, this was a whole nother kettle of fish.

Hi, first of all I don't know I have PTSD but something that I'm really sure if that I do have traumas, I think that one of the first ones was when my neighbors killed my cat when I was just a kid, but tonight I'm over thinking about a robbery that happened in 2016, long story short 4 or 5 guys emptied our house and since then I think I've been or feel like one of the soulless human that ever existed (I know that it's really exaggerated but that's how I feel) and well the political situation of the country is not helping at all (I live in Venezuela) so... Yeah that's it of course there's more but what I was trying to say is that I can't sleep and I have classes in a few hours and I'm here over thinking and if I'm not over thinking I just can't sleep, I would be happy if I had tons of drugs like benzos or opioids to stop feeling and being numb all the time but well it seems that I will have to thug it out for the rest of my life cuz I can't even pay a therapist :) if I spelled something wrong let me know because as you see is not my first language.

"Depressed and Pushing Therapist Away? TW: suicide, self harm, SA

A brief background: I (36f) have PTSD from a sexual assault many years ago, and the anniversary is coming up on Saturday. There‚Äôs a lot of other stuff going on for me, too, and, in the last six weeks, I‚Äôve gotten incredibly depressed, have mood swings and severe irritability, I started cutting myself which I haven‚Äôt done in 15 years, I‚Äôm behaving fairly erratically, I have zero impulse control, and the suicidal ideation has been frequent. It‚Äôs been a rough time, to say the least. 

I‚Äôve been working very closely with my therapist of six years throughout this depressive episode, and she‚Äôs amazing. But I‚Äôve suddenly started getting really angry with her, and lashing out, and just starting to feel really resentful and bitter and directing it at her, for no particular reason, which is definitely new. I‚Äôm clearly subconsciously trying to push her away but I couldn‚Äôt figure out why. 

And then it hit me.

The main reason I haven‚Äôt acted on my suicidal thoughts is because I have to imagine that a therapist losing a client to suicide has got to be incredibly, deeply traumatizing and I can‚Äôt do that to her. And I think on some level, I want to push her away so that I‚Äôll be able to do whatever I want without guilt. I really don‚Äôt think I have it in me to go through with anything, thankfully, but I think part of me still wants to purge anything and everything keeping me from going through with it, starting with my therapist. 

I don‚Äôt even know that I have a specific question here. I guess I just want to know if anyone else can relate to this, and what you did if you found yourself in a similar situation? Obviously I will talk to my therapist, but I still feel angry with her, and bitter and resentful toward her, even though I know it‚Äôs misplaced and she hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong. So what do I do with those feelings? Ignore them? Channel them somewhere else? Keep directing them at her but tell her why I think I‚Äôm doing it? I have no clue. But the emotions are intense and my subconscious really wants to direct it at her, and I feel really bad about that. And I really don‚Äôt want to actually push her away, because I definitely need her support right now. ",ptsd

"Quest for Validation I am healing from the past two years of chronic physiological abuse from a former friend/neighbor.  Due to us being neighbors, the abuse was constant and me and my family were constantly living jn fear.  This person is a mentally unstable malignant and highly covert narcissist that over the years had drew us in thru brilliant manipulation.  When we finally received their final soul crushing blow I had no choice but to pack up my beautiful home, leave my historically low interest rate, rip my kids from their friends and schools, leave my job and move as far away as I could.

Currently I am in sort of a protective custody type life trying to pick up the pieces of my shattered life.  My entire family is in therapy and I suffer from terrible PTSD, nightmares, screaming in my sleep, major mood swings, times of intense rage, memory loss and time perception issues and a slew of physical issues caused by the extreme stress for so long.  I hadn‚Äôt slept a full 8 hr night in 13 months.  My career is hanging on by a thread.  My children get horrific hate messages from the kids at their old school because of the slander and defamatory lies that the neighbor has spread from us causing their narcissistic injury and leaving.

Ok‚Ä¶ sorry about all that, just had to lay context.

All my therapists tell me there is not way that I will ever receive closure from this person for all the trauma they have inflicted.  That I should not confront the narcissist and ‚Äúmove on‚Äù.  There is nothing I can think of that I feel would bring me more peace than to try to explain to this person what they have done.  I know it won‚Äôt change the past and the narcissist being the narcissist literally will not accept blame of any kind.

My therapist then told me to start writing on this platform to help me process and accept things so here I am‚Ä¶.

How can I go on without some tiny insignificant form of justice or validation be achieved.  I feel it will just boil inside me forever.

"I am diagnosed with PTSD, I'm 17. What do I do with my life? I'm sorry if the English is bad. I'm sorry if this is too long, this is my first time using Reddit to post. Thank you

When I was 16, I was raped by my then gf (now ex), and it's still affecting me now; to the point where my psychiatrist diagnosed me with PTSD now at 17. I didn't know it was SA back then because I assumed that it was just a normal occurrence to feel the kind of naked shame after the act. It felt like I committed a sin, maybe because I am Christian, but I feel dirty even until now. I've developed a severe rash from scratching myself because I have this itch from some dirt beneath my skin or idk how to explain im sorry. But essentially, she forced herself onto me because it was an ""expected thing"" from relationships, I didn't say no, but I didn't say yes either. I don't know, maybe it was my fault for not saying no.

The problem is that it is starting my academics and organization responsibilities. She's the school government president and I'm one of the school government officers; there have been times where I've skipped school to avoid seeing her, or just crying and breaking down during an online officers meeting because of her voice. My grades have been slipping too. 

I talked to my guidance counsellor about this, and it was going really well. Until they essentially forced me to talk to her (as in, I was crying and begging to not talk to her but they literally physically grabbed me and dragged me into the guidance room where she was crying). During the meeting, she was crying. She essentially said that ""if you said no, I would have respected that. If you resisted, I would have stopped. But you didn't."" And she was crying a lot, she doesn't want to be called a rapist because it apparently feels like she is evil. I had to stop crying so I could say what I wanted.

The teachers in the meeting decided not to suspend her, to protect her and me - and I was put on leave from doing any school org responsibilities. She is now paying for my new medication and covering for my sessions. But I still have this anger inside me. I feel like shit everyday and even just seeing her happy (i. dont. care. if she is faking it) or just her profile on social media - I have a panic attack and I cry for hours until I fall asleep. 

She just seems so happy, as if nothing happened. She is still the school government president, it was ME that had to adjust. She still has everything. I tried everything, but I'm starting to think that it was better off if I never opened up at all. I want her to die, to suffer, to have EVERYONE in the school know what she did.

My mother and psychiatrist told me to use this anger as a motivation for success. That the best way to get revenge is to be successful and move on. But it's so hard that I'm starting to consider ending my life, because by then I would know that people would actually take my death seriously and take her accountable for her actions.

"My counselor left the counseling company. I'm trying to decide if still need counseling. I've been with this counselor for about 2 1/2 years. When I started I was having panic attacks several times a week. Now, panic attacks are rare. I have days my anxiety is heightened but I do things I know that lowers my anxiety without taking a pill. Four weeks ago the counselor told me he was leaving. I have no idea where he's going or if he will still do counseling. He asked if I still wanted to have counseling and I said yes. We went through a series of questions to hopefully match me with a new counselor I like. 

Fast forward to today, it was our last session. I haven't heard from the company about a new counselor and he acknowledged that, and said they will contact me but he doesn't have any information beyond that. But he also softly suggested that I might not need counseling anymore. I have a good support system and know how to lower my anxiety. 

So now I'm contemplating whether I should still attend counseling or not. I'm afraid I won't like a new counselor. My life is mostly settled. I take Cymbalta but it's not just for anxiety, it also helps keep my neuropathy pain mostly in check. Yes, Cymbalta helps with nerve pain. My life was unlivable before Cymbalta because of pain. Now I can do daily tasks as long as I don't overdo activities that require a lot of walking and standing.  For context I live in NYC and don't own a car. So everywhere I go requires a significant amount of walking.

"Massive panic attack during foreplay CW: Sex, rape, sexual abuse, humiliation, degradation, suicide, physical abuse, mental abuse

Last night, I was about to have sex with my girlfriend and everything went horribly wrong. 

In the past I have seen and gone through lots of rough periods in my life. I have witnessed events that someone my age should never have to go through. The most recent is from about 6 years ago and the earliest one is 15 years ago. I am now 27 and things are getting worse and worse. Let's get started:

12 years old: I saw my best friend jump in front of a train. The day before that he told me he wouldn't commit suicide and that he didn't want to leave me behind, but that day, after it happened, I came home to a message on my phone saying: ""I am sorry but it's my only way out, my dad just beat me up and raped my brother, I can't do this anymore.""

18 years old: my dad fell down 5 meters and broke a lot of bones and shattered his hip, my mom had a deadly intestine infection, my brother got arrested for street robbery and my parents got extremely physically abusive. 

I came out as trans to my parents, got bullied for it by my parents, berated, physically abused, threatened (death threats) and all my girl stuff got broken by my mom. As I found the stuff she was standing in my door opening, saying: ""if you want to be a girl, than you should learn to clean like a girl""

19 years old: I saw a motor driver lose control of his bike. I was the first one at the place, saw how injured he was, had to take care of him till the the ambulance came. Before he passed out, I asked for his parents phone number. Later on, police was questioning everyone, I told them I had their phone number and they nodded. 15 minutes later they told me to call his parents and tell them that he may not survive. His parents screamed, cried, had mental breakdowns and lost all hope. 

A couple of weeks later, a random guy jumped in front of a train at Amsterdam Sloterdijk. I saw him being ripped apart, just like my best friend back in the day. 

22 years old: I was dating a girl, she always insulted my sexual achievements, wouldn't cuddle and even once gave me a concussion, by repeatedly hitting my head. The day after, she asked me for sex. I refused and went on with my day. She drugged my food/drink with Viagra and raped me that night. I woke up to her riding me and threw her off me and slept somewhere else. The next day, I left the place and she chased me with a knife, yelling: ""if I can't have you, nobody will"" she dashed at me, I took her arm, broke it and ran away. 

Last night, everything came at me at once.

I was about to have sex with my girlfriend, we just had a lovely time of cuddling and I was hard as rock. She got ready to get on me and the moment that she did, I collapsed. My mind replaced her face with my ex's face and I could hear all the words she ever said to degrade me loud and clear in my head. 

I collapsed in my girlfriend's arms. She cuddled me and made sure I was safe. At that moment, I had the worst thing ever happen to me: all the trauma that I have in my life came back at once. I felt everything, I saw everything, I heard everything. All the emotions, all the insults, all the screams and at the end of it all, I was left in the worst state I have ever been in in my entire life. I never felt worse. 

Today, I am feeling like utter shit. I can't recover from this today and idk when I will. I can't have a psychiatrist yet, since I just moved to another country and am not a full citizen yet. I need help and idk what to do. 

Please tell me how I can deal with this. What helps and what doesn't. I am desperate and need all the help I can get. ",ptsd

"Recalled a uniquely awful interaction with an ex. CW: idek, forced voyeurism? I have no idea how to process it I was dating a guy two years older than me. He lived with his parents, where he helped take care of his two younger siblings that are both disabled. This was a long time ago, and far be it from me to offer a diagnosis, but all I really remember is that they were both wheelchair bound with breathing tubes and required assistance for all tasks. Neither could communicate. I thought it was sweet he was helping his parents while going to college. Turns out nothing is sacred.

I showed up during breakfast time, he finished seating his siblings and began making eggs. I stood nearby, leaning against the cupboard behind me. Making conversation with me, he started flirting a bit and grabbing me sexually. I pushed back from him kissing me and made it known that I was profoundly uncomfortable going that far with PDA in front of his siblings as they were 13 and 10. He pushed back, and basically implied that his siblings were so disabled that they wouldnt know whats going on and they dont count as people watching??? I can't remember the exact conversation, but I know his face got dark and he grabbed me harder. I'm very little. He easily picked me up by my left leg and my throat, slamming me against cabinet I had just been leaning on moments ago. 

That's the flashbulb. Not being able to breathe, my ears ringing, head hurting, hip hurting, his forceful kiss, his awful breath, all while I made eye contact with his little brother over his shoulder.

Hi all. I am diagnosed PTSD and last week I had a ""that's enough slices"" moment. I am venting, and I use humor to cope, so prepare for that. 

My former job, starts with a W, ends with ""almart"", decided that a misscan on ONE transaction i made off the clock at another store was enough to get me arrested for theft. Yes, that is literally what I said. It was a normal day up to that point and I was doing my freight, till I was told to come back to office.

 Per policy it's supposed to happen in the office closest to the doors, which is the courtesy they give to people who are actually stealing, doing drugs in the bathrooms, etc. Oh no. I was perp walked through the entire store, having to tell the cop where to go because he had no idea, while in cuffs. I later learned from close friends that Coaches (supervisors) were mocking me after I left by pretending to walk with cuffs. I have nothing on my record, not even a speeding ticket, and they've RUINED this part of me.

Don't worry though, they told me I'm allowed the continue to shop there... No thank you.

I think everyone has wished they could go back to when they're younger to fix whatever problems or trauma they've had in the past, but I used to pray for it every single day between teen years and my thirties, and get extremely upset when I woke up. For decades. If I could just go back to being 8 and take everyone's advice to stay away from her. Is that common, or, at least, common for people with PTSD?

"Nothing, in fact, happened, but I am so scared  I am not sure what I have is PTSD or anything else. I have posted here before (ended up deleting after people telling me I was overreacting and that my problem was ""phone addiction"") and shared the story with family members and friends but no one seems to take me seriously.

I was robbed last week with no violence. It all happened very very fast and thankfully no physical damage.

I really have no emotional attachment to my phone or any personal belongings, but my phone was UNLOCKED. This means the guy had access to all of my apps containing all of my date for about two hours, until I was able to make it home to remove the device from my Apple account. He had access to conversations I had with my husband, my therapist...

He went through my social media (I am not guessing, he really did). He went through my food delivery apps (where my address/work address was saved, but also the address of plenty of friends and family members) and ordered a bunch of shit in my account (obviously to a random address, not to his address). He saw my pictures (no nudes but it really hurts me that he had access to pictures of my family, of me, of my passport, of my id, etc). He knows who I am, he knows where I live. He knows the gym I go to. He knows where I work. He knows my thoughts, even, because I always enjoyed writing and leaving stuff in my Notes. He got to know my entire life in those few hours, and I am so scared of leaving the house.

Everyone says its nothing personal and he does not give a damn about me because he steals 50 phones daily. I know that (rationally). But as someone who was stalked before (I was a 15 yo  stalked by a random guy at school and this caused A LOT of emotional pain) I am very easily triggered and since this guy had access to my entire life, I got super scared.

Not sure this is PTSD, though, or ""simply"" anxiety and constantly being on alert state.

I am exhausted and I am having a very hard time concentrating at work. I am easily confused, get lost in time & space, get easily distracted, my house is a mess, I am late to everything. Its like I went to therapy for years to become a better version of myself and recover from creepy high school stalker and now I am scared of going back to the same place.

PS: I don't mean to offend anyone because I know some people go through stuff that are 100x worse than this, I am not trying to say I have been through the worse thing ever and I am not even trying to affirm that I have PTSD... I just want advice, really.",ptsd
"Cold shivering trauma Hi. I had a traumatic event in a hike 2 years ago. I was reaching a mountain summit a little bit after sunset, and I was running late, as I should had been there already. The day had seen harsh weather, but its ending would be absolutely terrible. I was greeted by a heavy cold frontal rain that overcame my rain covers and left me soaking wet and cold at night. I had no energy left to warm up my body by walking and had to still set up the tent, make food and sleep. Luckily I was in a group that helped me, and we managed to pull through. I used my emergency blanket to warm up as quickly as possible and tucked inside my sleeping bag. I had never felt so much cold in my life.

Shivering, I slept, and the night was luckily calm. The morning sun had never been so welcome, and it helped me dry everything and depart in not such a miserable state as I was during nighttime.

Anyway, I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to this day back then. I thought it was just a mishap, something that can happen to anyone.

But I started to notice that it changed my life without me even realizing. Now, I always carry an extra piece of clothing, and I usually don‚Äôt feel as hot as the people around me. That seemed okay, maybe I just learned to play a little on the safer side?

Yeah, but the problem is I absolutely can‚Äôt stand the cold anymore. Any cold at all. I get out of a shower to a cold bathroom in a hotel? - I get shivers, a metallic taste in my mouth and flashbacks to the night. It is paralyzing to a point where I have to drop everything and seek warmth immediately. I feel like if I don‚Äôt, I could pass out and die.

I can‚Äôt even go into a swimming pool anymore. Getting out of it is just so harsh to my body that I pass the experience altogether.

Anyone else has experienced something like this? I don‚Äôt know what I can do to make it stop. Sorry if it‚Äôs a small problem compared to other stories I read here. Cheers.",ptsd

"Medical trauma - trigger warning, heavy topics  
TRIGGER WARNINGS - mentions of heart failure, hospital monitors, etc. idk if that might be triggering for some people so thought I‚Äôd mention just in case. Please don‚Äôt read ahead if this is a sensitive topic for you. Sorry idk if this belongs in this subreddit. 

So not to get too personal, but I have a lot of immense medical trauma from having a family member with severe heart failure who flatlined for 4 seconds, who luckily got a new heart. I was a senior in college, and this happened my last semester. It was one of the hardest moments of my life. I had so many panic attacks, I even had a panic attack in class because we were covering heart failure which hit too close to home because of all the damn stress. I was so embarrassed. I lost so much weight too. Just a constant feeling of doom, not knowing whether today they may not make it, not knowing what tomorrow will bring. And I kept getting worse and worse news. Having no support from friends, having to tough it out to not burden them and look too negative. Because when I opened up a little bit they didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt realize how much trauma my body held from this. 

But I have another sick family member now, and I‚Äôm so scared. It triggers me seeing the flashing of the hospital monitors. When they beep, and there‚Äôs a warning of one of their vitals being too high or low. When you have to wait in suspense for some news, hoping that it isn‚Äôt bad. My heart rate shoots up super high. It‚Äôs just one thing after another. I‚Äôm going crazy. I just can‚Äôt handle this anymore. I‚Äôm an anxious mess. I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about this. ",ptsd
"What this spouse endures from his non vet wife who suffers from severe PTSD. 

What it is like to live with a spouse who has severe PTSD. First, I would like to state that I am writing this because neither myself or my wife are veterans. It seems like all the research I do almost always involves a veteran. Plus, it never really addresses what the non PTSD spouse goes through on a daily basis. You are going to need some background first.

First though, you need to know recent shit. My wife was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, on August 31, 2024, stage IV, which has metastasized to her brain, bones and liver. She had surgery on her brain first. That tumor had already grown to 1.61x1.81x1.22 **inches** in size, there were a couple of small ones in other regions of the brain. She then had three bouts of targeted radiation. Then she started receiving the immunotherapy drug Keytruda as well as what will end up being 10 doses of targeted radiation on the incredibly large mass in her lung, that has grown into her rib cage, has ossified her first and second rib and has also invaded her liver which has two smaller ones. She has 5 treatments down, weekend off, then the last 5. By the way, that bastard measures 3.98x2.4x1.46 **inches**!

A typical female liver averages 8.5‚Äù long, hers is 13.5‚Äù? Is the extra 5‚Äù good or bad? Can the doctors do a resection of the tumor and leave her enough to live? I read somewhere that the liver will regrow.

I understand why she should be extremely tired, cranky and just bitchy all around. Then factor in her PTSD and her lack of being able to show (just me) any love, sympathy, empathy, anything that shows even a marginal of care for me.

Okay, here comes a shit load of numbers,(for no real benefit). I like numbers because they don‚Äôt lie. Math is math. For the duration of my time on this planet, 62 years, 4 months, 3 weeks and 4 days, (22,794 days), I have been married for 36 years, 2 months, 1 week and 6 days, (13,223 days). Today, October 18, 2024 has without question been the worst day of my life. I know that what she is saying to me is not her. But she was extremely vicious and dug deep to just crush me.

I was completely devastated. My heart, soul and just being were shredded, I told her I was going to bed while trying to hold back my emotions. When I got to my room I just had to let it out for about 5 hours. I had so many tears just streaming down my face I thought I was going to dehydrate.

Never felt that, ever. I was heavily physically and mentally abused when I was young, and nothing my mother ever did to me made me feel as I felt last night. This woman was cruel, evil, soulless, an alcoholic and was born without a purpose in life

Now, for the rest of the story‚Ä¶

My wife was a Para Teachers Assistant, (we used to call it special ed). She loved her job and was damn good at it. She worked for one of the local high schools, and the vast majority of these kids are never going to function in society. So many of them had no verbal skills, arrived by a special van with a nurse and could not even sit up or even move. I think the parents looked at it like state sponsored day care and just wanted a break from it all. The schools looked at it like a lot more money for trying to ‚Äúteach‚Äù these kids. Which in my opinion was futile, it really was all about the money.

Due to HIPPA laws she was not allowed to know anything about the kids. What exactly was their deficiency, their trigger points and their history? In September of 2020 she got the living shit beat out of her by one of these students. He was 6 feet tall and weighed about 200 pounds. He blew up in the classroom, threw one pregnant teacher across the room into the lockers, took a full grown man to the ground and then came at my wife. She did as trained and tried to talk him down until his handler could get there. He grabbed her and took her to the floor and the whole time was trying to bite her face, neck, whatever he could grab onto.

His handler shows up and gets him off of her and out of the classroom with my wifes help. She tells my wife that she is going to take off running and he will chase her. At that point my wife was to let go of him. When she did this he did not take off running but immediately turned on my wife and went back to try to bite her. My wife's fight or flight instinct did not have the time necessary to reset from the earlier attack. She has a hard time remembering how things happened, but she knows that she ended up on the floor again, and just trying to keep his mouth away from her body. He managed to bite her arm plenty deep enough to draw blood and she thinks she got kicked in the ribs at least a time or two before help came and got this kid off of her. Needless to say she was pretty shaken up and asked if she could go home. They let her do this and instructed her on where to go for medical treatment.

She arrived at home about 10:30 - 11:00 in the morning just hysterical, saying over and over ‚ÄúI got bit‚Äù.¬† I took her to the facility that the school said she had to go to and they treated her wound and rapped her ribs. They commented on how deep the wound from the bite was.

My wife tried to return to work the next day but after about an hour she had to leave. She did find out that she was the 22nd teacher that this student had assaulted. I think that that is information that should have been shared with anyone that was going to have interaction with him.

It has been over 4 years since the attack. She sees a therapist weekly and is making progress, slowly. For the longest time she could not be anywhere but home when it got dark. She can go to maybe half a dozen stores, all of which have a low concentration of people. She no longer cooks. I think there have been two meals she made since the beating.

I had an episode where for 5 nights in a row I was doing really weird stuff. Like waking her up in the middle of the night with my coat and shoes on asking her if she is ready to go? She of course wasn‚Äôt going anywhere but I swear she told me to take her somewhere, this happened twice. One night I had a quasi dream that I had to beat two other people to the kitchen because I wanted the bread and butter. I woke up in the kitchen alone. Another time I woke up flailing my arms falling backwards. I managed to pull the curtains down and woke up on the floor with the curtain rod across my face and the curtains sprawled about. The last time I woke up in extreme pain and falling backwards. I landed on a couple of computer monitors and a kerosene heater, in my closet. I figured out that in my sleep I slammed my face into the chest of drawers that were in there, broke my nose and woke up falling.

I went out and bought one of those sliding bolt locks for the bedroom door. I told my wife that after I go to bed to lock the door to the bedroom so I can‚Äôt get out of it because who knows what I might do. She refused to let this happen.

The next day I asked her to take me to the ER because I knew I couldn‚Äôt drive and she said she couldn‚Äôt. 3 - 4 hours later I came to her again and begged her to take me to the ER. I said I understand that she can‚Äôt come into the hospital with me, that she would if she could, but with how severe her PTSD is she would not be able to handle it. She could just drop me off and I would call her when I was done. So that is what we did. I ended up getting admitted, my blood oxygen level was 64% and the doctors and nurses were quite concerned. I knew I had COPD and it had progressed to this point rapidly. I now have supplemental oxygen 24/7 and for the most part I am doing ok about 80% of the time. The other 20% I feel like I am going to die because I just can‚Äôt catch my breath.

That is pretty much the back story, the following is what I go through daily. Let‚Äôs start with what I am either not allowed to say or do, and what she has said to me about how she feels:

* Not allowed to lay on couch
* Not allowed to say that I am tired
* Not allowed to say I had a rough night sleeping
* Not allowed to ask how her therapist meeting went. This I understand, she says it would be like asking her how her gynecologist exam went.
* I am not allowed to make telephone calls while in the same room as her
* I am not allowed to listen to music in the car or on the patio with her
* I am not allowed in any part of the house except my bedroom at times. She has taken up camp in the living room, sleeping in an oversized recliner.
* I am not allowed to comment on the amount of coffee she drinks, (12 - 15 cups a day) she says it doesn‚Äôt affect her. But most nights she gets 2 maybe 3 hours of sleep.
* If I try to talk to her while she is listening to a trial on Youtube with her earbuds in, I get a real disgusted ‚Äúwhat‚Äù from her.
* Anything important she can‚Äôt talk about right now.
* I am accused so many times of being a stressor to her
* She has told me that she can‚Äôt feel empathy for me right now, or love.
* She rarely shows me a sign of gratitude but will quickly point out something I did that stressed her or something that I didn't do and should have.
* She doesn‚Äôt care that her choice of isolation has also dictated a life of isolation for me.
* I figured out that I spend 22 hours a day on average in my room, she doesn't care.
* Today it dawned on me that I don‚Äôt care if she gets pissed off at me, but every time she has to slip in a good helping heap of fuckin guilt.¬†

There are so many more things, I used to have to text her when I was coming into the living room. This gives you a pretty good outline at least. I made a list just to help me remember the when, why, where I was supposed to do this, that or the other thing?

On my birthday I finally got the nerve up to cut a big skin tag off my ball sack. It was about as big as the end of your pinky finger and was on a nerve and sent a jolt through me anytime it rubbed against my boxers and I had to be real careful getting it out and putting it away when I went to the bathroom. I made sure to rub everything down with alcohol, even the scissors I used. Took a deep breath and told myself I just need 3 seconds of immense courage and snipped it off. I had no idea how much it would bleed. Three hours later I am still bleeding like I have never bled before. She got pissy because we had planned on meeting up with about 8 other family members for dinner. I told her I needed to go to the emergency room and get a couple of stitches. She got mad because I did this when I knew we were supposed to go to dinner with family members. She said once again that she couldn‚Äôt go and had our oldest daughter take me. I ended up with 7 stitches and a special clotting material affixed to it. She said that she would call the other people, two phone calls, and tell them that I was having a lung issue and was going to the ER. She told everybody exactly what happened, even though she knows that I don‚Äôt share personal information like that.

Now here we are 4 days later and her father is in the same hospital because he is having a hard time catching his breath and one of his legs is giving him problems. She is planning on going there early in the morning to see him. Do you see the irony here? Had absolutely no compassion for me, for a situation that I think was a bit more serious and she couldn‚Äôt go to the hospital with me, I thought due to her PTSD, but somebody else and she‚Äôs gotta be there.

Of course there is no closeness between us. I will rub her back and neck, tell her she looks nice, smells good when she wears my favorite perfume, I go to all of her doctor appointments with her, except her therapist, I went once. Yet, I get nothing in return except negative remarks. I get no physical contact from her which I need so badly. Just to have that human touch.

I have no one I can talk to about anything. We have been together for 38 years, married for 36. I have zero friends and always put her before me. The highlight of any day is going to Wal-Mart and getting HER car washed.

I handle all the bills now and if I see something strange in the online ledger I‚Äôve learned that I am not supposed to ask her about it. She would get fixated with these online games and buy upgrade packages or some shit like that. She would spend $400 to as much as $600 a month on this, and that was money we just didn‚Äôt have with her no longer working. But, I can't talk to her about it. It‚Äôs always the same, I am stressing her out.

F[21] and I dated for 2 years. She had addiction issues for quite a while, tried to quit but couldn‚Äôt. Recently a relapse and her BPD flaring up led to our breakup. She was diagnosed as borderline post breakup.
During the relationship, she did briefly suggest past sexual abuse but it seemed as if she had worked it out because she functioned normally. 
Post breakup, there was something that triggered her PTSD and it is hitting her pretty bad along with the breakup.

"Bear attack I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm making this post other than the need to vent. This happened months ago but I can‚Äôt shake the trauma it‚Äôs left me with. I‚Äôve worked in the forest for years and encountered many bears but each time we went our separate ways with no issues. I got too comfortable following the usual advice to stand your ground and scare black bears away, since this always worked I guess I lost my fear. But early July I had a completely different experience that has left me with some obsessive trauma. 

I started work in the woods on a rainy day at 7am. By 8am I was an hours walk into a northern Ontario forest when I saw him. I was completely alone working with trees in vulnerable positions on my knees and such when I turned around and saw a black bear about 30 feet from me staring me directly in the eyes. This initial feeling wasn‚Äôt the scariest part but it‚Äôs the part I can‚Äôt move on from. The feeling of enjoying work to realizing something had been stalking me as prey and I had no idea. My heart dropped and I was in disbelief for a moment because this was already different than my other encounters. I‚Äôve always seen the bear first and felt in control where as this thing already had the upper hand on me and totally snuck up on me. Despite initial shock I tried bluff charging it, yelling and waving my shovel. He slowed his pace but continued to stare me down and close distance.

As he emerged from the bushes now only about 15 feet from me I could tell it was a massive male black bear. The feeling of having complete control to feeling helpless and weaker than I‚Äôve ever felt dawned on me. This is another part that I have trouble getting over, I‚Äôve never felt so powerless in my life. Realizing that this bear saw me as food and clearly was not afraid of me I started backing up and tripping over logs. I slightly turned my back to see where I was going and that‚Äôs when the bear charged me full speed. I started sprinting and screaming for my life. This all happened so fast but basically it closed the gap between us until we were face to face. I turned on my radio and was begging for help from my coworkers and nearby truckers with no answer. I started swinging my shovel at the bear while he stood up and lunged at me with teeth and claws. I swung my shovel so fast just trying to keep space between us. I hit him once in the face with my spade as hard as possible and was shocked when the bear had zero reaction. Although he did slow back down to a walking pace at this point.

The next 60 seconds alternated between me running, the bear catching up and us showing off face to face and repeat. I accepted I was probably done for when eventually I heard a voice of a coworker answer my cry for help. This filled me with life and as soon as we joined together we managed to scare him away until we got back to the vehicles.

The memories are still so fresh and mostly what I can‚Äôt seem to move on from is the silence and cold black stare the bear had. He didn‚Äôt make a sound and was staring into my soul with those black eyes. I immediately knew I was prey and it was the predator with all the power. I think about this every day and don‚Äôt know how to accept this experience and move on.",ptsd
"Heal from Abusive Relationship I‚Äôve never spoken about this openly before, but I can‚Äôt carry this weight in silence any longer. For the past four years, I was trapped in a relationship that broke me in ways I never imagined. I gave everything I had‚Äîmy heart, my soul, my time, my energy. I cared for someone through their worst moments, through their struggles, thinking that this is what love is supposed to be. But in return? I was met with nothing but mental and emotional torture.



Every single day felt like a battle, a battle I never asked for but had to endure. I was manipulated, gaslighted, made to believe I was the problem‚Äîconstantly told I wasn‚Äôt good enough, that I wasn‚Äôt worth anything. I fought to keep that person standing, while they silently tore me apart piece by piece. They drained me of everything I had, until there was nothing left inside of me but emptiness.



And then, when I was at my lowest, when I thought things couldn‚Äôt possibly get worse, they threw me away. Just like that. They cheated, and I was discarded as if I meant nothing‚Äîlike all the sacrifices, all the love, and all the care I gave meant absolutely nothing. It felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest and stomped on. They left me shattered.



Now I live with the aftermath. Every night is a new nightmare. I wake up in cold sweats, reliving every moment of abuse, every word that was used to break me, every look of disdain that told me I wasn‚Äôt worth loving. I can‚Äôt escape it. The memories of the pain haunt me even when I close my eyes. I feel trapped in a never-ending loop of trauma, and I can‚Äôt seem to break free.



People tell you time heals all wounds, but what do you do when the wounds keep getting torn open? When the person who destroyed you walks away without a scratch, while you‚Äôre left bleeding internally? I don‚Äôt know how to heal from this. I don‚Äôt know how to stop the nightmares, how to stop the panic attacks, how to stop the constant ache in my chest. 



I just want to feel normal again, to breathe without this heavy darkness sitting on my shoulders. But right now, it feels impossible. I feel like I‚Äôm drowning, and no one even knows how deep the water goes.



If anyone has been through something like this, please tell me... how do you survive this? How do you rebuild yourself when someone you loved tore you apart?

"""Some things just need to be let go of."" Great advice. But the way she said it was really dismissive, and as if she was giving me in trouble for still being traumatised. This was her response to me (actually in quite a vulnerable state) telling her I can't use use Headspace or Calm apps she likes because the speakers use a tone of voice which triggers physical and emotional flashbacks to the foundational trauma which laid the groundwork and gave me the trauma responses which ultimately led to me seeking out more trauma. She likes the Headspace & Calm apps, and that's great - but my response to the tones of voices used in them is to viscerally want to do the exact opposite of what they're saying, extreme rage, severe emotional upset, fight or flight, usually both. I use the Intellect app, and I like it, but she's quite ""these apps are the ones I trust so they're the only ones I want you using"" about it all. I also use YouTube tutorials and therapy channels, which she disapproves of.


Idk. I just needed to rant about this, a little bit. I've recently managed to forgive my younger self for the behaviour which led to me experiencing trauma in my teens, I've forgiven my family members for their roles in it and their responses. I'm working on forgiving my current self. I've forgiven my childhood bullies. But I haven't forgiven the staff who caused me severe trauma from the ages of 3 to 11. Forgiving people who were also children at the time was something I done without really noticing it, until I realised my mother still hasn't forgiven them. However, forgiving full-grown adults who made the conscious choice to abuse me at that age... that is much, much harder, and I'm working on it, but I'm not there yet. I've partially forgiven the men who took advantage of my trauma in my teens, and its a work in progress, but I'm getting there, along with forgiving that version of myself for having that trauma response. However, my trauma response to the tone of voices used in the Headspace & Calm apps is directly rooted in the abuse I suffered from adults when I was 3 to 11, and my mother is aware of that. However, she doesn't see it as trauma - just something unpleasant i went through. I felt very dismissed and pushed to the side and ignored when she essentially said ""it was years ago, just get over it"" when I know it's my nervous system I need to heal along with my inner child, and that is very difficult to do when I have a level of amnesia surrounding my life prior to being 16. Add in memory loss from malnutrition via anorexia and severely bad mental health throughout my teens, and I have a lot of memory gaps throughout my life. I know my memory was eidetic when I was a child, though, and I have the feeling the severity of my current amnesia is linked to how deeply embedded the memories are / were. I think i would've liked her to acknowledge this, on some level. But she pretty much told me to get over it.",ptsd

During the relationship, she did briefly suggest past sexual abuse but it seemed as if she had worked it out because she functioned normally. 
Post breakup, there was something that triggered her PTSD and it is hitting her pretty bad along with the breakup. It was abuse by close family and that makes it more complicated because she cannot inform any of her family members who seem to be aware of the incident (yeah I know it‚Äôs messed up).

I've been diagnosed fairly recently and I'm still trying to educate myself more on mental health in general since it's not something we've ever talked about in my family or in my line of work.

There has been a lot of violence at home when I was growing up, including physical and emotional abuse. Then I was sexually assaulted when I was 17, then a combat deployment happened.

"Relapse - What now? I was diagnosed with ptsd from a domestic violence situation involving substance abuse & sexual violence.

It's been over five years now and I have done what feels like every therapy under the sun. Dissociation has been the hardest and worst symptom to try and get rid of. The only emotion I felt for years was anger.

In spring, the dissociation broke, and I felt overwhelmed with grief and anxiety. But I cared about the future for the first time in such a long, long time.

I gradually reestablished ties with some family members with the very strict boundary that the person who caused my ptsd is not to be near me.

Two weeks ago, this person just happened to drop by when he knew I was visiting a family member, and he entered the house. The family member who opened the door didn't try and stop him, despite knowing the situation. 

I lost my shit. I was hysterical-- I ran out the front door and had a breakdown. Some family members had no idea of the context-- so I just looked insane as I waited for an uber in my socks.

Everything I thought I had worked through has come rushing back. Dissociation. Nightmares. I've been alternating between crying and rage. And I feel simultaneously that I am a garbage person who deserves to be treated like garbage, and that everyone else in the world is fundimentally bad.

I feel so, so hopeless. I had made so much progress and it's all gone.

"Do you hide/stash away food?  Do you have the tendency to hide food in different places only you know of for, seemingly, no reason? 

I've had this habit for years. Just hiding dry foods and drinks in places only I check, like drawers and dressers. I could freely keep all my food in the kitchen and I don't really have to worry about someone taking the food that I bought but it just doesn't feel *safe*

I stash anything that won't expire or break. Hardtack, trail mix, protein bars, instant soup that I eat dry, prepackaged croissants,loads of flavored water- just anything that will last when left in room temperature and doesn't have a noticeable smell. And if the packaging is too crinkly or over all loud I put everything in plastic containers, like empty containers after butter etc, because even if I know I'm the only person around, too much noise spikes my anxiety or just deters me from reaching for food completely. I even kept military rations packs for a while until I got paranoid that the ""cooking heat packs"" are too noticeable and ridiculous to use when I have a stove just a room away. 

I brushed the hoarding off as me being too lazy to move to get food, but keeping everything close also reminds me that I need to eat since I've got issues with recognizing when it's time to have a meal. 

Do many people hoard the emergency foods for no reason? I feel like I'm insane for doing that so it'd be nice to know if other people do this too. This whole living past trauma is stressful as hell",ptsd

"Abnormal fear responses and my first complex episode I guess I‚Äôll start with the fear response thing?
So, I can become startled, but it‚Äôs just a natural response with little to no emotion behind it. Rarely, I actually feel afraid for a moment, and never longer than a moment.

I wanna go ahead and add this is not a ‚Äúooo look at me, I‚Äôm not scared of shit‚Äù because that‚Äôs not true and that‚Äôs not what this is. The only ways I experience any type of fear is in an existential crisis sort of way, more depression driven than fear; thoughts like, what if I can‚Äôt handle my depression in the future/inevitable events that will cause depression? Deaths, debt, loneliness, failure, regret. It‚Äôs all part of life‚Äôs formula. I started having issues processing fear at some point in my teens, becoming disturbed less and less frequently, and somewhere between then and now it‚Äôs just kind of gone away. Either I live in fear constantly and I can‚Äôt recognize the emotion I‚Äôm most familiar with, or something (else) is not right. 

I don‚Äôt respond to scary movies, I don‚Äôt usually react if someone tries to jump out and scare me. If I do give a fear driven reaction, someone shut a dumpster lid too loud and it sounded like a gunshot, someone slammed a door or one of the neighbors dogs sounded too much like someone screaming, one of the neighbors is emptying clip after clip into their bank, my outside dogs are barking viciously at 1am seemingly out of nowhere, a car on the street revved/sped past and sounded like it was coming up the driveway for a second.

My reactions? I might duck, or put my hands up, I might almost hit someone, maybe I‚Äôll just sit up and listen for a minute. Maybe I‚Äôll keep a weapon nearby, I used to sleep with a hammer between my bed and the wall, but I can‚Äôt do that anymore.

Why?

Some time last year I had my first complex episode where I was not where I really was and I was not seeing what was actually in front of me. I‚Äôve had night terrors forever, they‚Äôve changed and gotten worse as I‚Äôve accumulated more trauma over the years. SA‚Äôs, guns to my head, held at knife point, drive by‚Äôs, getting beaten on several different occasions, wrestling a gun from someone‚Äôs hand so they don‚Äôt end themself before I was even double digits, trap houses, being held hostage, my mom being murdered, my sister being SA‚Äôd. My fucking house burned down in March. The list goes on and on and on.

My night terrors like to do this fun little thing where they put someone I trust in the position of one of my abusers, I wake up paranoid, insomnia for days. Sometimes I have night terrors every night, multiple times a night for as long as 2 months straight. I go out of my mind. I wake up fighting, but I don‚Äôt even scream or cry anymore, I just open my eyes and relax because it‚Äôs like.. oh yeah, that‚Äôs not really happening right now. I haven‚Äôt woken up screaming since my teens. In these dreams no matter who‚Äôs in them or where they‚Äôre taking place, the emotion it always the same. I feel cornered, and I don‚Äôt want to fight, I don‚Äôt want that to be my only option but I‚Äôm compelled to, and I wake up that way. I‚Äôve broken fingers and toes from hitting the bed frame and wall. I‚Äôve thrown partners out of the bed without waking up until they wake me up like ‚Äúwtf did you do that for?‚Äù 

In my day to day, I deal with a lot of dissociative bouts, like the shopping mall closes at random times, I can be doing something important, I could be in the middle of a conversation I ENJOY. Then I‚Äôm locked in the shopping mall and finding out it‚Äôs not really empty. I come out of it and don‚Äôt even know what I was thinking about, I just have the lingering feeling that it wasn‚Äôt good. It‚Äôs inhibited my ability to maintain interpersonal relationships and be consistent at jobs. Up until my complex episode, that was as bad as it got. Now, I don‚Äôt trust myself to have anything easily weaponized within reach if someone else is in my home with me.

When it happened, my ex and I were about to make dinner in the old house (that burned down). I don‚Äôt even remember what we were making, just that we were standing beside each other and we were both dicing something up on the cutting boards. Out of fucking nowhere, with no recognizable trigger, I just saw a hand and a knife, HIS hand, coming towards my face at Mach Jesus. In that half second my brain processed it as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to get stabbed in the throat‚Äù and my entire body tensed up and I went to try to stab him first. Came out of it mid swing, both of us looking at each other, horrified. He had no idea wtf had just happened. I knew it was PTSD and as soon as it was over I knew it hadn‚Äôt been real but in the moment it was and I almost killed someone. I almost killed my boyfriend at the time because I thought he was trying to kill me. 

Nothing had happened leading up to it, it was for no reason. I just put the knife down and went and took a seat at the table and he asked me what had just happened, I told him, and said It would be better if he made dinner by himself because that had never happened before.

I got diagnosed before this episode happened, I was officially diagnosed at 19 (got substance abuse disorder as well) but I had been treated for short term ptsd as a teen because I couldn‚Äôt get anyone to take me seriously. They thought I was just dramatic because at 13 I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and agoraphobia with moderate panic and anxiety attacks. 

I just want my life back.

I want to be able to work and make money, I want to have friends, I want to trust people in my life and hold them close. I can‚Äôt even do these things when the medication I‚Äôm on is working, and it does work. I feel good, I can focus on hobbies, have conversations with people, even strangers, but as soon as it comes to doing anything literally required to survive in the modern world and in society, every symptom comes back. I fight it as long as I can, a couple months I can hide it, maybe, then I‚Äôve reached my limit and I crash and burn.

I‚Äôm in treatment, I‚Äôm fine. It‚Äôs just, like.. damn man. ",ptsd

"I feel something happened with me but I can't remember  Many of you have probably noticed how popular the Menendez brothers case has become lately and it got me hooked too but that's not the point.

"I just feel pathetic and stupid  
So I'm going to be honest about this but this event has been bothering me a lot.

When I was in Ukraine a new guy came and he wasn't a veteran so like all the security and risk mindset stuff you'd think about (not to bore you with acronyms) he just wasn't knowledgeable for.

Towards my time leaving around January 28-29th he wanted to see the zaporizhzhia nuclear damn. 

I'm pretty sure the Russians definitely saw us, we went like dead ass right to the barbed wire and was looking over the line. The new guy wanted to go even further and scope out other parts but I knew that shit was mined. 

Long story short we go to leave and as we're driving man I don't know how to describe but this house next to us just fucking explodes. 

I remember seeing two people outside and when I looked back it's just black smoke and burning embers. These people are fucking done.

I should have died that day. That was most likely meant for us and we were the target.

I should have said at first it was stupid, but I didn't think of it and I should have known better.

Fallowing that after the explosion I should have got out and helped and I didn't. 

I think of that happening everyday. I relived that event so may times. 

I can't even describe the shock of being nearly blown up like that. 

I feel so guilty I didn't stop and help but what the fuck am I gonna do after the fuck they fucking blew up. You're not putting a tourniquet on a fucking dude charcoaled up and moosh.

I wonder why them and not me, what if we didn't go, yeah that village got bombed a lot and they should have left or joined the military but the longer I've been back the more I feel like I'm partly or completely responsible for getting them killed. 

Sometimes I've drinken to forget and sometimes I've drinken to forget have fun but when I've gotten drunk and emotional that's all I can think about and I want to drink more.

Sometimes I'm just having fun and I don't want it to stop so I'm alone with my thoughts again.

I can't answer the thoughts in my head but this is definitely a piece of why I get drunk.

I remember doing work and the artillery would come closer. The explosion sound was never an issue it‚Äôs the shock wave and the feeling of just having no power against it. I can‚Äôt describe. Imagine a guess of wind traveling kilometers after an impact. Artillery and gun shots don‚Äôt bother me from the sound but the feeling of the ground and wind if just ungodly and nerving. 

I used to do a deliver to one village and it was a small village right before the front. I remember seeing this most beautiful girl with her child. Her husband apparently died in the war so she took care of her kid alone. A week after I left that village was bombed and her house is gone and she and her kid is probably dead. 
 
I went to zaporizhzhia some days and drove to the work area from there a bit. I remember seeing a child in crutches because he had been injured. 

Theirs not a day that‚Äôs goes by I don‚Äôt see something that remind me. Every Ukraine flag I see on a car brings me back and sometimes it‚Äôs good memories but sometimes it‚Äôs this stuff I think about.

Does anyone else here stream music all day? I am also just curious if this something to do with mental illness or how my brain is wired. Just venting and curious if most people have music to soothe them.,ptsd
"Sick all the time I‚Äôve been dealing with PTSD for two years after getting out of an abusive relationship where I experienced SA.
I‚Äôve been having so many health issues since then and am trying to figure out the cause and maybe how to help myself as doctors and medicine hasn‚Äôt been helpful and I‚Äôm in limbo as to what to do at this point.

A few months after I left this relationship and around the time I first reported this person to the police, I started getting physically ill.

I started feeling incredibly tired and achy as well as having lots of brain fog and occasional heart palpitations.
A lot of my symptoms have improved since then but I‚Äôm still also at least a little bit tired if not exhausted and more recently have been having brains fog, especially at work.
I get sick with flu like symptoms/infections every two to three weeks.
I also have developed chronic sinusitis and visual snow syndrome randomly (I never had any health issues before)

Especially lately I‚Äôm finding it harder and harder mentally to cope, it feels like my life has been taken away from me and I‚Äôm struggling to survive.

I just want to know if anyone else who had been diagnosed with PTSD had experienced similar issues after?

"Trigger SA rude comment from internet guy I was talking to an internet guy about how I was raped and how it destroyed my mental health. He then responded, ""did you try to enjoy it though?"" when I expressed how hurtful that comment was he doubled down on the idea that since I was trapped I should have tried to enjoy it, so I said something I can't even repeat. Called him a worthless piece of shit and then blocked him...  
I feel so bad about the things I said to him but I can't understand the level of ignorance or cruelty that it would take to say what he said to me.

"Newborn and Losing it (Veteran) Throwaway sorry for the wall of text

What are some non VA alternatives for therapy? Anyone else with Ptsd and a newborn?

I've struggled with ptsd for years, but this year was particularly bad and I just started trying to go to the VA for it which has been a fucking nightmare. I wanted to try and get better before the kid came but my community care therapist (who i had to drive 1.5 hours to see because no one near me was taking new patients) literally made me feel more suicidal so I stopped seeing her. With the nightmare that is trying to find a new therapist in the first place, I called the VA who told me there's a 9 month waiting list with the hospital to get someone. Only on an antianxiety medication mainly cause of fear during the med rebalancing phase with antidepressants when another vet friend who almost committed suicide during it but I but the bullet and contacted my VA psychiatrist to start that process (funny how getting meds is way fucking easier than getting therapy).

I'm absolutely losing it with having a new kid. 6 week old and these feelings have been escalating. Objectively, I know my kid is absolutely normal and there is nothing wrong. But her crying triggers the fuck out of me. Tonight I snapped and lost it. I was wearing her in a harness as me and my wife take shifts at night, bottle was heating up, and she just kept crying. I had to just calmly somewhat lightly hit my fist against the wall to concentrate on something besides the crying while the bottle heated up. Wife came out rightfully worried and concerned and asked me to stop and I just lost it. I just hit the wall harder while still wearing my kid, I just snapped. I took the kid out of the harness, gave her to the wife and just had to bash my head against the wall to get back to a more stable place. I know it's not normal and not ok, but it's what I needed to do in the moment to snap out of it (just concentrating on one intense stimulus which I have decent control over). I screamed at my wife all the suicidal shit I've been holding in my head. I still do think my wife and kid would be better without me.

I immediately called the suicide hotline. I'm sorry to say it did not help and they just sent another referral in to the VA for Monday. I was able to get a hold of another vet friend to talk to. I use to work in hospitals, and I am absolutely adverse going to the Emergency Department for help (same with inpatient).

Parental leave is coming to an end as well but imagining going back to work with this seems like a nightmare (new job as well so I don't have FMLA protecting it).

"I feel alienated and alone. So I was just having discussions with my university friends. There was a point he made that it would have been better if I had studied something during the 3-month vacation instead of just ""enjoying,"" which hurt me a lot because I was working on my trauma during those 3 months. It was the hardest thing for me to take a break from the constant cycle of study and feeling overwhelmed. This fear productivity allowed me to get into top 10 and I felt afraid that if I fix my trauma I will lose it. But I finally decided that this suffering was too much for me and that I didn't want to live like that, I worked on my trauma, almost finished The Body Keeps the Score, gained a lot of internal understanding, did lots of journaling, yoga, and other things. Trauma was coming out with full intensity; I couldn't sleep at night, my hands kept shaking, and every day I woke up with a sense of depression, feeling like I can't do the things I love, and that I couldn't move forward toward my dream. I felt jealous of people who worked for it. I was walking on a dark road not even sure if I would even heal or not. As my circumstances were I couldn't afford therapist. I knew this study gap will fk me up a little, but I also knew that it was important, even if no one understood me and thought it was me being lazy. A critical part of me also thought I was just doing this to avoid the hardships of life. I felt afraid of what I would do when I went back to university after this much time gap. But I had no other options. After many days, I started to see results, and now I am very healed‚Äînot fully, but very. In recent exams I performed very well without sacrificing my mental health. And now when someone summarizes something like this, that a part of me still is conflicted and afraid of, as ""enjoyment,"" it breaks me.",ptsd
"Was this considered standing up for myself and what more should I do?¬†¬†Dealing with my PTSD

# 

Long story short, I fell victim to bullying in high school (I was getting beaten up pretty badly, insulted regularly, called the n word, harassed on social media) all by this one bully in particular. He'd say sorry always then just repeat the behaviour. It came to a point where he stopped because we graduated and didn't see each other anymore.

He sent me an apology on Facebook a few years after high school though. Fast forward to today, I decide to message him and tell him Ive been praying for him and wishing him good things as he's a lovely person. and mentioned how he probably feels back for how he treated me back then and I acknowledged that the message might go unseen but just wanted to let him know.

He responds and says it looks like im doing well in life and said he felt bad about how he treated me and said he wishes me nothing but the best. I then start to dig a little deeper asking why he'd beat me up and call me the n word etc. He straight out denied those claims and says we both know that never happened. I sent him a screenshot of him calling me the n word and he said he doesn't remember saying that and apologizes.

We end up going back and forth until he randomly throws an accusation that Ive been spreading rumours about him over the last two years about him raping his ex girlfriend and how I can't deny it since he has my IP address pinned. I told him what he plans on doing with that info because intimidation and what he's claiming would be grounds to take legal action and said we can take this to court.

He responds and says ""for the hundredth time, im done with these conversations, bye for now"".

"Healing Begins with Love Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a song that‚Äôs really close to my heart,¬†**""Healing Begins with Love""**. As a veteran advocate and someone who's been through some difficult transitions, this song speaks deeply to the power of love in the healing process. Whether it's healing from trauma, emotional wounds, or the challenges of life, love is often the bridge that gets us to the other side.

This song came out of a documentary project I'm working on about veteran suicide prevention, and it holds so much meaning for me personally. It's not just about healing for veterans but for anyone going through tough times.

Give it a listen, and I hope it resonates with you as much as it has for me.

"i need some help knowing how to feel about my trauma while I was enlisted :( OKAY SO.... 
throw away for obvious reasons.... 
but this is going to go over... SA :( and stuff, so heads up ig?

here we go anyways.

this is going to be a long one so I do apologize.
I 21(f) need some help understanding how I should feel about this-
to start, 
I should explain my confusion.

I am severely autistic

(while undiagnosed because i like haveing rights as an independent adult human being) 
- ""high functioning"" and its not even funny. 
but nothing on paper.
no less the tism runs through my veins 
and I mention it because-

I have trouble with... 
understanding how I should feel about things-  
especially emotionally charged things like events or trauma.
even more especially given I was raised to be forgiving and to always turn my cheek the other way, and have lived that way since I moved out at 17

which is the problem.
because I am also a veteran, (remember undiagnosed)
nothing hard-core, mostly signal stuff and low physical work force. 
I mention this because this whole thing was while I was enlisted. 

I have only been out for about 9 to 10 ish months due to being medboarded for injuries.
but what happened has been...
bothering me to say the least but I can't make heads or tails why or if it should be. and I'm worried that I am simply dwelling and overreacting?

enough padding I'll just get into the story-

about last year (2023) I was stationed in state, I had recently left Korea and had been riding the coattails of my 21st birthday near the beginning of that previous December.

which if you know what a combination of those 2 things means. 
I was very new to alcohol.

when I got to my new station there were a few bumps that let to my units shaping a few people around, like raid parties threatening to have a gate named after you.

so after that and about a half of the year, 
i was getting to my new unit which is where I met the person in this story.

lets call him ""guy"" M(22)
me and guy‚Ñ¢Ô∏è got along pretty well, especially given the fact he was more simular to me then most anyone else there.
me and guy were both on profiles, me for lower bilateral leg injuries and him for I belive back issues,
so even though our mos(jobs) were pretty different, neither of us could move our heavy equipment-
meaning we both often ended up doing the jobs that thay gave to us and the other profiles.

basically, we hung out alot during work, and then after we would hang out with others guys who were also on profiles because there was that shared kinship with us at his place,
 
I fit in because I grew up with a bunch of guys and pretty much grew up as one myself- so I liked all the games they played and was more then competitive enough to keep up with them.

so this pretty much becomes our schedule for the next few months.
me and Guy hanging out, ""shooting the shit"" as they say, going over to his or the other guy's place for games n what not-
but over all I didn't drink alot during those times.

eventually we agreed that everyone just going to Guy's place would work best because it was closer to our company, and then the hangouts stayed there.

then the issues happened.

during that time I started drinking more to help me fit in with the group- even when they started to leave, I kept it up because social interaction feels alot less terrible if I play along.

nothing too crazy but with a bunch of rowdy drunk guys playing video games over the weekend, you tend to over look a few things, 
which that being even while still buzzed, I did catch that any physical contact that would normally happen, you know like pile ups, bumping your shoulder into the other guy, joking hugging as a bit or to weird the other guy out, etc, 
and a bunch of men chanting ""Go white girl, go"" ""Go white girl, go"" as I shot gun 3 beers 
and what not 

but guy‚Ñ¢Ô∏è's hands kinda reached a lil lower then the others, which... in hindsight is a big red flag, but I pretty take the blame there because even though we were gaming and drinking, unlike the others who were basically in shorts and t-shirts, I still wore stuff that made me feel decent and pretty- you know like how girls are supposed to (?) (again- still painfully tistic)

so, I pretty much called it up to either mistakes, missing some social que or just my fault because what should I expect ig.

but it kept going, and as the other guys started to dwindle, mostly due to their own medboards getting them out Scott free. 
Guy would encourage me to drink more- ""to keep up the energy n what not.""
which again, a big red flag in hindsight, but I am pretty much blind when it comes to foresight.
around that time my doc even suggested I also medboard given my condition was not getting better.

and eventually it was just me and guy‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, getting drunk and playing video games, which with him pretty much being my only friend left, I didn't have much else to do on the weekends anyways.

but he started encouraging me to drink more and more, meaning I got alot more wasted. and he while drinking with me would drink alot less (ANOTHER RED FLAG but one I think I may have intentionally overlooked because I thought it was normal)

and then it started.
I woke up back at my own place, after being black out drunk, with a terrible migrane, and a really sore mouth..... 
apparently while I was drunk... yeah.
which, I pretty much thought in the back of my head for a while but like all my other fears or confusions I have with people, things that happened, and over all unpleasantness.
I pushed it to the back of my mind, especially because it was Monday and I didn't have time to think about anything like that.

I should mention here now if not had earlier, but dispite the red flags, Guy was still pretty much my only friend left, and had been nothing but kind and supportive- often helping me with things I didn't quite get- helping me with certain social cues, and over all nothing questionable or overtly uncomfortable during the work week or anything like that.
we even were rather personally close because we had talked about our previous traumas- like his families issues and my previous trauma of getting groomed.

but then the next weekend the worst happened and the thing that is pretty much why this whole wall of text is here in the first place.
and again 

///this is not fun stuff so like, turn back now or somthin if you don't wanna read this stuff\\\\

but yeah.
with the previous weekend a blure and way too busy and stressful given we had to do alot of practicing for an upcoming mission.
so with the implied questionable blackout far beck in my head repressed and forgotten, I missed another red flag.

this hangout felt off, even in comparison from the previous ones, but I am used to pushing off that anxiety because I have always felt anxious when it comes to socializing.
and things went as normally as the hang outs go, except we had alot more liquor then usual,
Guy even chanting the nostalgic ""go white girl go"" (hah....) encouraging me to chug stuff.

even as alarm bells started ringing in my head, I was way too inebriated to do anything...
and next thing I new I was pushed onto his bed.
and he had pulled out a rubber.
I'm sure we can all figure out what happened next.

I remember every. bit of it. my mind almost imidiatly sobered up but I couldn't do anything to move my body. I felt weak, my limbs were impossibly heavy, I was face down onto a mattress, crying but it was muffled and I pretty much had to be stuck there, unable to do anything.
it went on untill he was done and had left the room to go wash up.
and I pretty much went fetal.

when ever he came back, he saw the state I was in and then probably realized how bad this looked.
so he pretty much sat me up, got me repressed and started apologizing, begging and saying that was an accident and he didn't realize  what he had done and that we are both clearly drunk.

it was terrifyingly genuine.
and heres my problem....
i can't tell.
this event (and the next one.) (yeah there's more because im an idiot) 
has basically been in my head ever since.
I think even I could tell it has traumatized me- to the point where any time I even think of remembering him or things we used to do I feel ill and my stomach feels like it's tied in knots...
but I can't help but think it's my fault too... 
there were so many red flags, so many things that any normal person should have seen and whiped out the whistle and ran the other way, but I just didn't notice I felt like it was just normal guy things and then boom.

anyways

he ""helped"" me get dressed-
from there everything was a blur.
the next day my primary health provider told me I would be getting medically discharged bythe middle of the folowing month, and I was told to start the medboard discharge prossess.

I was essentially a walking zombie, going from point a to b.
I started drinking more on my own just to get through the night and not be alone with my thoughts 
(I know, the last thing you should do)

my brain tried to blur out what happened, and even when I though about going to my chain of command I remembered just how painful the discharge prossess can get with any delay.
I just wanted to leave.

and with everyone else ready for a mission, it was me going to do the stuff with who ever they had available to help.
that being those on profile.
meaning I was stuck with guy following me everywhere for the next month.

I was blank, I was so focused on just leaving that I didn't even had time to think about what happened, I try to push it to the back of my mind, but it was always there, and guy pretty much either trying to save face or out of genuine compassion had been acting like his typical self, being as helpful as he used to be, making jokes like how we used to and helping me find my way around base when I got lost trying to find where to go next.

and as everything came and went, it was the next month.
I guess I fully repressed it because things felt normal again, even made friends with the new guys who joined the profile group, and as we got closer to my deadline I felt comfortable hanging out either people.

guy being there was inevitable because i hadent told a soul and was way too stressed and busy to confront what happened, 
so ofcourse all of the fellow ""cripple crew"" as one of our new guys dubbed us, drinking was unavoidable cus army plus my drinking becoming a problem, but I made sure that I wouldn't be alone with guy, (who had now become a borderline alcoholic too ig)

well. that didn't work too well because only a week away 
we had a fairwell party for me, 
and ofcourse, it was at guys place because it was close to our company.
-
I let my drinking catch up with me, I wasn't black out, but, I didn't notice that everyone else had left.
and as I was getting my stuff from the bathroom to leave I was pretty much stopped on my way out by guy.

and I pretty much froze.
and everything floded back.
I wasn't ready for this, I knew I had to be careful but I slipped up and now I was pretty much in danger.

pretty much the next thing I know I was hand tied to a bed with a ethernet cable as he pretty much started... groping-
now. 
am I an idiot- very much so, 
but i wasnt mentally ready to avoid him everywhere like i should have...
I was so used to seeing him everywhere every day that untill I was in danger I didn't even mentally register that these were the same man...

so another thing thats my fault ig..., but I did do somthing this time- before anything could else happen i pretty much kept kicking him off of me and even tho my throat froze up and I couldn't speak (because panic attacks suck) I kept pushing him off and was crying, but It didn't fully stop him cus he got the upper hand on me and started... removing clothing.

after... alot of indignity but no penetraition, it's almost like he came to what was happening.
he muttered somthing and drunkenly put what he taken off of me back om.
as soon as he untied me, I made a straight run for the bathroom.


I locked the door behind me and pretty much broke down...
after throwing up in the toilet twice I sat down, back against the door for what felt like forever...
I was just one week away from here, to freedom.
so I just, sat there... and waited and waited.

after a while I grabbed my things i had dropped, and left the bathroom, he was just, sitting on his bed, staring at the wall.

so I pretty much as quietly as I could made a break for the door, he didn't follow or even look at me.

for the next week i was a shell.
my brain has been a wreck since, but that week was hell.
my mind just played everything on repeat, I blamed myself for kitting it happen again, and I noticed all the red flags from before, I wanted to leave the army and never look back, all my paper work was done, but the stress was even more pressing because I had to move all my stuff in the next 4 days, hell on the next day they already had another guy being moved into my place, so I had to move all my stuff out, either a random e4 living there with me for 3 of those days as I tried to find a place to leave my stuff.

and what would you know, my chain of comman had the brilliant idea of having Guy temporarily hold my stuff till I was finalized ""because you guys are best friends and what not, dw your battle buddy has enough room"".....

so yeah.

we pretty much loaded my stuff into my car but I made sure I had another person with me, under the premise of my injuries and my stuff being far too heavy and I got the hell out of there.




so.

10ish months later and this is pretty much where we are today.
I know I should have informed my chain of command, and  it's likely going to haunt me for the rest of my life that I didn't do somthing, especially because he's already gotten out due to medboard aswell so I can't do anything about it now.

but there lies my problem.
I am haunted by these events in episodes, I can go at most a few days with it pushed out of my mind- especially with how busy I am in civilian life, but then I remember and feel all of this stuff again.

I. don't know how to feel.
what happened has left me scared but there were so many things I could have done to avoid it, I could have gotten retribution, I could have done this or that, a million things.

but I didn't. and somehow I can sometimes go a day or two or three and be normal- not moody or have panic attacks, even my drinking has become far more normalized and I bearly do it, maybe a drink or two monthly.
I feel I deserve this pain, or that because it was so avoidable that maybe subconsciously I wanted this?
or the fact I can go days normally that maybe in just over reacting...??
do I forgive him for all the kindness he's done for me and just hate what he did???

I don't know how I should feel.
that's always been my problem, growing up I had to be told how things make people feel, and that's what I've based my understanding on.
but i don't know what to do here....

please. any help or advice. anything.
thankyou for putting up with this massive wall of text and I sincerely apologize for any discomfort I've brought.

so.

"Can you develop PTSD months after an event? So essentially the situation is the following.
A few months ago I was visiting two of my partners at the time and long story short is that I got really really high to the point of not being able to stand properly, much less walk, and wasn't able to really consent properly.
I stayed high the entire trip, and the only times they stopped me from getting more high was when I'd have reached a point where I'd be unable to speak or understand a word they were saying.
After the trip I didn't put much thought into any of it, and about 2 weeks afterwards they broke up with me.

About a week ago I started thinking about the trip again, and I felt awful about it.
I tried to tell one of my closest friends about it but that's when I realized that I was too high to actually remember the details of what happened.
I couldn't even remember which one of them took my first kiss or my first time.
Ever since I realized these things it made me think about the trip in a whole different light, and I've been having trouble sleeping, waking up multiple times every night, and having periodic anxiety attacks throughout the day.

Up until I really put thought into it, I didn't really think about the trip in any negative way.
I only started feeling awful about it and experiencing the anxiety attacks and trouble sleeping after I realized how impaired I was at the time and how much information was just completely missing from my memories.

So my question is, is it normal or common for people who experience trauma of any kind, to only start exhibiting symptoms of PTSD after they realize that what they went through was a traumatic experience?

"I need help I have severe PTSD from childhood, and 14 years later, I haven't made much progress, and anytime I do, I eventually fall further than before... I hate myself for being this way... why won't I just heal? I want to be able to be a normal person. Join society, and function... but I haven't left the house in YEARS... My home town is where my trauma happened... any time I leave I have flashbacks... I can barely take care of myself, let alone my emotional support animal... I never walk her, and sometimes it's hard to even feed her... my trauma involves having been brainwashed into loathing myself completely, which is hard to break when you do nothing, because it must be true. Everyone looks at me, expecting me to spring back. They look at me like I'm wasting my potential, and it's true. I just feel frozen in time, like I'm still that little kid, being touched when I didn't want to be, being beaten up daily, being whipped, and cut, and I just can't handle it anymore. I'm so overwhelmed by the amount of pain I feel, by the voices screaming in pain in my head, and by the distance between where I am, and where I want to be... not to mention my LGBT+ identity and the strain that has put on my relationships over the past years, especially as a Christian...

I'm currently unemployed and staying at home but I think my father has been masturbating watching me asleep from few months or years.
I noticed it few months back

I told my mom, we are not rich and my father has good reputation in public.
My mom advised me to study well and get a job and move out of the house.
That's the only way you can protect yourself....like we can't break the family right now as my brother's mental condition is not good and all kinds of situations are there!!

My mom's trying her best to stay awake when I sleep 
but these days I can't even sleep properly in the night, when it's 6pm when it gets dark I start to fear....oh how do I sleep this night...!

I don't actually wanna do any ruckus and create problems for my family in the society.
 So studying and getting out of house with a job seems to be right option for me if I'm speaking practically!

These days I'm so scared... I'm having PTSD symptoms so strong... I jump scare even if I hear the breath of my father in the same room! I shiver, I can't breathe properly and all the things!!

"My first post/Spouse has PTSD/Very long post/Vent  My spouse M73 has PTSD from childhood trauma. He is also recovering alcoholic, 10 yrs sober. I  have so many questions and suspicions about his diagnosis. It was suggested to me by a career therapy patient friend that perhaps he had PTSD, maybe 15 yrs ago. That resonated with him but he did nothing  about it, he was drinking still at that time. 

Then he got sober and wore a PTSD bracelet for a while. Then decided he didn't want to be defined that way any longer, took off bracelet after wearing for several years, never to wear it again. He seemed more accepting of his situation (mental problems) while he wore it.  I need to add, I have noticed that he gets caught up in the newest ideas or something that sounds 'cool' to him. Even if someone uses an interesting word, he'll find a way to insert that word into his vocabulary the next 2 weeks.  It's like he was really impressed by it and wants it for himself. Someone at his meetings did  namaste  (prayerful pose, bowing) and he did that for a couple  of weeks. Someone talked to him about Zen Buddhism, bam, he is suddenly intrested...for 2 weeks. Makes him look thoughtful and intelligent, he thinks, because he was raised by a mother and system where, by God, you had better be the perfect children and not fuck up, be the smartest, have the best posture, get all the awards, be class president, be altar boy, make no fusses ever, make your mother proud!  Meanwhile he was abused at home and Dear Saint Mother did nothing and she knew of it, because he confronted her. She just made herself to be the victim and said she thought his siblings would kill him if she tried to stop them. So she got a pass. I told the therapist about it and it wasn't until then that he started to face what his mother did. 

He did a heavy duty legit personality test where the therapist said she was surprised he was not a criminal or in prison. I took this to mean he may be psychotic. I have suspected that about him, but just not criminal intentions. Highly manipulative. I have long (for decades) thought he narcissistic. Fits the mold to a ""T"". 

He's been thru many therapists. I don't know how far he gets with them before he quits them. He gets defensive when I ask any question. I suspect he has either fooled them long enough, or therapist gets too close.  Every therapist has been 'the one' and then somehow, spouse drifts off, declaring he doesn't need therapy anymore. I will add that during our 40 plus year marriage, he insisted we were having 'marriage problems' and did blame me for so many things.  Every therapist we went to lasted for a little while, and truth be told, I just gave up because even the therapist believed when I said something about his drinking. He was called out on a few things, he admitted to these things, but never, until he did his 12 steps did he ever make amends to me. Our marriage is only on paper now. I have been wanting to leave for years but I have it made where we live, i.e. I get to do what I want, except have a boyfriend. I miss the sex. I'm 9 years younger. 

He is sour, critical, sarcastic, moody most of the time. When he visited our daughter in June, he came back a different person. He was happy and was actually enjoyable to be around. I started to think that maybe we could make this work. 

Then I took a trip early October for a week and when I came home, I was sick with Covid. And then last night I had to go to  emergency clinic for something else, not life threatening and not covid related. He was sighing deeply and miserable the whole time in the clinic, saying things like he made a big mistake coming early to appointment (I thought I could get in if I clocked in early, clinic was too busy for that on this day).   Now he has gone back to being sour and critical, non communicative, etc.   He doesnt' like taking  care of me when I'm sick. As long as he is in the house, that's as good as it gets. He does ask how I am feeling.  He will shop for me and get soup. He's great about shopping for me, always. He will do just about anything I ask of him, but I don't ask much of him.  I still cook meals, prepare snacks, grocery shop a little but I volunteer and have an active social life, so he does most grocery shopping. 

Just now he got up from a nap and seemed ok. He is going for a walk. If he hurts his back, he is in an even worse funk  and is grumpier and comes at me more  than usual to me.  I'm not grumpy when I get sick. I just am not having fun but still have my sense of humor. I'm extrovert, he is the exact opposite. No friends. None. Zero.   Does not like most people and criticizes the smallest thing, even people on TV aren't safe from his criticism Hair, voice, clothes. you name it. I'm low brow because I like The 3 Stooges and funny cat videos.  He spends his days playing on line card or chess, reading politics, watching political things, or seeing how our money is spent.  We're pretty low maintenance. I cut my own hair, do not do salons, more of a boho casual dresser. He kinda looks for cans of worms to open too.  

Today I am feeling so much better. I usually go out one night  on the weekends.  He asked me about my plans for the day and I said I haven't been asked out yet for tonight by my friends, but it would depend on what it is. He said, let's say you were asked to go to your usual place, would you go? I want to see how responsible you are. I must say, he has been showing signs the past month or so of being controlling again. Do this, do that. Or he'll start to tell me what to do, stop and say never mind, don't want to tell you what to do. When he already did just that. He has a strong history of manipulation, not just with me but his children as well. One daughter barely speaks to him, gray rocks him, and the other he successfully brainwashed her to think he's Mr. Wonderful, but in reality he is spiritually abusive and manipulative. Quoting the bible to her and shit like that, when he knows that is her soft spot.  I mean if he is so spiritual, why doesn't he behave that way all the time, not just with her or people he is trying to impress with his headiness? 

I see him for the basic good man he is, yet he is  phony, I see that too. I feel sorry for him that he has really never been happy, he had a wife (me) who loved him madly and he drove me away by trying to break me and he was almost successful but I got into AlAnon and learned the problem was not just him. I was part of the problem too. I allowed his behavior, fought back, said mean things. So I learned to live my own life and here we are. We get along for the most part.

I do miss male companionship, desperately. I do not want to have sex wtih him, the thought of him doing things to me turns my stomach. I'm still young, attractive, fun. I've been flirted with and just recently a man asked me if I'm married. I said yes but if my sister was not there, I think I would have committed adultery that night. 

I still feel bad for him because he seems constitutionally unable to kick and work thru his issues. He has the head knowledge...he can remember and repeat anything he reads or sees on TV, or hears from people. He just can't seem to make anything stick and put these things he sees/hears to action, or for very long. The only thing he's been truly able to do, is quit drinking. 

t's very frustrating for me, but I do feel sorry for him that he just can't seem to move off square 1. 

He does take welbutrin for depression but since this latest therapist told him he has PTSD, I have researched what meds for him  to take and welbutrin is not one that treats PTSD.  That's not to say he might still need it for depression but I've asked spouse if he needs meds tweaked. I've been told to mind my own business.  He takes a shitton of supplements. Eyes, blood, prostate health, high blood pressure, also several prescriptions but sooo many supplements. I have not said anything to him about the amount of supplements but I remember when I took a lot during the new supplements phase, 30 yrs ago or so, I felt like shit. 

I brought up divorce and he told me we would pay 40% to the tax man if that happened. I told him I looked into it, and he isn't correct. We wouldn't lose a penny to Uncle Sam. Divorce is not a taxable event.  I think he fact checked me, because that's about the time he started being decent to live with. That and the trip to our daughter, they came about the same time. 

Will this PTSD ever be resolved? I think he enjoys being miserable, a victim. And he wants me to walk down that road with him, and I just won't.

"Volunteering with Crisis Services as a Survivor, good or bad idea?  (edit: I hope I used the right flair, I'm not super familiar with Reddit haha)

After many many years of therapy and treatment, I feel arguably even more resilient than before ""what happened."" A while back, my therapist and I were talking about ""giving back"" so to speak. I've come a long way in my healing, and I like to help others. Plus, I'm trying to get out of my current field and I think it would help my resume. So, in that sense it almost feels like a win-win, at least on paper.

Despite all my growth though, I cry pretty easily when hearing others stories. I'm not sure I'd be a great fit if I get upset while someone else is in a crucial moment and needs stability. At the same, it would be one way to strengthen my resilience, but the consequences seem pretty daunting if I mess up. I don't want anyone to get hurt or feel more isolated because I couldn't be strong enough to carry them through a moment of crisis.

Does anyone here have experience volunteering with crisis agencies or similar places? Do you have advice for doing that kind of work with and/or recovered from PTSD?",ptsd
"Progress is Terrifying TW: Mentions abuse and sex

Hey, all. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has felt this way. I (27f) have ptsd from an abusive relationship I was in seven years ago. It was my first and only relationship and it lasted three years.  He was very controlling, emotionally and psychologically abusive, and coerced me to have sex with him almost daily. I‚Äôve been in therapy for four years to try and work through this.  I have only been on a handful of dates and have difficulty with intimacy of any kind and on any level with men. 

Suddenly, I meet a new guy at work. I think he is so cute. ‚ÄúWhoa‚Ä¶I think he‚Äôs cute‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt felt attraction towards someone since leaving my ex. For a second, I was kinda impressed that I felt that way, and had this moment of being pleased and proud of how far I‚Äôve come. When I started ptsd treatment, I couldn‚Äôt even look at my male therapist. It took me months. Now, four years into treatment, I find someone attractive. This is a good thing, right? 

Wrong. I am terrified. I know that on paper, this is progress and I should be feeling nothing but happiness!  Instead, I feel like I‚Äôm walking closer and closer to something dreadful.  Has anyone else felt like this before???

"What exactly is a flashback/trigger? Do these experiences of mine correspond with the definition? TW: references to physical/emotional abuse and neglect

I have a very odd relationship with the PTSD/CPTSD label. I‚Äôve been in therapy for years (love it) but when I was about 12 or 13, my therapist assessed me for PTSD pertaining to a specific event that had happened recently. I remember her saying something about how I met the criteria, except I hadn‚Äôt presented symptoms long enough. On top of that, I didn‚Äôt even feel the symptoms in relation to that event - I felt it in relation to my parents. So I did not walk away with a diagnosis.

My second therapist immediately caught onto my family life, and when I brought up how my previous therapist very briefly looked into PTSD, she empathetically told me that if she were to do the same, I would probably meet the criteria for a diagnosis. Still didn‚Äôt get diagnosed, but we focused heavily on my relationship with my parents.

I have memories of trying to describe arguments to her, and feeling very strange. I‚Äôve had panic attacks, but it was as if all of my symptoms were invisible or internal. She would ask me to describe what I was feeling and I couldn‚Äôt give an answer. The words wouldn‚Äôt come out. I thought I would burst out sobbing, but at most, only a few tears would slip out. I could only stare somewhere in the room and feel overly conscious of how shaky I felt, how my head felt like it was swimming, how my heart was pounding, how heavy my chest was. I was practically unresponsive.

My current therapist explained to me that diagnoses are really only shorthand for professionals, really only necessary like if she needed to transfer me to another therapist. She doesn‚Äôt refute my concerns about PTSD, but she‚Äôs never directly confirmed them. I think this makes me feel uneasy because my first therapist initially refused to diagnose me with ANYTHING saying it‚Äôd look bad on my resume (terrible). But my current one has also focused heavily on my childhood trauma, recognizing how it influences my thinking today, acknowledging the inner child in me that was never given proper attention, who was hurt. We will be doing an ART session soon. I very much trust her, but feel somewhat mixed feelings. But I believe that may be due to my own hypervigilance, if I had to put a word to it. And it seems like she‚Äôs actually been treating my PTSD(?) the entire time I‚Äôve been with her.

My parents had an argument some time ago. My mom remarried my stepdad who I love to BITS over a decade ago. They are happily married. He‚Äôs safe and he loves me very very much. But that day when I heard them arguing, it felt like I was on fire. I was shaking, felt like I had a hot flash, my stomach churned, and I did the most impulsive thing I‚Äôve ever done in my life. While they wouldn‚Äôt notice, I took my car and drove to a nearby park, stopped in a quiet street and sobbed in my car for 15 minutes straight. I turned off my location and was afraid to reach out to anyone, and the only thought on my mind was that I was alone and that I had to run away. Things weren‚Äôt safe anymore, and my family was going to split apart again. The danger of being on my own couldn‚Äôt compare to the danger of my house. I made myself sit down for a meal somewhere before returning home with a birthday gift for my brother, where things were fine and healthy.

When I tried to recount this day to my therapist, I was the most distraught I‚Äôd ever been in a session for a very long time. I felt the same things as I mentioned earlier, and what always stands out to me with these kinds of things is how I just can‚Äôt seem to talk. I could feel the words on my tongue but I couldn‚Äôt say them. And when I finally did, it was through uncontrollable crying. I barely felt like I was sitting on her couch there. All I could say was that I felt like I needed to run away.

I asked her how she would describe what happened to me in that session from her perspective. In my head I was wondering if this is what a flashback or a triggered state would look like, but she used some different terminology. She said that my hysteria (she reassured me it only meant that my response was out of proportion for the situation, which is true. lol) was probably because my body recognized the stimuli from my traumatic memories (yelling, anger, smells, sounds, etc) and acted as if it was happening now - because these memories become storied in the body (she said somatic memory) and get recalled under similar circumstances.

I know this is an absolute wall of text, so thank you to anyone who reads this far. Does anyone have similar experiences? I would love to hear peoples‚Äô insight. I‚Äôm very proud of how much growing I‚Äôve done, but having specific words to understand my experiences and responses would bring a great deal of comfort to me.",ptsd

I haven't really told him how deep my disgust runs, I don't want him to feel rejected or feel bad. I am afraid I'll panic or show a very obvious sign of disgust when er eventually do it or when we talk about it.

"I think my ex boyfriend is stalking me      So me (19F at the time) and my ex boyfriend (20M t the time) dated for about 4 months. We were friends at first but slowly feelings started to develop and we decided to try dating. At first everything was going fine, but I started to notice his strange behavior over time.
    
    For example, once when I was at his place, we were drinking coffee with his parents (yes he STILL lives with his parents) and I noticed that he was sitting at the table with his knees against his chest and holding them in his arms kinda like sitting in the fetal position. I get it that it's his house but personally I see that as being disrespectful. Like I would try to behave somewhat normally if I had guests over. Also he would just stare at me for no reason for a really long time. Secondly I noticed that he treated me like I was his mother. Wanted me to take care of him and console him and hug him and kiss him every single second when we were together. I had asked him that does he have a mommy kink but he denied it everytime I asked him about it. He also wanted me to dominate him in pretty much every situation which I didn't like at all. (There was alot more weird things that happend in the relationship).
    
    Slowly I started to think that maybe we should break up because our relationship wasn't really working anymore. I asked if we could meet up and talk. I told him that maybe it would be best for both of us if we broke up. He clearly has his own problems that he should discuss with a professional and I said that I myself have my own problems that I needed help with. He seemed to understand but asked if we could still keep in touch. I said maybe and then he asked for a last hug. When he was hugging me he said ""maybe in the future we can try again"". In my head I just went ""nope"" and left to go home. 
    
    Afetr the breakup he continued to send me messages every single day for 2 week when I told him to stop and that he should take time for himself and also to give me space. He didn't take that well and because of that I had to block him on everything. Some time passed and things were going well for me, until I saw him at my work place. At first I though he was there by accidet but later I learned that he was working there too. (EDIT: I had started working at that place after we broke up and he started working there after me). He knew that I was working there so why on earth would he come to the same place to work? For these few months I have had this weird feeling that I was being watched. I thought I was just paranoid but it was confirmed for me because one day I was going to the dressing room and when I came out I saw him at the end of the corridor behind a glass doors and as he saw me see him he quickly ran away. I didn't see him following me or hear him cause I had my headphones on. So now he knows where my dressing room is. 
    
    I'm honestly scared because idk what he might do and idk what I can do in this situation cause he hasn't actually ""done"" anything. Why would he come to work there anyway? Does someone have an advise on what I can do?",ptsd
"My own Hannibal Lecter Super triggering story, I need to get it off my chest.

When I was 4, my parents (very lately, I know) decided I should be circumcised. I went in, had it done under laughing gas. That night, my mom went to undress me, and when she pulled my underwear, the fresh stitch was caught on it, and it MANGLED my little dick. Super traumatizing, right? 

It gets worse,
Had to go BACK to the hospital that night to get it fixed, and they said I couldn‚Äôt be put under twice in the same day, so my mom and two nurses had to hold my body down while the fixed AND redid the surgery. 

Turns out, the reason it was hard the first time was because I had a birth defect, resulting in an abnormally large urethra (big pee-hole on tip). 

This ordeal gave me a lot of medical anxiety, but also, now that that the problem was exposed, I was pissing in 40 directions at once, and so I had to be in and out of the children‚Äôs hospital until I was 8 for ‚Äúreconstructive surgeries‚Äù, including one 3 week hospital visit where I was in a room with a cancer kid, being rolled around in a wheelchair with a man sized catheter hooked up to me. The nurses were always applying jelly and stuff to my penis, and that coupled with the install and reinstallations of the catheter, I was heavily traumatized and resented having a penis. 

When school started again, I think I was in 3rd grade, teachers noticed I was inattentive, demure, and somewhat hostile / defensive at times. I Was diagnosed as ADHD, and a friend of my mom recommended I see a therapist. 

This is where things got really bad‚Ä¶.

The therapist recommended, I‚Äôll call him Dr. R, belonged to a small non-profit medical association that had its own private estate it ran therapy out of. The company consisted of 4 people, with him being the only one on site. 

They specialized in ‚Äúsick, dying, &/or disadvantaged children‚Äù 

It was a luxurious property, tucked away in the forested mountains. There was a main office, chock full of giant amethyst stones, a grand piano, books and toys galore, that the sessions were meant to happen in. The first time I went, I was with my mom, and I loved him. His vibrato was soft, he sounded wise and kind. At the time, I was only 8, so I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to understand he was most likely a homosexual.

 At first, it was therapy, testing me for ADHD, asking about my home life, what I thought about school. He very quickly pivoted into convincing me I was hyper-intelligent (I was, my IQ is about 150, and I was a very bright young mind), and telling me how different I was, but how that was okay, and that the world wouldn‚Äôt understand me, but he did. This made me very attracted to him (non-sexually obviously I was a little kid), and soon, my mom just started dropping me off, not staying for the 2 hours the sessions lasted. 

When we talked about my penis, I was so desensitized to the verbiage, that I didn‚Äôt understand how the questions he asked were different from the nurses. 

‚ÄúDoes it hurt when I touch it here‚Äù was a line I‚Äôve heard a million times, and he was a doctor, so I figured I should trust him. Didn‚Äôt even see a need to tell my parents my penis was being heavily discussed, let alone the touching. 

This went on for a year or two. Eventually, we were so close, he‚Äôd take me deeper into the compound where his personal home was, along with several other small structures that were still under construction. I remember getting in his truck to drive the half mile in to his house, thinking something felt off, but I had to go with him.

His house was filled with beautiful paintings, decorations and statues. Most of which depicted the naked male form. Again, it was weird, but I didn‚Äôt n ow WHY it was weird. He fed me soup, and would do things like ask me to roll a slinky down the stairs to him (was probably looking up my shorts, I was afraid to wear underwear and he knew this).

He even convinced my parents that since I was one of his favorite clients, he wanted me to pose with some other kids for a billboard / company logo pic.

They agreed, and my pic was on that site until the GOVT took it down last year‚Ä¶
 
Eventually, he flew too close to the sun and asked my mom if he could have me for an entire Saturday for a ‚Äúfree session‚Äù. And when I returned she said I looked groggy, weird, and silent, she pulled me from the program entirely. She thought I‚Äôd been hypnotized.

Nobody say my mom should‚Äôve caught it earlier, everyone thought he was weird, but he was a community staple, and the idea he was doing what he was,  was unthinkable. Also, they expected him to talk about my penis, so I‚Äôm sure my concerns could‚Äôve been wrote off as a boy call wolf situation. But yeah she pulled me, didn‚Äôt tell the police or anything though. I really can‚Äôt remember being raped, but honestly, I don‚Äôt remember more than a few snippets of being up there total, the whole thing feels like a weird blur. It felt like that even just a month after leaving‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt think about that time with him for a long time, until I met another boy in high school who said he had a weird experience with him too. We were both traumatized 13 yr olds who couldn‚Äôt understand what had occurred, but it turned into a fucked-up relationship where we would try sexual things on each other, thinking we were gay. It went on for a year (13-14, his dad was my piano teacher). I also thought I might be trans at this point, but knowing I had all this trauma with my penis, I couldn‚Äôt be sure I could trust those feelings either. 

FF to 8 years later (21 yo), I‚Äôm living across the world, engaged to a beautiful girl, working a 9-5 and paying bills, when Im sent a news article that Dr. R had been accused of grooming and serial raping a 14 yo boy on the same compound at his private residence. Once the boy came out, several men call me, saying they remember me ‚Äújoking‚Äù about being raped by Dr. R in high school, saying they think they were groomed too. I didnt know what to say other than that I was so sorry that happened, and recommended they follow up with the police. 

 Thing is, I called the police a few weeks later and said I had evidence of this happening, and that I can prove I was there. I described his personal house, the compound layout, things only a victim would know about him, they said my story lined up, but my pic on the website was the kicker. Thing is, this was pre-Diddy, and I was too slow to form a class action SA case. Their shitty lawyer helped them foreclose the property, and he‚Äôs been sentenced to 20 years (he‚Äôs already 78 or something) so there‚Äôs nothing I can get from this I don‚Äôt think, no money at least.

No amount of money can fix the levels of fucked up shit he put in my life though. 

I spiraled into drug addiction, cross dressing, self harm, risky sex and dangerous activities for most of high school, survived 2 overdoses, a suicide attempt, and a 3-month psych ward stay where they said I had ‚ÄúPTSD, OCD, BIPOLAR 1 with psychotic features, ADHd, and autism, but wouldn‚Äôt give a 17yo a formal diagnoses for anything. It‚Äôs like they were just throwing darts at a board. I‚Äôm not an insane person. TRULY, I mean that, I‚Äôm a complex person, but I never had hallucinations while sober‚Ä¶

They did however formally drug me with every atypical antipsychotic under the sun, causing extreme weight gain, brain fog, depression and anxiety that made everything worse. At 17 I was 5‚Äô10‚Äù, 130 pounds and was in AP classes across the board (even while in active addiction). By 18, I weighed 215lbs, smoked weed constantly to combat the muscle aches, and had lost 90% of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù due to  my newfound asocial behavior. 

Took years of hard-drug sobriety, therapy (EMDR, CBT, DBT, parts therapy etc.), and good relationships with new people to realize I was capable of coming back down from my years long fugue state, where I had been dissociating 80% of my waking hours. That figure is probably still around 50%, but now that I know my brain didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmake up‚Äù the Dr. R stuff, I feel vindicated, and PISSED THE FUCK OFF.

Truthfully, this started with me hoping this story could help me understand why I‚Äôm understandably confused about my sexuality and gender, but now I‚Äôm just sad this happened to me. I was such a happy-go-lucky kid before, nothing but potential, and while I actively try to be my best self everyday, it just doesn‚Äôt feel fair I had to endure this from so young. I don‚Äôt remember being a kid. I don‚Äôt remember having a good relationship with any older man in my life, I don‚Äôt remember doing things for my own sake, I don‚Äôt remember ever having any control over myself, and now that I do, I‚Äôm even more sad, because life‚Äôs too fucking depressing to ‚Äúre-live‚Äù my childhood in a healthy way. 

I‚Äôm only 22 now, and I know that time heals all, I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôve fallen on a bit of archaic wisdom with the amount of suffering I endured, but fuck, I‚Äôm allowed to feel helpless one last time. I‚Äôm allowed to be scared that I never got the chance to understand myself before the weight of the uncensored world put its pedophealic penis on my shoulders. I just want to feel comfortable in my own skin, with my own body, in my own house, and feel safe, and I just hope it comes sooner than later. 

I want to be a great husband, I want to be a loving father, I want to be an educator who is down to earth, caring and protective. I want to have sex and be able to cum in less than 50 minutes, I want to touch my body and not feel confused about how it should make me feel, I wish I could pee standing up without the other men in the bathroom hearing my piss sizzle like it came from a horse cock. I wish I could wear boxer briefs and see an in-person therapist‚Ä¶.

I wish this never happened‚Ä¶

This was super long and fucked up, if anyone reads to this point, thank you‚Ä¶",ptsd
"TW: Hypervigilant about... This is a trigger warning and a trigger pleading. This post contains the topics of going to tell and topics of faith.  The trigger pleading is, please go all theological or atheological on me. I can only take so much. I already had PTSD from a long coma when I had a series of nightmares and psychotic episodes about being in hell and about being condemned to hell. I lived in horror. Now I'm hypervigilant about trying to be moral, which translates into trying to be perfect. I have to tell myself things like ""It's okay to have an opinion,"" and ""Not every thought can be positive."" I literally flinch, stutter, and stammer when I have intrusive thoughts. I was traumatized by things that didn't happen and now I'm hypervigilant about being things I can't be. I feel like it's doing something weird to my self image. Like the way I see myself is changing, or maybe diverging. On the one hand it's morphing into this canine, evil caricature. On the other hand its like, at 49 years old, seeing myself as an adult of reasonable intelligence who still has time to build a life before I end up old, alone, and broke. What can you do about hypervigilance? I've got intrusive thoughts that, when I don't take tons of Prazosin, are saying all the most terrible things and tearing at me. And the more intrusive thoughts I get about how bad I am, the more hypervigilant I get. I just want to scream, ""I reject the premise!"" That crap didn't happen, they were delusions or hallucinations or whatever the hell you have when you're psychotic.  I don't have to try to be a saint because I was never the antichrist. That last is a little convoluted, but I think it gets the point acrost. Besides bribing my doctor to up my prazosin, does anybody have any advice on how to be less hypervigilant and how to deal with intrusive thoughts?",ptsd

"Thoughts on why this may happen and ways to mitigate it? A few years ago, I re-did my bedroom. A lot of bad things happened in my ""old"" bedroom, but not so much this one. My remodeled bedroom is a safe haven for me, and Im sure I would have loved it when I was a kid. Lots of bright colors, things I collect, and girly things. I thought this change would be good for me, and it has been! But it's also posed a new problem.

 Sometimes, when I am having a panic attack or flashbacks, I start to freakout because I don't think I'm in my bedroom. I feel so un-grounded because so much has changed (ex; I no longer have carpet, my walls are totally different colors, I have a new bed, etc). It's like my brain can't wrap around the fact that I'm stil in my bedroom, and is searching for identifying features of my old one! 

I was wondering if anyone else experienced this sort of thing and, if so, how do you bring yourself back? I'm also so curious as to why this happens!

"Realized I may have PTSD So I am a veteran, not combat, never been overseas to a warzone. I was however a direct report of someone that I did not get along with who murdered his girlfriend (David Michael Vega, can find news articles) as well as being present on base during the 2014 Fort Hood shooting spree. I never thought much or swelled much on it but now that I have a company helping me apply for benefits, things are starting to piece together.

My ever so lovely wife has over the years told me I can be emotionless/uncaring and I can get pretty mean, which is suppose from an outsider perspective is true but I am never violent. I don't have many friends by choice, I avoid crowded areas and generally prefer to be at home which I have a security system watching all entrances that is motion activated to send me alerts. To me, this is just normal and sensible.

After talking to a medical professional of the possibility of having PTSD, it made me realize maybe that is why I am the way I am. My first marriage did not work out and didn't end on great terms as we grew very distant emotionally and went out separate ways and have not communicated since. I also had a contract job I was let go of unexpectedly where they had me go into another building to tell me while they cleaned out my desk ask if they thought I was gonna have a violent outlast or something. I've never been a violent person. 

So yea it's all making me think that I might have PTSD. If the VA approves my claim I plan on talking to a medical professional about it to better understand it and hopefully improve my behaviors with people.",ptsd

"PTSD Anniversary (this is interesting‚Ä¶) I was sexually assaulted in 2016.

At the time of the relationship I didn‚Äôt recognize it as being a bad or unhealthy relationship, but looking back at it I did everything I possibly could to make my ex happy. My ex wasn‚Äôt necessarily violent towards me, but when we were intimate he would be pretty violent and do things I wasn‚Äôt necessarily fond of but didn‚Äôt say no to, because I wanted to please him.

During the end of our relationship I found out he had been cheating the entire time, with more people than I can count. He promised to never do it again, but of course he did and he ended up leaving me for his new partner.

All of it have left me with panic attacks, places I can‚Äôt go because I‚Äôm scared of running into him, friendships that have ended because of him, and a lack of trust to myself.

"One of my big triggers is popping up at work sometimes and I'm frustrated. TW: hospital  I work as a direct support professional which is essentially caregiving for adults with disabilities. Every once in a while one of my clients ends up hospitalized and I have to be at the hospital with them. So far it's only happened twice but the first time it happened I realized that seeing a hospital bed and equipment was a major trigger for me. I was suddenly reliving my trauma when I stepped in the hospital room and all my progress felt like it was reversed. Before this I was just getting over seeing them on tv so I thought I was gonna be okay to be there.

I was just starting to make progress on the overwhelming nightmares and smaller triggers again, when this morning I found out that another client is in the hospital and I would have to take someone to see her. All day I'd been dreading it but was trying to prepare myself. Well, it didn't work. I just calmed down from a panic attack after being in the room and I'm just frustrated that I have to deal with this.

"Is there hope Reddit? Hello everyone,        

I present myself: 35 years old PhD student, I am an European. I have a PTSD diagnosed by multiple people (therapists) due to the fight with a violent disease as a kid. It's not important to tell which one, just it was not cancer. It's a chronic one I still have it but under control. The trauma came from the symptoms, the way the disease was treated and of course the constant bullying at school. I feel a bit embarrassed actually because when I read some stories it looks like I would have no reason to complain. I am often asked to shut up about that btw.     

So anyway, I am not in very good shape,of course I fell into opioids. We don't have the opioid crisis and fentanyl is not really a thing here, that doesn't mean opioid addiction isn't a thing or common, ofc. Hopefully methadone works well so far at a relatively low dose.       

I spent the week with a girlfriend and of course was absolutely panicking and triggered all the time. She told me now she was scared for herself when I was melting down. I would like to emphasize I have never ever in my life physically hurt anyone. I would never have touched her. Of course I understand you can scare someone because it's impressive to see you crying and doing all you can not to explode your head on the wall. I understand it can be scary, I am not here to complain about her reaction which is, after all, rather normal. She lied the whole week she told me about having a good time because she believed she had to protect herself, I understand. I am absolutely heartbroken and in pieces like a broken mirror, but I am not blaming her she did what she thought was the best.

My only question is simple. Is there a way back from this nightmare? I thought I had prepared the best I could but it was a total fiasco. I don't know what to do. Because of my disease I can't even drink away my sadness. I have to face. I am in total and absolute despair and loneliness. Of course her reactions triggered a cascade of memories of when I thought ""well done"" before being said ""mmmmm sorry your emotional reaction"" blabla or ""you looked strange"" (actually tired I haven't touched any psychotrope in years except from the methadone, a lesser evil for me). I am currently living with my parents on top of that.

Anyway, thanks for those who took the time to read me. Have a good day, everyone. English is not my native language, perdon any mistake.",ptsd

I used to stash snacks and water in my room, made sure my tissues were replenished, and always had a lot of random hobbies, books, and other things around too. I asked my bf if he ever did this as a kid, and he thought I was weird. It was like a game to me, and I continued to do it everywhere I stayed as I grew up. I would think to myself, ‚Äúhmm, how long could I survive in my room if I had to lock myself in here for an indefinite period of time? Which stuffed animals HAVE to be with me when things get bad? How long would these snacks and water bottles last me if I rationed them out?‚Äù I never thought about it until I talked to my bf, but now I realize that was not normal behavior. I do think that it was my child-self trying to keep me as safe and prepared as possible, although I‚Äôm  not sure why. Isn‚Äôt that weird? ",ptsd

"Questions for people who did exposure therapy for PTSD Hey all, so I'm working with a team to make a VR app that lets you do exposure therapy virtually to cure social anxiety, PTSD, and different kinds of phobias. We'd love to get your insights!

You don't have to answer all the questions, any response is appreciated!

1. Would you be open to trying a new technology-based approach for managing fears or anxieties if it could save you money compared to traditional therapy? Why or why not?¬†
2. How much do you currently spend (or would you expect to spend) on exposure therapy per month? Would you consider switching to a technology-based alternative if it reduced those costs?¬†
3. If there were a technology that allowed you to experience exposure therapy from the comfort of your home, would you be willing to invest in a VR headset to access it? What factors would influence your decision?
4. How important is flexibility (e.g., time, location) when it comes to choosing therapy options? Would you pay for a subscription-based service that lets you manage your treatment on your own schedule?
5. Would you feel more comfortable paying a one-time fee for an app or subscribing monthly to access a wider range of features and ongoing updates? Why?
6. How much would you be willing to spend monthly for a subscription service that provides effective, at-home exposure therapy experiences?
7. If a subscription-based app offered features like progress tracking, customized experiences, and expert support, would you consider it a good alternative to in-person therapy?¬†",ptsd
"PTSD and Physical injuries are a strange combo.  So about a month ago i tore my ACL and im currently getting treatment. Strangly enough now that im injured i feel so, i dont know, protective over myself? Like, im injured and cant really walk without pain -> im vulnerable and i need to protect myself. Men that get too close to my make me feel like im in danger and god forbid i accidentally stay out past 7 pm which is when the sun sets. Due to this + the pain i feel so defensive and angry, and while my rehab doctor is really kind he is male, though thankfully he has an aprentice with us so i feel safer. 

This is half a vent but also just really intresting to me. Iike, how trauma and PTSD twists an injury from ""ow i am hurt"" to ""this puts me in significant danger as i cannot fight or flee.""

Has anyone experienced this? I feel like its such a weird (and exaughsting) experience.

"Friend is an alcoholic in on and off active addiction. Lost father from alcoholism. In need of advice and support  If you‚Äôre triggered by substance abuse, please don‚Äôt read this any further. To make a long story short, almost a year ago, I became friends with my neighbor. She told me she was newly in recovery from addiction. To be honest, when I heard that, I did start to worry. I lost my father from alcoholism a few years back and have dealt with extensive addiction issues in my family. I‚Äôm diagnosed with CPTSD due to severe childhood abuse and neglect, a lot of that trauma came from the hands of my alcoholic father. This friend talks extensively about her addiction to me, and in April, I had to set boundaries that I can‚Äôt be a support system in the way she‚Äôd like me to be due to my own trauma. Since then, she has relapsed multiple times. She has gone to rehab, came home to her parents that are extremely religious and don‚Äôt at all understand addiction, then she immediately relapsed. She has been drinking and driving. The day before yesterday was her most recent relapse, and I have reason to believe she was drinking and driving again. I have extremely low tolerance for behavior like that, because that‚Äôs something my dad did with me in his car frequently. He could have killed me due to his selfishness, and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôll never forget. I do not take putting other people‚Äôs lives at risk lightly, because of how many times I could have died. Not only that, but I was with my father as he was dying, and she knows that. Anything involving death and potential death I cannot handle.


She wants to see me, but I do not want to see someone in active addiction. I was a people pleaser for years, but lately, I‚Äôve been learning more and more how to prioritize and protect myself. I don‚Äôt think I can remain in this friendship if this keeps reoccurring. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know how to approach this. She knows in detail what I went through with my dad, yet she still thinks that out of all people, speaking to me about her relapses, etc. is acceptable. She put a trigger warning on the text, but quite honestly, that isn‚Äôt enough. I cannot for my own mental health be of any support to her without destroying and triggering myself, having flashbacks, and I don‚Äôt think she gets that. I love her and care about her, but I‚Äôve had some other issues arise within the friendship as well, such as constantly contacting me, then relapsing continently after I don‚Äôt respond, among other things. Which, to be honest, is triggering for me and does make me feel responsible for her. I‚Äôm Autistic and chronically ill, need my alone time, and cannot be with someone physically or be in contact with someone constantly. No matter how many times I try to explain that, it‚Äôs like she never gets it. I don‚Äôt think she at all means for me to feel responsible, but I do. I cannot help someone in active addiction without feeling like their life is in my hands due to what happened with my father and other family members. I quite honestly can‚Äôt even speak about addiction in general without graphic images of my father popping into my head. I can recognize that‚Äôs due to trauma and not her fault, but to protect myself and heal further, I cannot ever feel like I‚Äôm in a situation where I feel responsible for someone ever again. I can recognize that she deserves support, but this is support I cannot provide her. If you have any input or advice you can give me, please do, because I‚Äôm at a loss right now on how to handle this. I worry that anything I say won‚Äôt be received well, especially because of the state that she‚Äôs in. ",ptsd

"Agoraphobia? I want to know if anyone else struggles with this.

"Left a DV relationship and can‚Äôt stop having panic attacks on specific days I (34f) was with this guy (30m) for 3 years. The abuse started in the first 6 months and I kept forgiving and returning because I have mental illness and so does he. I felt like if I left I was abandoning him and that was actually a projection of my own fear of abandonment. 

Finally in September, I called the police and got out of there for good. Went no contact, moved in with family, and got on meds and therapy (currently just telephone therapy every 2 weeks) which I feel like isn‚Äôt enough. 

My whole point of posting is I realized I have 2 really awful days a week, Sunday and Thursday where I‚Äôm extremely anxious, and have frequent intense panic attacks. Then it donned on me that Sunday was the day he went to work and there was always some physical and mental abuse on that day because he didn‚Äôt want to go to work and would take his frustration out on me. Then Thursday was his day off and he would be so angry and grumpy from working we would usually fight pretty badly. 

It‚Äôs just really hard to deal with because on the other days I‚Äôm fine and then it‚Äôs like my body knows it‚Äôs Sunday or Thursday and BOOM I‚Äôm back to feeling like complete shit. 
 
Is this normal with PTSD? To have specific days that trigger you even when you don‚Äôt acknowledge the days? I don‚Äôt know how else to explain it. I just want to move on and feel better but on those days my anxiety meds do nothing and I feel like I‚Äôm going to throw up the entire time.

"Not comfortable going to my good friend‚Äôs house due to dog attack PTSD I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm looking for advice or validation or what, but I‚Äôve been struggling with this for a while and just needed a safe space to get it off my chest. 

I was badly attacked by a dog a few years ago and ended up in the ER. It has given me PTSD and I‚Äôm now very uncomfortable around large dogs. A close friend of mine has 2 large dogs that both belong to stereotypically aggressive breeds. She and her bf are responsible dog owners and the dogs are well-trained and friendly (I spent time around them pre-attack) but I still feel extremely uncomfortable around them. 

It sucks because I have had to decline a number of invitations to social events at her house, but I just know that if I went, I would be anxious the whole time. I also worry that the dogs would sense my anxiety and attack.

On the one hand, I worry that I‚Äôm being paranoid. On the other hand, I think it‚Äôs quite reasonable to be afraid of dogs and that most people should be more cautious than they are.

Has anyone else had to decline social invitations and spend less time with friends due to dog attack PTSD? Any words of wisdom or support? ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

"I'm worried that PTSD might cost me my job I have a great job that I've had for about 8 months. It's a warehouse job with good pay, insurance that pays for therapy, and most importantly a great boss. There are two major problems though. 

1) While the schedule is normally fine and the environment is normally relaxed, when things get busy we have to work extra days and extra long hours. It's not only stressful because of the extra time but also the environment gets very hectic.

2) Part of the job is driving 18 foot trucks for deliveries and pickups. I was doing fine with it at first but unfortunately got into a couple of minor accidents right when I was getting into a good rhythm with it. The driving now makes me incredibly nervous to the point that it's unmanageable with my PTSD symptoms. I've talked to my boss about this and he's been happy to work with me on it. I can't (and don't want to) stop driving all together but I'll only be assigned to easier things for the time being and my boss has told me I can always say no if I'm uncomfortable with something.

The only reason I'm worried about this right now is that I had to leave work today during one of the busiest weeks I've seen because I got overwhelmed, started having flashbacks, and couldn't pull myself together. I also missed work a couple weeks ago because of a meltdown that kept me up until 4am the night before. I feel like it's gonna snowball until I miss too much or can't do enough and they end up letting me go.

"Ongoing amnesia? I have been talking with my therapist about my dissociation and he recently said that my dissociative episodes were part of my PTSD. I will talk to him about this, but I haven't gotten to it yet: I do definitely experience derealization/depersonalization, but I also experience periods of amnesia (I guess?).

When I read about amnesia and PTSD I mostly see discussions of amnesia around the trauma, which I have. However, I also experience loss of time on a regular basis, and it feels different than my other dissociations (in fact, it feels like nothing at all, because I just realize time has passed and I don't know what happened during that time).

I experience this on a daily basis for what must be short periods of time (maybe 10-30 minutes?), but I have experienced longer lapses in time. For example, in undergrad I remember heading to my 1:00 class at 12:45, walking straight there, and then when I arrived, everyone was gone and I realized it was about 4:30, but I had no memory of what had happened over the last few hours. It is like I'm time travelling.

I also have memory loss that I think might be related, such as people knowing who I am and my friends telling me that I've met them multiple times, but I have no idea who they are. Also sometimes I will see men on facebook or in person who I feel like there is a 50/50 chance I hooked up with them but I just can't remember (though this makes more sense to me because my trauma seems to relate to men). And I have dated men for several months who I really liked, and then I completely forgot they existed until many months later and then it was too late since I appeared to have ghosted them.

"Is PTSD genetic or not? A prevalence rate found in the 1950s suggests that about 10% of World War II soldiers had PTSD at some point; (Same trenches, same shelling, same conditions. Why only 10%, if not genetic?)
We will immediately think that they had a genetic predisposition, but we don't know how their childhood went, it is very possible that those 10% have lived in an emotional environment, depressed and had childhood trauma (did not receive support from the family
after trauma) the tragedies of the war have already caused PTSD.

"Struggling immensely in college, need advice on what steps I should take next. For context, I'm trans MTF, I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome and ADD(which would now be considered Autism and ADHD) at an early age, my parents are divorced(both with new spouses), and I have had at least one prior traumatic event to this(I honestly don't know if I have forgotten trauma, I would say it is likely though since I believe my (self diagnosed)ptsd started when my parents were going through their breakup, which was when I was 5).

Ever since the start of the lockdown(I was in the 8th grade at the time) my grades have gradually been declining as so has my mental wellbeing. During the start of high school I was still doing okay in class, although I knew it wasn‚Äôt going to be that way for long, I was a stupid teenager so I never did anything about it back then because as long as I passed, my grades didn‚Äôt really matter to me. In grade 10 I decided to be stupid and started vaping, weed and nicotine, and hung out with ‚Äúthat‚Äù kind of group. I also started cutting myself at around this time.

During grade 11, My parents found out I was cutting myself, my dad lifted one of my sleeves during DINNER, IN PUBLIC because he suspected it(looking back it was quite obvious I was), once we got home he basically just told me to stop doing it(I don't remember the full conversation but that's basically how it went), he showed almost no sympathy. later on in the year I lost my job one day and my dad physically assaulted me, and we yelled and screamed at each other and it got very personal(specifics, I couldn't stand it anymore so I ran out of the house(there's more to the story, I‚Äôm just trying to keep this short), I called my mother, who called the cops. My mom told me to run to a location, where my grandfather was and I was (physically)fine from there. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING came from this. The police did ABSOLUTELY JACK SHIT even though there should have been evidence, because of the camera's inside of my fathers house. This was the only time that I can remember he physically abused me, but he‚Äôs always been emotionally abusive. After the incident, I decided I didn‚Äôt want to see my dad for a while. This only lasted a few months before I decided to give in to him pleading with me to come back. The results of this are quite obvious, more emotional abuse but never physical. Eventually I decided to live with my mom again full time, although I did still see my dad once every while. I ended up getting another job at a grocery store. It was around this time I started trying to come out to some of my social group. I also stopped hanging out with the group I was in currently because obviously they wouldn't accept me as most of the group was edgy boys, I never stopped vaping nicotine and weed. now I was more-so hanging out with ""computer nerds"" and the like. I had always been interested in technology, and was really into gaming, I decided I wanted to be a game designer.

During grade 12 I continued to hangout with this group and things we're good overall, apart from my grades still. One day I heard there would be a party and that a lot of my friends would be going, I went, had a good time, and left. Then the next party came around and I left that party in an ambulance because I didn't know that 1. I had low blood pressure and 2. that weed lowers your blood pressure, and when your blood pressure drops too low, it'll cause a syncope. My parents both wanted me to get at least a college diploma and I wanted to as well. I just wanted to take a year off of school to focus on my mental health, but NOPE, my mom and sister ended up basically forcing me otherwise(their reason being if I take one year off it would turn into 2,3,4 years, etc) and I applied to an advanced program for computer programming at the same college my sister was/is attending. at this point I was getting mostly 50's and 60's. but the one class I was struggling with most was my coding class. I just didn't do any of the work because I talked to my friends the entire class, I would have probably gotten around 20% if it weren't for my amazing teacher, who I kind of lied to, saying I was just burnt out. He let me pass with a 50. I kind of regret telling him I was burnt out, I should have let myself fail, it would have been for the better I think.

After my 18th birthday I had to stop seeing my therapist as they only help with children. I started estrogen and hormone blockers, but after a month haven't gotten any since I suck with remembering appointments(actually I suck at remembering in general now). I ended up getting into literally the only college I applied to, anyways, here I am now, 7 weeks of past due work and getting about 0% in all but 2 of my 6 classes. I've tried the free tutoring the college offers already but that hasn't worked because it's been too slow. going forward, my mother suggested I stop taking estrogen temporarily because I'm not ready for the emotions it brings, which is fair, and she said I should start taking Adderall again(I was on Adderall for a little while during elementary school and it helped me with focusing). I've contacted my student success advisor and have a meeting with them tomorrow, and I'm going to see about switching my program to something hopefully more achievable.

This is all really worrying to me because mainly it's my education, but also because my dad actually paid for it and he's quite obviously unpredictable with his decisions.

At this point I don't even care I was wronged and just want to see if I can finish my education, then get the professional help I need, so any advice is great, feel free to ask questions if you have any. I know I'm most likely just fucked in this scenario but I want to at least try. Sorry for the long rant, I just feel as if my issues are deep rooted and I need to give an entire life story about them for people to properly understand me, and if this isn't allowed here I am willing to take it down.

also I want to mention that I am **not** diagnosed professionally and currently am still figuring everything out.",ptsd

"Tried psilocybin and left despaired after reliving all my traumas on loop. Worried what a second trip will be like. The tl;dr version:

I had immense childhood trauma due to nearly dying from health issues several times that I always pushed away for nearly four decades. I have spent all these years constantly afraid of dying and losing my loved ones, and suppressing those thoughts when they popped up. I've lived with chronic anxiety. I did lots of therapy and medications, but nothing worked. I heard psilocybin does wonders for mental health. Recently, I went on my first trip ever, a facilitated 2.5g shroom/25mg psilocybin trip and it was horrific because I relived all of my traumas on repeat and felt utter despair that anything bad could happen to me or my loved ones at any moment and there is nothing I can do. I was left destroyed, just hopeless and despaired. Days later, all I have are the memories of my traumas in the forefront and hopelessness about life. I am scheduled for another 2.5g shroom/25mg psilocybin trip in a few days and am worried that it will be the same and am worrying if it's a good idea for me to do. I was wondering if anyone has experience with trying psilocybin with their PTSD and if there's any hope that the second trip will be different and healing.

The details:

I nearly died multiple times in childhood and had multiple horrifying medical experiences. Afterwards, I was left very anxious and frightened all the time, but like the doctors told me to, I pushed the bad memories away and tried not think about them. For nearly the four decades since, I have been constantly anxious to the point it impacted my ability to get an education or have a job or do anything with my life. I've spent these years always afraid of dying and of losing my loved ones and constantly pushing those thoughts out of my head. I tried loads of therapy and loads of medications, but nothing ever worked even the slightest.

Recently, I got into a program where I could (legally) try two 25mg doses of psilocybin (2.5 grams in shrooms) with a facilitator present and non-directive prep and integration sessions (basically them hearing me out, but not giving any instructions or feedback). I had heard that psilocybin does wonders for mental health issues and allows you to see things different and reduce anxiety. I did the first trip recently and it was awful. I was forced to relive all of traumas I'd been suppressing on a loop, having them happen again and again over those hours. The only thoughts in my head on repeat for the whole trip were that anything bad could happen to me or my loved ones at any moment and there is nothing I can do. I felt and still feel utter despair and immense pain. I cried the whole time. The facilitator tried to comfort me throughout and was attentive, but nothing helped. I left completely drained with memories of my traumas at the forefront and fear and hopelessness about how anything could happen to me or those I love at any moment. I've been stuck like this for days. I'm having trouble sleeping and cannot engage in activities I once found even slightly comforting because all I can think about is impending doom and all I feel is constant fear.

I am scheduled for a second trip with the same dose (cannot be lower) in a few days and I don't know whether it's a good idea. The facilitator said it could be good because I've been suppressing/avoiding all my childhood traumas and now they're on the surface and another dose might allow me to discover more about myself that hasn't come out yet. I'm worried that what I'll experience again is hours of reliving my traumas, being bombarded with thoughts of death and feelings of complete despair. I'm wondering if it could destabilize me even further and I'm scared of being like the me just 20 years ago who was afraid to even go outside alone or turn off the lights to go to sleep.

I'm looking for advice or insight from those who have experience with psilocybin for their PTSD and whether there is any hope that going on another trip could provide me with healing rather than just brutal exposure to my trauma and fear. ",ptsd
"The only thing in my life that brings me joy is my partner who cheated on me! TLDR: Nothing in my life brings me joy except for my partner. It's gotten so bad that I stayed with him even after finding out he'd been cheating on me throughout our entire relationship.

I‚Äôm a college student in my twenties. I know the word ‚Äútrauma‚Äù gets thrown around a lot nowadays but throughout my whole life I have been severely traumatized multiple times. From multiple suicides over terminal illnesses in my close family to having to survive severe domestic abuse and sexual assault.
Yet I am still grateful for the good things in my life. I was born into financial stability. I have incredibly supportive friends. I am physically healthy and I have been able to experience a lot of beautiful things.

Although I am grateful and I practice gratitude, I feel like I haven‚Äôt experienced actual joy since I was a little kid. I go on a lot of adventures with my friends. I travel. I go to concerts, movies, festivals, museums, good restaurants but I don‚Äôt feel joy. Sometimes I get a sense of fun from these activities but even then - once I get home, I am back to being trapped in my miserable mindset.

I feel like no matter how hard I try, I won‚Äôt get better. For years I have been going to the gym and practiced different sports multiple times a week. I eat healthy. I drink very rarely and don‚Äôt do any other drugs. I get enough sleep. I stay on top of my self care routine. I keep my place clean. I do well in college. I have been in therapy and working on my mental health problems for over a decade. Tried different therapists, doctors, therapy approaches, medications. I talk to my friends. I support my community. I am open to new things. I practice positive thinking. I go out in nature regularly. I get my bloodwork done and my physical health is great. I also make sure I don‚Äôt obsess over leading a perfectly healthy life. I let myself rest when I need it.

And still, I am unhappy. All the time basically. The only time I feel happy is when I am in love and I am loved by (or at least get attention from) a man. No matter how much love and attention I get from my friends and family it doesn‚Äôt bring me nearly as much joy as romantic love.
When I am in a relationship, I turn into the happiest person alive. I could puke glitter and rainbows because I get so high off romantic love.
This addiction has led me to stay in incredible toxic, often life-threatening, dangerous situations.

My boyfriend and I started dating 8 months ago. I truly love this man. We have so many things in common and there‚Äôs not one dull moment when we‚Äôre together. Everything I do is for him. He‚Äôs told me multiple times that he has never had a woman care for him like I do and I believe him. It is borderline insane how hard I try to make him happy. This is my third serious relationship. Recently I have found out that he has been cheating on me online since the day he asked me to be his girlfriend. I am so incredibly hurt. I get physically sick to the point of throwing up thinking about it and my thoughts won‚Äôt stop racing. The only time I feel okay again is when I am with him. (As dumb as it sounds, I believe him when he says he loves me. I knew from very early on that due to his own childhood wounds he has an extreme need for validation. I just didn‚Äôt know that he would go looking for it in other women. I want to be optimistic, but I have a very hard time believing that he will change.)

I just want to stop being dependent on men. I want to be able to experience happiness outside of a relationship. I want to be content enough with my life to a point where I don‚Äôt need to stay in terrible relationships because it‚Äôs the only way I can feel okay for once. I feel like I have tried so many things to build a nice life for myself but nothing works. Is there anyone else who has felt like this and was able to fix their problem?",ptsd

"Boundaries  Hi just wonder how other ptsd suffers react to other people setting boundaries.

I have ptsd.

I dated a couple of people with PTSD they both saw me setting boundaries as a personal attack, got angry and shut me out.  I am very cautious in how I do this because of my history, there was no anger or aggression or personal criticism.  

Silent treatment is a major trigger for me so I would really like to understand, is this a ptsd reaction? 

Anyone who has overcome this?

"TRIGGER WARNING - Help? Trauma Response to Seeing Young Children The past few months, especially these past two weeks have been the toughest time in life. I‚Äôm not going to get into all of it - primarily, I witnessed and interacted with unintentionally, a deceased baby while working down in the SE, US after the recent catastrophic storms. 

My main issue has been now, I can‚Äôt deal with seeing, hearing, or feel any joy when I encounter young children. Worst of all is that I have a newborn nephew, but have since asked family to not send any more photos or videos of them because I can‚Äôt get that dead infant, or it‚Äôs poor siblings who were with their mother (squatters) out of my head. 

I‚Äôve progressively gotten worse, have tremors while working in the heat, doing dangerous work, while driving, and have experienced what a trauma therapist confirmed is now two major psychotic breaks that genuinely have me terrified.

The desire for any sort of comfort from someone is equally met with absolute repulsion to talking, being touched, or letting anybody get a glimpse of how I truly feel. The mask is getting heavier to wear but the prospect of it falling won‚Äôt let me allow it to the degree I‚Äôve had many instances of crying, laughing, and screaming all at once in my vehicle. 

Work down here is so overwhelming, but I can‚Äôt leave yet as it‚Äôs vital I put as much effort in as possible to make the amount I need to get through the winter.

"Alternative word for ‚Äòtrigger‚Äô? I have needed to explain the details of my condition a lot recently, not just to medical professionals, but also to non-medical people such as friends , family, and colleagues.

I really don‚Äôt like using the term ‚Äòtrigger‚Äô or ‚Äòtriggered‚Äô when describing my response to certain stressful stimuli or reminders of past trauma. 

It makes me think of the insult used in memes etc. against people that are perceived to be ‚Äòsnowflakes‚Äô or excessively woke. I feel like the term has been hijacked so that it has underlying negative connotations now, and has been adapted into a veiled insinuation of weakness.

Does anyone else feel the same way? Am I overthinking it? Are there any alternatives that people have used so I can avoid the term?",ptsd

"How to help my husband cope? Background: my husband is a navy veteran. He got out 8 months ago, and I do believe that caused his ptsd to be worse. He's been throwing himself into work and I have been desperately trying to find a work from home job but am so far, unsuccessful, so him quitting his job is just not feasable at this point. We have been trying to get the ball rolling with the VA but it's been slow going. We do not make enough to afford therapy through our health insurance but this health insurance was all we could afford. Financially, we are barely making ends meet at this point and I can tell it frustrates and depresses my husband that he works so many hours a week and we can still barely afford groceries and rent at the same time. I've tried to find small jobs to do so that he could afford therapy even just 1-2x a month but I can't find anything long term that would allow me to stay home with our son, and we can't afford daycare either. We are very much stuck between a rock and a hard place until he gets his first VA appointment to establish care and can seek therapy through the VA.

I'm looking for advice on how to help him cope with everything until we can get him to be seen at the VA. They keep canceling and rescheduling appointments further and further out and I can tell my husband is struggling. Its just getting worse and worse. I'm scared and I don't want to lose him. I know that nothing except therapy is going to truly help but I just need him to make it until he can actually be seen by a therapist.

"Help identifying physical responses? I will be keeping everything vague here, but recently I was able to recall an event from when I was about 4 or 5 years old. I decided to share my memory with my stepfather since I‚Äôve always gone to him for support, but when I tried to put words to what had happened, I felt a slew of physical sensations I can‚Äòt say I‚Äôve ever felt in response to my emotions before.

I felt heat, almost like a hot flash, and my chest felt incredibly heavy. I realized after a moment that my breathing was a bit shallow, and that it felt more laborious than normal. My heart was pounding. I could feel it in my throat, and my stepdad told me he could feel it as I sat flush against his side. But what stood out to me most was how I couldn‚Äôt seem to talk. I knew the words I wanted to say, but it was like they just got caught in my throat. I felt myself tense when I tried to push through it. I was eventually able to recall it verbally, but I‚Äôve been left wondering what happened ever since.

What exactly was going on? Is there a term for this? Has anyone else experienced this in similar situations?",ptsd

My case is complex. It's severe and probably a little unusual - falls somewhere between DV/SA and war related PTSD. Almost every therapist I've met with has given me the same feedback - that they are not able to help me. I appreciate that they are able to communicate that instead of just taking my money and not helping me in the meantime.

"Odd moment of clarity  I've just had a very disturbing moment that I need to talk about, and am curious to hear others' stories if anyone relates to this. 

CW for SA, as flair states.

I have been in abusive relationships for over a decade, and recently realized (as I'm having intense flashbacks and regressive symptoms) that I hadn't been allowing myself the space to cope or process. 

The past year has been rough, mentally. I've had increasingly worse flashbacks with subsequent outbursts and verbal shutdowns, and feelings of emotional regression. Simultaneously, I feel safer than I think I ever have and am grateful to have a solid support network and healthy home environment.

It's 1:30 in the morning and I've just gotten out of the shower after trying unsuccessfully to sleep. Insomnia has been rampant. 

As I'm drying off, I'm talking myself down from anxiety, assessing why I feel so wound up every time I get into bed even after nearly falling asleep all day. 

*""I'm not going to be raped, here.""*

This thought is so stark, so heavy and sudden, I feel like the wind has been knocked out of me. 

I don't have to worry about waking up to someone on top of me. I don't have to carefully assess the energy in my bed before drifting off, don't have to save strength to perform things I don't want to so I can go to sleep. I don't have to worry about a fight breaking out, or feeling disgusting. I don't have to be afraid when my partner's arm falls across my waist, or they snuggle up against me. 

Nothing I don't want to happen is going to happen to me while I'm resting after a long day. No one is leering at me. I don't have to cover up to avoid being objectified in my own bedroom. I don't have to be afraid of my clothing choices, the scents I wear, the way I move or sit or speak. Hypervigilance has no home, here. I can just *be*.

This feels so abnormal, but I've had this safety for a year now.

My bed is a place of respite and peace. There are no battles to be won or territories to defend. I am safe. I am not going to be raped, here. ",ptsd
"Almost got fakeclaimed trying to share my story for awareness Last summer, I was creating advocacy content for awareness on my lived experience with PTSD and online trauma. One day, one of my videos blew up (it got more than 10K views). I was really excited when it blew up, and I was really really pumped to answer people‚Äôs comments and to be able to educate people on this topic through my lived experience. This was when things started to escalate, and the videos started reaching the wrong people. Someone started claiming that I was faking my disorder for clout, and began sending my videos to some of their friends. I immediately blocked said person as well as their friends who knowingly watched my videos.

But that didn‚Äôt end from there. As people got to see more of my videos from there, they started claiming that I was stuck in a victim mentality and that I wasn‚Äôt taking accountability for wallowing, and that I was ignoring advice from therapists.

I‚Äôve never seen fake concern trolls be so ignorant as this. I was really looking forward to sharing my own experience for awareness, but then those fakeclaimers decided to ruin it and fuck my digital footprint over.

I have now fully privated my TikTok account where no trolls can reach me; only my trusted followers and mutuals can. They (along with my actual therapist/doctors) know me better than these awful concern trolls do.

Edit: for those saying not to read the comments, I do wish it were that easy. It was practically impossible to not read the mean comments, because I had to read the filtered  comments in case someone had a question for me and it didn‚Äôt go through since TikTok‚Äôs filtering system can be really strict sometimes.",ptsd

"Can anybody help? Any Lawyers Out There?

First, what I will say is I‚Äôve avoided posting this for 3 years, ever since it happened, because my shame was too big to even post this anonymously. 

I grew up being physically abused by my father. The ministry removed me from this household when I was 16 and eventually ended up living with my ‚Äúwhite people family‚Äù - or so I called them. They walked me through a lot of pain and trauma, and spiritually helped me regain my faith in Christ. 

One day, I set a boundary with my informally adoptive mom, and it ended up really triggering her, and she was in a daze. We agreed to take some time apart and she went out with her husband to the grocery store. 

When they came back, she was still in a daze and my informally adoptive father immediately went up to me and demanded that I speak with him in the garage. 

At this point I‚Äôm really confused, but also triggered. Because being asked by a grown man to meet me somewhere like the garage feels unsafe. I try telling him that whatever is going on is between his wife and I, and that I didn‚Äôt feel safe going to the garage with him at that moment. I wanted to talk to the wife to see what was going on, but she went in the pantry and hid. 

At this point, he grabbed me and started dragging me to the garage and with everything I tried resisting him and trying to flee. In doing so his shirt got ripped and he was bleeding from me trying to get his hands off me. He grabbed me by the neck and slammed me on the ground and started strangling me. I tried to scream for someone else in the house and he just said ‚Äú___ is not home right now‚Äù. I tried to call 911 but he took my phone and threw it across the floor. I was losing consciousness. I thought that was it. 

Somehow I escaped at the last moment and ran to my adoptive mom. I was absolutely triggered and in shock and I asked her what the hell she was doing hiding in the pantry not doing anything. She asked me ‚Äúwhat do you want me to do? Haven‚Äôt i loved you enough?‚Äù I was so enraged by her response with her awareness of my history of abuse and my own biological mother‚Äôs lack of action in the abuse, I went crazy and tried to ‚Äúshow her‚Äù what I wanted her to do which was to call the police or intervene, so I started strangling her, knowing my adoptive father would call the cops. 

I went balistic. I had never done anything like this before. But I just couldnt understand what I had done to warrant not being protected by my second mother. My adoptive father did the exact same thing my father did to me growing up, only a thousand times worse, and my adoptive mom just stood there asking me what I wanted her to do in response to her husband strangling the life out of me. 

I could hear my adoptive father on the phone telling the cops I was being abusive (which yes I was) and that I was ‚Äújust some girl who lived with them who was mentally ill‚Äù‚Ä¶

When the cops came, they blamed me for what I did but did not listen to me when I said that he strangled me first - they said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anyone bleed like that before!‚Äù He was referring to my adoptive father‚Äôs ripped shirt and bloodied arms from me scratching at him to try and get him off of me. They treated me like dirt and I got kicked out of the house and my ‚Äúfather‚Äù didnt tell them what he did while I admitted to what I did. 

When I went to ER they said I almost died as he had popped quite a few blood vessels in my neck. I had countless scratches and bruises and sustained a tear in my wrist (TFCC tear) that prevented me from working for the next 3 years. 

I was denied victim services because they went based off of my adoptive father‚Äôs report, and even though i made a report telling the police everything that he did and admitting everything that i did. 

I lost countless friendships after this incident as I either could not trust them or I was too suicidal for them to be around. 

I now live with my abusive parents because I‚Äôm too unwell to work enough to be able to afford my own place. 

I lost everything. 

I dont know what to do. He works at a church, claiming to be a Christian, and I too dont know how to live with myself after what I‚Äôve done. I feel so alone in this world and my faith is also shaken too.

I forgot to mention. Before this incident took place, there was a time where he grabbed my wrists and left bruises but I was told by Christians that it was ‚Äúmy trauma‚Äù and that i should forgive him and trust him because its what ‚Äúfathers do out of lovingly protection‚Äù. Not knowing any better I trusted this, thinking God was wanting me to forgive, hence it now being hard to trust in God anymore too/trust what I think I hear from Him. 

I‚Äôve called countless Legal Aid resources only to be told no one can help me because of the complexity of my situation. 

After all of this... My question is - is there any hope for me? Are there any lawyers out there or anyone who knows what I can do? I just want the truth to be told. I‚Äôm ok if I go to jail for it. But he still to this day will not admit what he has done and I have lost so much because of it. I also want to heal from my own actions because I know what I did was not okay.

"TW: Domestic Violence / Experiences Tw: S/A mention (not in detail)

Hi all!

This is going to be a bit of Support/Vent but it wouldn't let me pick two flairs so I wanted to be transparent as to what this entails

I am new to this subreddit as I finally caved between therapy sessions and realized I need some support from people who understand.

I was in a DV relationship for 5 years and continued to be a support for the person for 3 years after. It was physical and emotional abuse as well as S/A. I have been struggling constantly to cope with the feelings of loss and rage and sadness and the empty feeling of not being able to access the same love and emotions I could with my abuser. Sometimes it feels like we were married, we never were but I felt like I had a connection with them on a level deeper than I have the capacity for anymore- which is strange because towards the end I didn't even want to be in a relationship with them. I don't feel how I did toward the end of the relationship when I have emotional triggers- I feel like I'm staring at the version that messed me up the most (1 to 2 years in to the relationship)

I am in a loving relationship now and have been for two years but I have realized that not all the memories I have are bad but they all hurt the same. I thought flashbacks were only negative moments? I can mostly forget about the memories in my day to day but when I'm reminded it floods back all the good and bad and makes me enraged and upset to the point of crying and wanting to scream. I don't necessarily get visual flashbacks like I'd expect to but I have a rush of emotion where I feel like the feelings in my body need to come bursting out it feels like I'm standing in the room with them again. It feels like I'm looking right at them.

People keep telling me to write letters and burn them but I'm so angry and upset I just want closure and I can't figure out how to heal - the only closure I can see is being able to get it out directly to the person as nothing else seems to work and no one understands this.

I went without triggers and nightmares for a long time but suddenly it's flared up again for seemingly no reason. With no specific trigger.

I guess I just want to know.. have you experienced this? Why is it suddenly back? How can I reconnect with others? How can I trust again and feel love? I feel so tired, I'm exhausted and it feels like I lost a piece of me with my ex and that I can't recover it. I can't stand intimacy as it makes me feel gross and I struggle to express my love for others. It's gotten so bad I literally start bawling once a week because I feel my current partner deserves better but I am on the road to finding medications that work for me and I'm starting EDMR after years of CBT not working. I just don't know who I am without him and I've been running for a long long time. 

Thank you for listening.

And for those who feel the same I wish nothing but healing and unconditional support for us on our journeys.",ptsd

I always feel like a fraud, even as someone who is diagnosed, because the thing that gave me PTSD was not nearly as bad as other stories I've heard. I feel weak because my experience is nothing compared to so many others. Does anyone else ever feel this way? Has anyone ever ""gotten over"" the feeling of not being ""traumatized"" enough? How did you do it?",ptsd
"What was the most irrational thing you did in the acute stress period? I‚Äôve recovered a lot from the initial response and just not being in my right mind, but I still carry a lot of guilt for the way I acted, once or twice in very public settings.

Today though I was certain I saw the man that caused it. Except there was nobody there and absolutely without a doubt he wouldn't have been there. It's happened about three times today.

It's some sort of visual hallucination. Is that known to occur with PTSD?

Maybe I'm going crazy. ",ptsd
"C-PTSD and experiences with either anxiety medication, or anti-depressants, as well as alternative medicines  Hello all! I'm asking for some personal experiences (hoping for some positive ones and not only negative, though honesty is always appreciated.)

I was diagnosed with moderate to severe Complex PTSD in 2019. Since then, I've been on and off going to talk therapy, and trying natural management at home the best I can.

I have had a lot of fear of starting medicine over the years related to side effects, dependency, withdrawal, and not wanting to gain a ton of weight (I don't care about a few lbs. But I am quite  active and want to be able to stay that way). I also have two addicts for parents, and two siblings who have also struggled with addiction, so I have been very hesitant to start anything that could have high addiction/withdrawal potential. 

I have made some vast improvements mentally as far as perspective goes towards myself, my trauma and my life, but my physician, psychiatrist and counselor agree that though my mind is making progress, my body seems to have endured disregulation for so long that it's unable to get out of that cycle on its own. My counselor has encouraged me to explore options for medication (especially anxiety related medicine). 

After 5 long years of fighting it I started on sleep medicine. It took several tries and I'm currently taking Lunesta, which seems to work during certain times and not others. (I tried hydroxyzine, doxepin, Quviviq, Trazadone, and this. All the other meds didn't work or gave me horrible side effects that were unsafe or unbearable). I also have some experience with psylocibin mushrooms, which were profoundly helpful in my healing, but aren't always easy to access or physically easy to use in my area. 

I'm also starting ketamine injection appointments and would love to hear about the process and results that ketamine has brought for some of you. 

My biggest symptoms seems to be insomnia. I've struggled with it for well over a decade, and it has increasingly gotten worse. All over the counter sleep aids and herbs have all eventually stopped working. My doctor and counselor think that the insomnia is caused by anxiety related to disregulation from sleep and my room not being a safe place for me for a long time. I used to have frequent nightmares, but now I'm not sleeping well enough to dream most nights. 

Many of my other symptoms have improved with years of work, but my quality of life suffers immensely from the lack of rest and the feelings of anxiousness at times. I wake up everyday never feeling rested, always exhausted everyday. I've tried quitting stimulants, trying natural mood and cognitive enhancing nootropics etc, and I'm really struggling with this. 

My question is for those of you who may have similar issues with sleep and anxiety - what have you tried, as far as SSRIs, SNRIs, anxiety medicine, etc, and what helped you? Have they greatly improved your quality of life or quality of sleep in some way? Was it/is it worth it? Did you discontinue them at some point and how bad was it? 

Any and all information is appreciated.

"I wrote this today. (Need advice) My Anxiety thru my whole life. 

Whenever i go in a professional setting where i get judged, my anxiety comes back as clockwork.

Pulse rising, chest tightening, breathing harder, stomach clenched, and muscles especially in the neck tightens. I feel like I'm standing on the top of a building, and about to fall over. Feels like death.

I know now where it stems from. My father was always critisizing me, and giving me chores, and then scream at me when they wasn't done right. Or throw stuff at me. He also put me in situations where I wasn't comfortable, like signing me up for sports I didn't wanna do. And one time he put me on a theatre stage to audition, and I had absolutely no desire to. 

Sometimes he got so angry at me, that he chased me out of the house, or even at one time, he threw me out of my home - he packed some suitcases and told me I had to move out in rage. Not sure what I had done. I must have been 13 or 14 at that time. His screming and hardness frightened me. He also wrote me a letter where he told me I was not good for the family, and I wouldn't amount to anything. 

I am still - to this day afraid I'll be homeless. I'm still having the feeling of doom over my head every day. I get extremely fearful when I have to be judged, and I feel very unloved - and I'm afraid of conflict. 

This has colored my whole life. I'm not afraid of people in a general setting, and I can be very social. But I'm constantly afraid to get hurt, og judge people around me. And I have been hurt a lot of times. 

As a kid I was bullied a lot, and I'm sure this goes into the equation also. 

I'm now 53. I keep getting stuck, but I also had a big and good life with many friends, and took many chances.  I'm very good at my job - I'm a music producer, and had many successes despite feeling this terror. I found a way.   
  
But I keep doubting myself. I keep going back to ""black"" and feeling helpless. I guess that's why I never got a family. I have learned about myself that I was afraid to collapse ‚Äì¬†if I couldn't take care of myself ‚Äì¬†how would I take care of others? 

---- Back Story ----

I've read and studied trauma for 10 years. I've been broken down from anxiety. Helpless. I have had trouble sleeping and functioning for many years. But yet, I feel like I'm managing my anxiety better every day. BUT - I still have that feeling of terror when I have to go to a meeting or meet people of influence. 

I've been to therapy. 3 times in my life (not 3 sessions - but 3 x let's say 20 sessions. I've talked to friends about this. I understand from a theoretic standpoint what's going on, but the feeling persist. I've done meditation for 7 years, I exercise and I eat right. I have learned self compassion. 

When I tried so much. Can anyone please suggest what the next step could be? I'm writing here, because I'm really feeling I need a new perspective. 

Thank you in advance. ",ptsd
"I finally decided to go permanent no contact. Advice on how to continue with day to day stuff as I process this? Yesterday, I was fully recreated into a ‚Äúbad object‚Äù again, taking the mantel with my mother and grandfather and grandmother and sister.

After blocking him when he said he was cutting me off after not responding for 26 hours, my father emailed me from unknown emails and texted from unknown numbers, using subject headings like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù before piling on abuse.

The wild part is that this time I actually never said anything. I got angry when he said he was cutting me off again after I failed to respond for 26 hours (while in Vermont with no power, to a MacRumor) and said the angry things I had to say to my step mother, who recently promised over and over again that I can talk about anything related to my father to her because she understands the hurt and anger and can separate what I have to say from the relationship she has. Well, she took those things straight to my father. At least some of them.

With my only recent input having being for him to not discuss family stuff with me while I work through CPTSD from childhood trauma like 3 weeks ago (SINCE I have FaceTimed and regularly texted to check in) as well as whatever my step mother decided she needed to tell him I said, he sent me a 12 point bullet list of why I‚Äôm a terrible person from every angle and outlining the damage I‚Äôve caused without actually mentioning how or to who (him? I mean come the fuck on I was a child!).

It shook me so badly I reached out to my mom and siblings to ask about said ‚Äúdamage‚Äù and they basically laughed me out of the room. It took like five attempts for them to realize I was seriously asking if I‚Äôd caused comparable damage to my father. But like always, he was just saying what hurts the most. What would stick with me.

So now I finally understand he most likely has BPD that is not being treated. I didn‚Äôt understand that my sister was a ‚Äúbad object‚Äù these last 5 years, I heard a very different side of the story. But we finally connected and talked about it, and I heard some of the things he said to her - things he would not dream of telling me he told her. Outright lies, and mean ones. I was living in an illusion for years, when you‚Äôre in his good sights it feels really good. You feel special and important and accepted.

But that is conditional. It can pivot on a dime, and it just did. I just got really good at staying in his good graces for awhile there.

So yesterday I made the decision to permanently go no contact. He‚Äôs taking ‚Äúuntil November 1st to protect himself‚Äù - so far he‚Äôs sent me abuse from unknown numbers every day he spends ‚Äúprotecting himself‚Äù but I guess I‚Äôm just so dangerous he has to pre-protect himself by attacking me over and over.

I‚Äôm trying to work through my childhood PTSD while new small traumas are created with this man. It is hard. I talked to my fiance and she‚Äôs going to help me not go back into the fold, is sad about the whole situation but agrees with the decision and is cutting them off as well.

How do you cope on a day to day basis? What tools do you use to do you daily activities when this stuff is at the forefront of your mind?

**TLDR: My most likely BPD father was intensely abusive growing up, like a true crime childhood level of psychologically abusive. I thought he‚Äôd worked through it but after a decade or so I‚Äôve found myself as the ‚Äúbad object‚Äù again, which I‚Äôd been for the majority of my childhood. He‚Äôs been hurling abuse for days from unknown numbers and emails as I try to heal. It is hard. Need advice.**",ptsd
"Finding Hope I never once thought what was wrong with me could be cured and this made me lose all hope in ever feeling normal again. I tried to look back at my past and pinpoint the exact moment this seed was planted in my mind and came up with nothing.  (Lets be real, I am not a licensed professional)  when I read about Complex PTSD and actually admitted to myself this was my problem it made me feel better. It motivated me to seek help because for once I knew there was something wrong and that it was not just me. 

Denying your pain is not a cure. Covering it up and trying to hide it is not going to help. I have dealt with this sickness for at least 15 years and to have a single drop of hope was refreshing.  ",ptsd

"My wife was admitted to the hospital due to ptsd and I'm really worried about her First, I wanted to use a throwaway but new accounts can't post, so I decided to use an old throwaway instead. I just don't want this linked to my main as there's identifying info on there.

My wife has always struggled with mental health issues but she'd been stable on meds and doing better for a while (around 3 years). Her and her psychiatrist decided to try to go down on her psych meds because she was doing better and she went downhill really fast.

She's been refusing to sleep because of nightmares, keeps having flashbacks and keeps talking about wanting to kill herself. We went to the ER after she told me she didn't feel safe and couldn't promise me that she wouldn't do anything while I was asleep. 

I was really hoping that the hospital would be able to help her but so far they just haven't done anything. She's been using the landline to call me and says she has been feeling awful and keeps having flashbacks and crying. She finally got to talk to a psychiatrist today who didn't even adjust her meds. After that she talked to a social worker, who wants to give her something to help her sleep (and thinks she's manic cause she's not sleeping). The social worker said that she should be able to go home in a day or two as long as she's sleeping through the night.

My wife says she doesn't think they're taking her suicidal thoughts seriously and she wants to come home. I'm scared because I don't think I can keep her safe at home but if the hospital won't help her, who will? I don't understand how they can discharge her if she's just as suicidal as when she came in. She says she still doesn't feel safe. I don't know how to help.

She has no one to talk to about how she's feeling and there isn't even group therapy (apparently the group manager is on vacation???). So she's just been sitting in her room and crying. Aren't they supposed to have people she can talk to?

I am just so worried about her and I don't know what to do.

"Technically diagnosed I‚Äôve always struggled with symptoms of ptsd without my awareness. Though in the past year or two I‚Äôve recovered some memories and realized I had a traumatic childhood, even beyond the fact that my parents were neglectful. I probably developed it around 1-2 years old as that was likely the height of my abuse, via family members no one should have trusted me around (thanks guys).

Been in CBT/EMDR and went through the DES-2 questionnaire. Scored a 31, which she said qualifies me as ptsd level dissociation. It‚Äôs weird to think I‚Äôve been dissociated for so long since it feels so so normal, but it makes sense since I have felt emotionally numb since I could ever remember. Wasn‚Äôt fully aware of that fact till after I started dating/trying to manage relationships. 

I guess I‚Äôm in therapy so that‚Äôs a step, but what now? I feel like I can‚Äôt work, even though I‚Äôm managing to take care of myself, but it‚Äôs been so difficult trying to get back into a flow of working and getting money for myself.

"Didn‚Äôt realize my child had PTSD and I feel like the worst parent ever ! TW Almost 3 years ago my daughter and I got into a really bad car accident. Luckily we were ok. She was 5 when this happened now almost 8 
We have talked about what happened before and she‚Äôs normally ok with it . But she does bring it up often . But she never seems really upset or triggered by it when she talks about 
But on Saturday we went to this sandwich place called Firehouse subs and for some unknown reason they sandwich place was playing videos over and over of what firemen do and how great they are but the video kept talking about accidents and fires and how in one crash 2 people died but that the person was so thankful for the firefighters who helped 
 It kept playing sirens over and over and at the same time my in-laws were talking about a crash they saw last week .

And out of no where my 7 year old starts screaming and saying she‚Äôs really scared and the sirens are scaring her and wanted me to make it stop :( she wouldn‚Äôt calm down. I was already getting triggered as well but didn‚Äôt want to make a scene 
I gave my daughter my headphones and let her watch bluey and she started to calm down .
When we got home she told me how scared the sounds made her feel and that she just remembers the accident and how scary it was . And she kept seeing the accident :( ! I feel TERRIBLE she had never brought up these feelings till now . 

I want to call her and see what they think but I also don‚Äôt want to make her talk about it if it will trigger her more . This is so confusing to me especially since she‚Äôs just a kid :( idk how to handle it 

I do remember when I would pick her up from school and if j was even a tiny bit late due to traffic she would be crying and telling me she thought I crashed again and died :( !

"Trying to come to terms with maybe losing my friends I got really triggered a month or so ago, and picked a big fight over email with some people in a long-time friend group. One of them basically told me she doesn't believe I have PTSD, that I am just blowing things up out of proportion in my head so I can revel in playing the victim. I accused them all of being enablers of the guy who retraumatized me and made my acute symptoms come back, after they had been mostly in remission for most of 20 years. I think I have known for a while that it wasn't working out trying to cling on to these friendships, but I haven't had the heart to just ghost them or walk away. I wound up kind of trauma-dumping on them in another email, as if that was going to convince them when they didn't believe me before. 

I was stuck in fight-or-flight mode, the worst it's been in a very long time, and wasn't thinking rationally, of course. I couldn't get out of that mode for like a week straight, and I got into a bunch of trouble at work - I was in such a fog that I spent a whole day entering data wrong, and had to go back the next day and redo most of it. I was in a meeting and completely blanked on the fact that I had a due-out from it, until the head of our whole organization emailed to ask why I hadn't done it.

The girl who accused me of making up the PTSD suggested we should talk, so we set up a time, and then she got sick and had to cancel (not just an excuse, because I knew our talk was not the only thing she canceled on), and never reached out to reschedule anything. I could have just left it, but instead I took the initiative and asked if she wanted to reschedule, and now we have plans to meet in a week. I also have plans to meet with someone else who was on the blowup email. 

I don't know, am I being an idiot to keep trying with these people? I don't want to get my hopes up that things can ever really be okay between us again after what was said, on both sides; and yet I keep getting my hopes up that something can be salvaged. Am I just grasping at straws? It just feels too cruel and cold to simply give up on them and cut them off or walk away, after all the history and nice times we've had together, and all the times they were kind to me and supportive in the past. And they are care enough to talk, at least, and isn't that not nothing? Even if what we have to say to each other is, Goodbye, at least we tried?

"Prolonged exposure - dissociation/no emotions?  Hello everyone!

I am currently going through a prolonged exposure treatment. I have multiple traumas, for instance several cases of sexual abuse/assault. Now, I am quite concerned. The first time I told my therapist about the trauma (the most severe case probably) in session, I had a lot of emotions, sadness and so on. It was really horrible to listen to the recording every day of the week after that, and I was a mess, really distressed and incredibly tired/worn out, in a way I didn't expect at all (even though everyone has told me it would be though) The second session when telling the story of the trauma, I felt so numb. I felt a lot of ""I don't want to do this""/anxiety, but no emotions. Then, during the second week when listening to the recording, I felt again completely worn out/sick from the stress. I started getting horrible, MUCH worse than usual, pain in my body from the stress. I also got very distracted when listening, thinking about other things and feeling very distressed about them but not about what I was listening to. Then the third session, again, I didn't feel anything except this ""I don't want to do this""-feeling plus intense muscle pain in my body. I felt like I was failing completely. Now, when listening to the recording, I didn't feel anything again. I'm really trying to get in touch with my emotions, but I don't feel anything, just a huge worsening in body pain, which I get distracted by, plus some other distracted thoughts. I even went back to the first recording, where I show a lot of emotions, to try to bring anything out. But I don't feel anything! Just the body pain, horrible muscle pain! I'm really worried I won't get any effect from the treatment. I also experience a lot of increased distress/some suicidal thoughts (that I didn't have before) because I feel like I will never get better and I'm a failure. Any thoughts?

"Anyone here have trauma related to an ""act of god"" type of incident? tw: details about powerlessness and death I experienced something so large scale and impersonal and it shook my foundation of how I see the world. 

It solidified in my mind that I am nothing more than a tiny ant, building an anthill that could be wiped out completely at any moment. You spend your whole life building goals, building relationships, working hard and chipping away at life day by day. 

At any moment, it can all be taken away in an instant by an impersonal force that is a million times stronger than you. Your death is guaranteed because you are so small compared to how large this outside force is. 

Its the feeling of complete powerlessness. This impersonal, large scale power can just end your life at any moment without warning. 

It truly makes you feel like a bug. 

I've also experienced abuse and other trauma but its a totally different feeling. Abuse is so personal and intimate. Large scale disasters or violence are so impersonal. I'm wondering if anyone relates. 

Ever since I experienced this, I cant kill bugs anymore. ",ptsd

"I collect stuffed animals as an adult because my parents threw all mine away as a child. I think I wrote like 5 full on essays about how I am feeling right now and I deleted all of them, but I thought maybe I should write something bittersweet instead.

I am an adult but a few years ago after being kicked out for a while and living with a relative I bought two stuffed animals, they were dragons. It ended up completely changing my life. They brought me so much comfort that I decided to buy more, and more, and more, now I have a collection worth 8-10k (no I did not spend this much don‚Äôt worry haha, I just buy a lot of vintage/second hand and get good deals). I guess it‚Äôs gotten a little out of hand since the l‚Äôve all essentially taken over my room but it makes me feel so happy and not alone.

I had a lot of stuffed animals as a kid that I loved, but my parents threw a lot away or sold them. It was heartbreaking because they did not do this to my sister‚Äôs just me, probably a punishment for whatever it was at the time, but I lost everything, even the ones that were extremely sentimental. They even managed to get rid of one of my baby blankets to hurt me.

So this was my way of taking that all back, I just grew this passion for buying stuffed animals, specifically dogs, and maybe it seemed weird to people but it makes me happy and despite living with my parents still (for now) it makes my room a safe space. My bf said my room is super comforting somehow, I guess that‚Äôs kinda what I was going for.

I was diagnosed with PTSD last month when I finally took the step to get therapy and work on a lot of things. I kinda already knew deep down, but hearing that it is an official diagnosis hit me pretty hard. I have just not been in a good space but maybe tomorrow I will organize my stuffed animals since being really depressed they are not organized and it really bothers me.

"Survivors Guilt So I'm struggling alot with survivors guilt.
I've cPTSD cause of many things, but one thing that recently been a lot more on my mind is a mistake I've made.
It was 10 years ago, I was 13 years old, as I've accidently klled someone.
I was drunk, my father was an alcoholic and so I grew up drinking, that evening I was drunk and stole a car and caused an accident. 
I've made it out alive but the other man in the car wasn't so lucky.
The thing is, I keep thinking about it, thinking I should've died in it, not him, that I'll never forgive myself for it and I'm so afraid of ever driving again.
I keep having these nightmares about it and where I just wake up sweating.
I never really got any punishment cause of it, though I was in the psych ward for a while after it.
But I feel like it's just not fair, why am I still alive after what I've done...
And how can I possible forgive myself for it...
I feel like I don't deserve my life and that I don't deserve the good things that are happening to me..

I remember it very vaguely but what I do remember feels very real to this day. Sometimes i think it was dream but the most important thing that I can remember was the actual feeling of us kissing and how much I hated it.
You don't really remember the actual physical feeling of things in your dreams the way I remember this. I remember years ago me and my older sister were having a conversation and she asked me if I had ever had my first kiss and I was like ""yeah you"" not really thinking much about it at the time as this was years after the incident but I was still really young. She just laughed about it and said it didn't happen and for years I never thought about it until recently. Now it just constantly pops up in my head and I wonder weather or not it really happened.

I don't necessarily think that this traumatized me but I do wonder if this did happen could it be apart of the reason as to why my mind is such a mess in my adult life? (I'm 20 now ) I also wonder if it is true then why did she do it?

"Dumped by therapist. (Male) Hello, not sure if this is the right forum (I rarely use Reddit, so please inform me if it is not and I will promptly delete it/also posted to others in case this isn‚Äôt the right place to put it) but my therapist dumped me. Also warning for child sexual abuse as well and animal abuse (nothing graphic, essentially a very broad rundown, I don‚Äôt know how to edit flairs or add multiple if that is possible so apologies for that).

I struggle with ‚Äúintrusive thoughts‚Äù and understanding the concept of what is and isn‚Äôt morally correct in societies viewpoint. When I was a small kid figuring this out myself with a long history of childhood abuse (sexual and verbal), I took it out on animals in a violent way (which I will not get into detail what I did because I do not think it is necessary nor appropriate - but to sum it up I was a very empathetic child to a certain degree before something clicked after an event and I just didn‚Äôt feel that way towards animals besides irritation and puzzlement), along with other rather disturbing things beyond my home life that happened to me or around me. Now as a young adult, I understand to a degree why it is considered wrong and I lay down rules for myself for the things I don‚Äôt necessarily understand to prevent acting on thoughts and urges to adhere to societal expectations and avoid any ramifications (besides a few incidents as a teenager) and would never harm an animal or person if I can help it.

However, I opened up and was honest with my therapist about my childhood (the first time I have been completely in-depth and honest about my childhood assaults and history with animals which is a breakthrough for me personally considering I‚Äôve had well over six therapists growing up and never went in depth about those things in my childhood) and she essentially said she didn‚Äôt want to work with me anymore, and heavily considered I check myself into an institution before I ‚Äúsnap‚Äù - which absolutely boggled my mind. From personal experience, wards never helped me and in fact made things worse. 

I do want therapy, but I feel like I cannot be completely transparent and honest with an individual without a recommendation like that. Therapy in the first place never really helped me with the advice they offered, but it was therapeutic enough in itself to just talk without being ‚Äúopenly judged.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be seeing any therapists anymore because honestly - I‚Äôve given up looking for one who can deal with cptsd and people with a history like mine. Not to mention the waitlist times for therapy is absolutely insane where I am and if you don‚Äôt click with one, then you have to wait even longer. Honestly, I feel abandoned by her and quite pissed at the situation considering I was trying to get help for the things inside my head only to be cast out like some stray mutt.

I just needed someplace to put this out into the open because I‚Äôm at a time where my mental health is getting horribly bad again and this really sent me over the edge because I was on my way there before I got the message she cancelled and didn‚Äôt want me as a client anymore, etc, etc. I do not know if I should continue looking for a therapist, or if it‚Äôs a complete lost cause? I don‚Äôt mind replies, advice or whatever if anybody has any - and if you took the time to read this all I appreciate it. Hope y‚Äôall have a good day/night. ",ptsd
"Is it likely that I have PTSD? I have diagnosed OCD. I have ADHD do because it's not an official diagnosis; however, my therapist gave me the questionnaire used by psychiatrists to see whether someone has it and I met the criteria because a lot of my answers were in the grey boxes. 

I used to work in a restaurant and the staff was mean to me because I was quiet and just said hi and bye. The thing is I didn't want to get fired, so I would never fight back. Then one day a girl kept harassing me and I just lost it. I started to fight back all the time.

I was having an argument with one of my coworkers before he was leaving and he put his hand in his pocket. When he did that, my eyes got teary and I got anxious because I had thoughts that he was going to take out a knife. I didn't think he was going to do that, I got thoughts of that happening during that moment and it made me scared. All he did was reach for a pen.

One day about three years before I worked in the restaurant, I was outside and a weird stranger came and started talking to me. He was ask him "" do you know me? "" Stuff like that. I wasn't replying to him. Then he took out a knife and told me to answer him. I got so scared. Then we went back to square one and I started answering the questions and he left.

"Muscle Jerks and Shaking Does anyone else get head shakes and jerks and involuntary muscle movements, in the arms and legs and head, when you're being triggered? 

And I've also been having this happen every single day since my trauma just before I go to sleep too.

Sometimes when there's about to be flashbacks I get these shakes and jerks instead also, and the focus somehow goes there instead, and the flashback passes without having to experience much of it, it's like a stopper or something.

Is this what's it's like when the trauma is ""stored in the body"" like they say?

When it's awful though it gets to the point of how they used to portray possessed people in old films, these muscle movements and shakes get slower and some get stuck for a while.

TLDR of my trauma was SA when I was 10. My dad just gave me childhood photos as he has been cleaning up the house.

"Finding out the circumstances of my father‚Äôs death brought on a whole new wave of trauma My mother and father had me at the ages of 23 and 25 respectively. They‚Äôd not been together long, and had split up before my mother found out she was pregnant with me. They got back together due to said pregnancy but split up again a couple months into my birth. I‚Äôd be between homes from then, spending half the week with my mother in her house and the other half with my father, who still lived with my grandparents. After a couple years my mother met my stepfather and moved in with him. When I started school, aged around 3, I‚Äôd only see my father at the weekend. He‚Äôd pick me up on Friday evening, and I‚Äôd go back to my mother on Sunday night. 

Every time he came over to pick me up or drop me home, I used to be filled with dread, as my mother and father would have a full blown argument every single week without fail. It was quite upsetting for me at the time and each would make a point to blame the other in front of me. I eventually got used to it, but looking back, I think this may have had a massive impact on my life.

When I was 5 years old, my father bought his first house, and the two of us would go there every weekend and spend the whole weekend together. One weekend he picked me up on Friday and I went back to my mother and stepfather on the Sunday. 

My mother woke me up Monday morning in tears and told me I wouldn‚Äôt be going to school that day because my father had died Sunday night. I‚Äôll never forget the sudden rush of numbness that overtook my body at that moment. I just couldn‚Äôt comprehend it. I‚Äôd only seen him no more than sixteen hours before, and now I was being told I‚Äôd never see him again. 

I didn‚Äôt cry at all. The feeling of sadness hadn‚Äôt really hit me whatsoever, it was more just the shock. I just couldn‚Äôt understand how he could just die like that. Being only 5 years old, my view of mortality was that only old people with grey hair and walking sticks die, not people who hadn‚Äôt even hit 30 years of age. My mother and I attended the funeral, I didn‚Äôt cry there either. Even though my mother and all my family on my father‚Äôs side were in floods of tears, I remained absolutely silent and completely numb. 

As I got older, I‚Äôd think about my father every day and would visit my grandparents every weekend instead of him, as I‚Äôd basically been doing anyway, he‚Äôd only had his new house for a few weeks before his death. I never cried about his death, and always avoided talking about it. In fact, it‚Äôs very very rare that I‚Äôll talk about it with anyone. At that age I didn‚Äôt want anyone to know and had no desire at all to discuss it with anyone. I‚Äôve maybe told a handful of friends since and those have been very recent. 

A few years ago, I was talking with my grandmother, and the topic of my father arose. She got emotional talking about it, and asked me if I knew how he passed away. At this point, it dawned on me that I never tried to draw any conclusions for why a 29 year old man in decent health would suddenly die. But it suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks, and I knew what she was about to say before she said it. He committed suicide that Sunday night. 

I felt such a horrible sense of anxiety when those words left her mouth and didn‚Äôt know how to respond. After she left, I was still processing the information but I didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I started to panic and felt physically ill. I went for a walk to try and calm myself down but I just found myself getting more and more worked up as I paced down the road. The feeling is so difficult to describe. 

Since that day, my father‚Äôs death has really had a devastating impact on me. I think about it constantly every day, and have done for the last 3-4 years, and despite having moments alone where I shed some tears over the thought, I‚Äôm still very closed off about it and try to avoid the topic the best I can. I feel like before finding out I‚Äôd managed to sort of get over his death, but since finding out that he took his own life, it‚Äôs brought everything back, only 100 times worse‚Ä¶",ptsd

It's really affecting our relationship and idk what to do. I'm on medication for depression and anxiety, but I can't afford to go to therapy at the moment, so I'm looking for some help in the meanwhile. How do I be a normal person with interests and feelings?",ptsd
"Seizure ptsd I had a seizure from pill addiction where i stopped and the seizure was from the withdrawal. Since then, i have not taken the pill and have a very healthy life, but I still get severe anxiety about having it again sometimes, especially after nights out drinking. It then becomes physical and my head starts spinning.

"It's not fair  It's just not fair. I did nothing wrong. I just wanted a boyfriend. I was 12. I was small and pathetic. I was a kid. He was 14 and he preyed on me like I was a rabbit. He did every evil thing a 14 year old probably could do to their boyfriend and get away with it. 

The ptsd started my downwards spiral. It literally broke me. I have FND now. I have daily seizures and muscle spasms and memory loss. Because some evil bastard wanted to hurt me. He admitted I was cute when I was scared. 

I just don't understand. I have no closure, and it's the season where ptsd is especially bad for me. I feel like it wasn't such a big deal. I know people who have been through worse. So why am I so messed up about it 8 years later?

"Dragging myself from the pit and getting real help! About 2 weeks ago my PTSD flared up worse than it's been since the trauma happened several years ago. I've been paralyzed by fear and haven't left my apartment. Terrified of everyone and everything. Couldn't keep good communication with my family and friends. The only contact I've really had has been my partner who lives states away.


I was going to lose my job due to performance and absence and just give up. I've been sober for 3 years and have never had cravings like I have lately. I literally was just hoping it would stop or I'd get bad enough to go to the hospital, either mental or rehab. I was too stuck in my head to even think there was another option.


My amazing partner helped me talk through it and find another way. I decided I'm not giving up. I got brave enough to talk to HR and get FMLA leave started and I'm moving in with my partner so I would be alone. I talk to my psychiatrist later today and I'm going to ask for some real PTSD treatment. I'm going to 12 step again (online, outside is still too scary - not to mention getting dressed and showered is almost an Olympian feat right now). 


Things are going to be okay! The momentum is building. I even got out of bed and cleaned up my home a bit for the first time in weeks. I still feel like burning trash and each hour is a toss up on if I'm curled in fetal position or just white knuckling the despair I'm feeling.

"I think I have trauma from my suicide attempt, and that it's making me depressed In late January 2024, I tried to kms, it was completely botched as far as I can remember, I have never talked about it to anyone in detail because I am so ashamed of it being so botched.
I think it left me traumatized (though I am too ashamed to use this term): I had flashes when drinking heavily (I then stopped drinking), I am almost completely unable to talk about suicide or my body shuts down and I start crying, before that it was a normal topic to me. Furthermore, I dissociate much more often, which lands me in trouble in various environments, and I have many spasms that are easily triggered, and I am ashamed of my behavior.

Adding to that, there is so much guilt, not from my sa specifically, but from the fact that I have relied on many means (medication, mental clinic, doctors) and still can't get my shit together, and that my ""absences"" and my shutdowns are seriously impacting my every day relationships. I should be able to function normally now but I can't!!!!

The impossibility to talk about suicide, or land in a mental health institution again (idk why though), basically the lack of any means to get help, associated with the guilt, makes me feel like I am trapped in a situation where no one can help me.
And that every single thing that doesn't go as planned is absolutely infuriating because it's taking the few energy that I have for something completely futile, yet if I don't do it then it's all over.

I have so much anger because for the first time in my life I don't want to die, but everything is telling me that I should.
I fear that depression is coming back, and that my every effort to combat the last one is completely irrelevant towards this one that is built upon my attempt.

"PSA reminder ""normal"" Just because something is labeled as ""normal"" or has been normalized in society, does NOT make it healthy. Normal does not mean good communication, healthy boundaries, and healthy perspective.

Therapy isn't there to make you ""normal"". It is there to help you have a functional and happy life. You dont have to be ""normal"" to be happy and functional.

Stop comparing things to what normal is as if its the end all be all. It used to be normal to chop off someones head in a guillotine. It used to be normal to abuse your wife and children mentally and physically. DO NOT LIVE YOUR LIFE FOR NORMAL.

"scared to go home  Due to financial struggles, me and my husband had to move in with my parents, and even though at the begining it was tolerable, after I decided to talk to my mother about the sexual abuse I had endured as a teen, she's become horrible. I had hoped she would show some support, but on top of being indifferent about it back when it was happening, she blamed me for it now, claming I must have wanted it. It was a couple of months ago that she blamed me to my face for it all, and it's increasingly difficult to look her in her face without feeling my blood boil. I have to concentrate on work and studies, but all I can think about is the empty gutteral feeling of not having a loving motherly figure. I have the support of my husband, but I know it breaks him apart as well. My mother fullfilled my deepest fear of someone close to me actually blaming me for the crimes commited against me, and i've never felt more scared to go home, but i have nowhere else to go. It's only been a couple of months that I came to terms with the fact that I was infact a child (15) when I was raped, my mother keeps on insisting, that I was a full grown adult. I never tried to blame her for what happened, it's not like she could keep a hormonal teenager indoors, but to claim that she had no responsibility in letting her 15 years old child be physically and sexually abused by another teenager seems simply absurd. Few of the break downs I've had in her presence have ended with her forcing me to take benzos, pulling a concerned face and whining about how hard it is to have an insane child, calling me a masochist for having flashbacks and other ptsd symptoms.

"How to break out of this mental prison? I want to share a very complex case with you‚Äîit‚Äôs a mental prison from which I am determined to escape. I‚Äôm working on a strategy for this and need help and support. I will share all the important facts that contributed to building this mental prison and describe the vicious cycle as it operates in my case.

I was severely abused from my early years. My mother would beat me for everything, blame me, and stripped me of all my rights. She imposed all responsibilities, duties, and obligations on me. Additionally, she would tell me that my actions were insignificant and that I could not achieve real things. Yet, she blamed me for not studying, constantly conveying that I was completely dependent on my parents, so I should study. However, I didn‚Äôt have the tools to study. She terrorized me, saying that if I did not study and wasted my time, I would end up in an embarrassing job. An important factor to consider is the daily force-feeding when I was little, every day for many years; she would beat me if I could not eat an adult portion of a meal. Because of this, my body rejected food, and I was eating only to survive. I became unhealthy and thin, and with all these problems, I also had no energy to study and concentrate. However, I tried to study but couldn‚Äôt; my head was hurting, and I didn‚Äôt have energy.

As a result, I fell into depression. I was depressed for many years at school. I did what I could; fortunately, with the remaining energy, my brain was able to learn pretty fast, at least at a sufficient level to pass exams, but that was the minimum. However, this situation instilled in me a strong fear of not being able to do anything real or important, so a bad future always seems imminent. I am terrorized and have a strong fear of the future all the time. I always feel I need to have complete control over things to feel safe or okay, but I am never relaxed; I am always anxious. Even now that I work, I feel this danger about the work, that it will not continue forever. I have strong fears that something will go wrong.

Also, whenever I imagine a good thing in the future, that I achieve something important, my brain blocks it violently. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but immediately when I start to imagine that I am getting out of this situation and building a good future, I have a kind of short-circuit feeling that violently blocks these positive thoughts and distracts me from those positive images I am building.

In a schematic way, this vicious cycle works as follows:

-	I have a goal (for example, to study or to get my job done).
-	I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything important, so I can‚Äôt study well or I can‚Äôt do a job well, no matter my efforts.
-	I lose motivation to do things because I feel I will not be able to do them anyway, and I feel depressed.
-	I feel dependent on someone else for resources (like I was dependent on my parents as a child, now maybe at work), and I am terrified that if I cannot do my job properly, I will be abandoned.
-	But I can‚Äôt do my job properly because I believe I can‚Äôt do important things no matter my efforts,
-	So, I feel afraid that I will lose a job or a source of resources.
-	Whenever I imagine a concrete plan that can work well and start to imagine a good future for me, my mind violently blocks my thoughts, which completely deconcentrates me from these positive thoughts, and I can‚Äôt get back to them for some reason.

I was able to solve the eating problem by concentrating on it as a priority, because without energy I could not do anything. But the rest of the problems remain to be solved. I have a clear picture of the major things happening in my mind but need to find a strategy to get out of it.

I tried to discuss this with different psychoanalysts; I‚Äôve changed more than 10 of them, but they could not make any progress, so I stopped searching and now I am trying to resolve it on my own. Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions to break out of this loop? What approach can I use?",ptsd
"How to deal with this? As a boy, I grew up with an extremely abusive mother. She would beat and verbally insult me daily for many years, right up until I was 13, when I blocked her hand as she tried to hit me. She was narcissistic, constantly belittling me while praising herself, and she placed all the blame on me as a child, even attributing her problems and responsibilities to me. Unconsciously, I perceived her as someone who had a lot of power and rights over me, even though consciously I always knew it was wrong. From around the age of 7 or 8, I started to understand that this abusive and unfair treatment was not normal, but I felt I had no rights, only duties and obligations, with absolutely no freedoms. Whenever I tried to speak up, run away, or take action, she would beat me again and again. I felt trapped and suffocated, which led to psychosomatic pains in my stomach due to fear and anxiety.

My father was always absent, working many hours, even on weekends, because my mother refused to get a job. So, unfortunately, she was always at home, and her extreme toxicity deeply damaged my mental health.

I have complex trauma in many different aspects. In this post, I want to talk about one of them:

For some reason, she created an image of my father as being almighty, almost god-like. I remember this from a very young age. She would always compare me to him, telling me he was bigger, much better looking at my age, and that he was perfect in school. These comparisons were daily, and I heavily internalized all these things. She would tell me I was little, and that my thoughts and actions were insignificant. So, I practically had this image of my father, but I didn't know him from my own experience, because we never played together even once; he was always busy and away for work.

Growing up, this led me to the wrong conclusion that all adults have all the rights, and I have none. Subconsciously, I always felt women were untouchable, and men were so strong that I could never match them; I would always remain small and insignificant. I know consciously it's not like this, but for some reason, it continues to badly influence my emotions. So, all older people than me have power, and I don‚Äôt, even though I am already an adult. So I feel inferior in every aspect with respect to older people in general.

This is crazy, but when I go out for a walk or just to go to a bar, I am always alert and feel danger, especially from men. I think I need to protect myself. I also feel I can‚Äôt trust women, so I practically have uncontrollable fear of both sexes. I often have psychosomatic pains in my stomach for the anxiety and fear. This is real hell in everyday life and in every aspect. I live in isolation, have very few friends for this reason, and feel depressed because of it. I'm struggling to find the motivation to move forward daily.

Do you have any resources or thoughts to share to solve this?",ptsd
"has anyone gotten EMDR for their PTSD and if so how effective was it for you? Hey there, I got diagnosed with cptsd a while ago, due to long term traumatic events in an abusive household as a child. The aggressor was removed when I was 10 as we than moved away a year later. From childhood on all the way into my adolescent I had no therapy whatsoever, later in life I kept getting more problems around work that was not brain stimulating doing the same thing for hours on ends, day in day out, that I was seeing flashbacks from the time more and more, that I had pushed away. A year therapy later I was diagnosed with cptsd and autism, before I moved to Germany being in love there. I do wanna move back, as it wasn't what I was expecting and prob get diagnosed for ADHD.

  
In my year therapy with my therapist she eventually asked me if I was willing to try out EMDR, she explained the treatment for me and how it should work. We tried it out and that for a couple times, yet it didn't have any good influence on me, and a friend of mine also did and it didn't have a good effect on her either. She stared inot it getting flashbacks too tough to handle for her, me I couldn't keep up with the lights. The idea is that you follow the lights while thinking of your trauma so that memories get rewritten or perhaps processed faster and less intense? That is the explanation I got from it. The thing is, I stared blankly ahead, and while she told me to go back to the time of trauma, it's like sitting in a cinema, watching your life go by in a couple scenes and you are just mentally not in the world. It did not work for me, but I am gonna ask you, reader, if you have PTSD or know someone who has and you or they had EMDR treatment, how did it go and did it work?",ptsd

"My Husband and In Laws Don't Understand and it Hurts I ended up diagnosed with PTSD after my two dogs (German Shepherd and a Shepherd mix) got into a really bad fight.

Our older dog ended up going downhill healthwise and got put to sleep before our younger dog came home so I didn't have to worry about them getting into a fight but that only helped my fears inside the house, not outside. I made it clear to my husband that I was not capable of training this dog and that he needed to be able to do it without me. He agreed to that.

I don't trust our dog and I don't want to be around him when there are other dogs around. My panic attacks are unbearable and that level of discomfort doesn't go away unless I remove myself from it. I've tried exposure therapy but with my bad luck, I ended up witnessing 2 more dog fights and it made my anxiety worse so I stopped doing it. Nowadays is not as bad as it was in the first few months, as I dont have night terrors or startle reactions to inane, unrelated things. But a year later, I still can't face being around my dog with other dogs. It's still too hard.

My husband and his family pressure me constantly to bring our dog to his parents house when we stop in or attend holiday dinners. His parents have 2 large dogs. I told my husband very clearly, either I go or the dog goes, not both. My husband will still try to bring the dog with us and makes me feel stupid for saying I can't handle that. He will even sometimes ask me why as if I haven't cried while telling him how much I hate that I can't control how my mind and body reacts and how ashamed and embarrassed I am of it. I've told him I've felt suicidal over it, especially in the beginning. Every time we visit his parents without the dogs, his mom asks ""wheres the dog?"" and will talk about how much my brother in law misses him and wants to see him. I thought for a long time that she just didn't know why he doesn't come when I'm there. I found out today that she's well aware of my issues so it feels like shes poking at it on purpose. Which feels so cruel and hurtful. It's a small thing but it really hurts me.

It's so hard to explain to people who have never had to deal with this themselves that the worst part of all of this is the shame. They don't need to make me feel stupid cause I already do. They don't need to make me feel bad cause I'm already riddled with guilt. The lack of understanding makes me feel like I'm defective and alone. All I want is support and I'm made to feel ridiculous, like I need to just get over it already cause it's annoying. I've told my husband he should feel very lucky that he doesn't understand.

Is there anything I can do to help them understand or do I have to just be the bigger person and get a better handle on my feelings towards these ignorant remarks?",ptsd
"Forgetting parts of an almost wreck I was driving home late last night, around 12:30, and almost got into a wreck. I was swerving between the barrier and an 18-wheeler on the highway.

"I have some trauma from bullying So I was in the cross country team all throughout high school and my freshman and sophomore year i was going through a pretty emotional time because of hormones i guess. But anyways I would look really sad and emo and people would call me a school shooter because of that. 

The only good thing in my life at the point was I got good at running. After the end of the cross country season I was really trying to fit in so I was hanging out with my brother a lot trying to talk to his friends, which I really shouldn‚Äôt have done. I went to a party that was for seniors and everyone left me alone except for a guy on the team who made fun of me occasionally but it wasn‚Äôt bad until I interacted with him here, he was pretty much picking on me and at one point he starting pinching me and I just slapped his hand away. He was like ‚Äúoh ok ok, Corey hold my beer‚Äù and then he bodyslammed me. There was literally nothing I could do, I was much weaker than he was and I would‚Äôve just injured myself more. After that another point in the party I walked past him and then he shoved me and laughed. 

I had to leave after that. When summer practice started and I was talking to my friends getting all excited because I was excited for the season he was behind me with his click and was saying ‚Äúlook at this cringe kid, I actually through him on the ground at a party, it was easy.‚Äù And then he shoved me. I decided to shove him back but it was barely anything, because I was weaker than he was. 

Another point at another practice he was running behind me and then he started making fun of me some more making fun of my physique. 

There a lot more to this but this is the run up and the main things that make me angry every now and then. This was 5 years ago now and I still cannot get over it. From what I‚Äôve heard so far the guy failed out of college and now works in insurance. I get so uncomfortable when I think of this I can‚Äôt focus on other things. 

I never told a teacher or anyone superior about this because of the stigma of being a snitch or pussy. Looking back on it I feel like I should‚Äôve. It hurts me knowing I never got justice and so I look back constantly at how I could‚Äôve handled things differently. I‚Äôm now much stronger than I was (I can bench about 210) and often think about getting payback but obviously I can‚Äôt risk getting charged given I‚Äôm actually doing good in college now. ",ptsd
"I have to get a pap smear and it‚Äôs kinda bitter sweet  Cw- sexual trauma and stuff 

So, I‚Äôm a trans man, and about to get a hysterectomy. Legally in my state the only requirement to get one is to be 21 

However my insurance has informed my doctor that in order for them to approve of it they require a vaginal exam for a Pap smear, as well as an ultrasound. 

I‚Äôm so happy to be getting a hysterectomy soon, but dysphoria and ptsd has made the process a bit hellish. 

In order to get something that will improve my life and make me happier I have to go through something that could be kinda traumatic. 

I‚Äôve been prescribed a Xanax to take beforehand though, and I am hopeful. 

This situation has reminded me how much my ptsd symptoms have improved. Just a few years ago it wouldn‚Äôt matter how much Xanax you gave me, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do it. Now though I imagine I‚Äôll be okay. It won‚Äôt be fun but I can get through it. 

My mom will be with me too holding my hand which will definitely help.

"Started sleep walking the last year of my toxic job and I realized today I still do     I‚Äôve never posted anywhere for any advice. I can usually figure things out put this one. I‚Äôm literally not in control of the symptom and not aware when it‚Äôs happening so I‚Äôm at a loss. I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with PTSD, but I had a hard last year at my previous job. I started hearing air sirens, and loud sounds in my head when I‚Äôd ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and it was like inception. I‚Äôd start getting ready and it would reset and at first I believed it was all just dreams until things in my room or moves and I was at various states of getting ready. Today I was going to start a new job for the first time in almost a year. I‚Äôve used alarms previously sometimes I do sleep through them, but nothing is moved. I have not had any sleepwalking instances during that time but this morning although the job didn‚Äôt start for fairly late in the day I woke up after that thought wow I missed the loudest alarm clock I could find.!??? And then unfortunately I saw things moved in my room. I had started to get ready. There were things thrown across my bathroom floor. I tried to use paint as part of my make up. I have no knowledge of any of it. I have never been a sleepwalker and never happened to me until my previous job. And I thought it would go away. I thought it had gone away. It doesn‚Äôt help that my biggest fear that I‚Äôve had in life for many years is doing things I don‚Äôt remember. I also obviously need a job and money. All of the doctors offices in my area a few months ago were booked out nine months. Maybe someone has an idea for online therapy. I honestly have no idea what a treatment for this would even be. 
  I hate that I am a person that really loves values and needs control and yet I‚Äôm having some moments that I am not even aware of.  I guess I also just need to hear from someone that might be going through this or has gone through it because I have never heard of this happening. At least no one told me it‚Äôs happened to them. Sorry if spelling is weird I used to talk to text and it won‚Äôt let me pull the cursor to the top and I‚Äôm sorry if this is the wrong place to put this. PTSD has never previously been a concern nor has sleepwalking. I was slightly concerned about those things with my previous job, but I didn‚Äôt take it too seriously and I thought once I got out of the situation, everything would be fine. I will probably look up before bed meditations that might help. Or a certain sounds, I can set as my alarm that could mitigate this. I don‚Äôt want to have to ask someone to make sure I‚Äôm awake but I guess if it comes down to that. Has anyone else had this issue? Has anyone gotten PTSD from a job? Had inception dreams where you keep waking up waking up waking up only to discover it‚Äôs hours later and you‚Äôre standing in front of the bathroom mirror thinking you‚Äôre getting ready? I don‚Äôt know any of it. It‚Äôs scary for me. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve never imagined as a possibility. For myself or even a thing that could exist.",ptsd
"Had another nightmare. I usually don't get them. This one was about bullying My last nightmare was about my parents fighting and I felt scared but I process it better because I love my parents. Today's nightmare was about getting called stupid. In highschool I got bullied and called stupid even tho I wasn't ironically which led to my ptsd. I dreamt I was in a classroom and everyone was ganging up on me again. My only response I could think of is ""im gonna kill myself"" so i ran out the classroom and I still got made fun of. I woke up angry and hot. Forgiving my parents is easy because I love them but I don't forgive people from highschool. Fuck them. They probably don't even remember yet it still affects me to this day.

"I'm having some thoughts that I should not be having Please delete if this isn't allowed. I'm really sorry for being on here as much as I am, I'm not trying to make myself the main character, I promise!

Tonight is one of those (increasingly frequent) times when I'm convinced that I am definitely going to lose this Me vs Post-Traumatic Stress fight. I feel like I'm just dragging it on but that I can't possibly win and that there is only one outcome. I've been having thoughts of suicide a lot in the past several months and even though I don't think I'm brave enough to do anything to myself (yet), I find myself hoping that someone will do it for me. I feel like it'll be easier on everyone who knows me if it's an accident.

My mom had witnessed me being triggered last night and even though I thought I'd played the role of recovering quickly fairly well, clearly I hadn't because she'd spent all of today talking about how I'm ""acting like something horrible has happened to me,"" how I'm an embarrassment to her, how difficult it is to have a daughter like me, etc. I don't trust her and I don't even want her to know. If I was a good enough actress to mask every symptom perfectly, I would have gladly done it.

"My trauma is ruining my life but I still have so many doubts Hey all, general TW for mentions of gun violence

I witnessed a shooting last year, and I'm starting to think I may have developed PTSD. My best friend and my partner both feel that I might have, at the very least that the shooting has deeply affected me. I'm starting to see where they're coming from, but I just can't bring myself to accept that the shooting could have affected me like that. 

My biggest thing is that I saw it, and it happened maybe 10 feet away from me, but I didn't get hurt. I can't accept being so shaken up when I'm not even the one that got hurt, I was lucky enough to get away and call 911. 

I know my parents put a lot of doubt and minimization in me when it happened. They're very manipulative, abusive, and their favorite thing to do is to downplay the severity of any bad situation. I know good and well that they're like this and always have been, but their judgements still ring true in my head. I was still living with them at the time, and I came home super rattled, it took me a good 20 minutes to spit out what happened to them. My mom told me how sneaky and secretive I was for not immediately telling them about it (as is her way), then my parents went on to tell me that I should've expected it going to that shady bar at that time of night, that I'm just lucky that I got away without being hurt, that I don't need to be so rattled because it wasn't me who got beaten and shot. 

And I know that isn't exactly healthy or realistic judgement and behavior from them, but I think it set into place my doubt. I thought I was fine at first except for my reaction to noises. For the first few months since it happened (and still to this day), loud and sudden noises startled me a lot. I worked in a kitchen, and I vividly remember one day someone dropped several metal sheet pans and I jumped so high and felt the sound through my entire being. I just had to continue on with work as normal. I eventually quit because I couldn't handle the stress of the kitchen, it wreaked havoc on my anxiety (amongst other things). 

Now, I feel borderline agoraphobic. I always think someone in public is going to snap out, so I rarely leave our house. I always think I hear people in our yard yelling, about to break into our house. I even get it in my head that my partner and his family are angry with me and will start an argument with me or worse.

I'm so tired. I just can't deal with this anymore. I can't live with constant fear that seeps deep into every fiber of my being anymore. I'm just so tired, and broken, and sometimes I feel like I'm about to break.

"My husband who has CPTSD is mad at me. Without getting into a ton of details or potential triggers, my husband (at the title says) has CPTSD. He had a mental breakdown about 3.5-4 weeks ago and went to the hospital because I had to call 911. The police said they were chalking everything up to a mental health crisis and he wasn't being charged with anything and took him to hospital. He got on new meds, came home after about 6 days in hospital and things seemed better.

Then we got a letter in the mail about a court date because apparently he is being charged with something. I tried to get time off work but couldn't due to short notice to go to court with him and he got a public defender and plead not guilty at advice. They put into place a protection order (not against me, I'm allowed to see him/talk to him/etc.) though so he's not allowed within 1000 feet of our residence among other things and set a trial date for the end of the month. He was escorted to the house to grab a bag and then left.

I spent that entire afternoon and evening trying to figure things out so he didn't wind up just on the streets and with some help from family we managed to get him a hotel room for a week, so that was resolved. I immediately next day filed for the protection order to be terminated. That won't go to the judge till Thursday. 

We only have one vehicle so we've been doing this thing where I park the car when he needs to use it at my work, he comes and gets it later then leaves it back at my work so I can get it. But yesterday he accidentally left a bottle of his meds in the car. I told him I was going after work to play bingo with some friends and he asked me to drop it off when I was done at bingo. I said no problem, went on my merry way to go play bingo.

I didn't know, because I've never gone, that one game of bingo is actually like 15 games of bingo and takes like 3 hours. He texted me part way through and I guess the cell phone signal was blocked or something and I didn't get the text until I went outside to have a smoke after the game. He was upset that I hadn't gotten the meds to him fast enough and that I was still there. I apologized because I didn't know it was going to be so long either.

He called me and started yelling that I didn't ask him if he wanted to go to bingo with me, that I'm not thinking about him, that this might be the last time we can see each other and do anything together before he goes to prison. I told him that going to prison is not necessarily a set in stone thing that is going to happen and that he needs to try to stay positive because getting stuck in his head isn't helping anything.

We eventually got off the phone and I drove his meds to him at the hotel. He took the bottle and then told me ""you can go back to thinking about other things now"" and went back into the hotel before I could respond. I tried to call him and he sent me to voicemail. I sent him a text that said ""Really don't know what you think I've been thinking about but I probably haven't"" and he's left me on read since last night. 

This while thing has been a very stressful time for both of us and I'm trying to be as supportive as I can be. I apologized on the phone for not inviting him to go to bingo and explained that I thought he wouldn't want to go because he's very introverted and he wouldn't have known anyone else there but me and he'd already been up since 6am and had gone to play paintball and seemed tired when I saw him to get the car back. I should have asked him and I said that, but I can't change what happened.",ptsd

I have severe lacerations on my neck and stomach from the seatbelt and can barley move, I had to call off work for the next week.

"Medication and coping with anniversaries  21F, suffer with severe PTSD as a result of childhood and teenage experiences, as well as a >!sexual trauma I faced at 18.!<  

Sleep is my biggest issue, has been since I was 12 years old. Leaving the house just behind it. Nightmares come and go, as do flashbacks and can be chronic at times. I live in a very small area at the top of Scotland so bumping in to people who may trigger me is a huge possibility every time I leave the house and leads me to isolate myself quite a lot. I have recently started taking 150mg Pregabalin morning and night, which has helped slightly and I am due to increase that to 300mg x 2 soon. 

I would be keen to hear experiences from anyone else on PG should there be anyone here, I cannot and have never taken SSRI‚Äôs or SNRI‚Äôs due to previous manic episodes, diazepam does nothing for me and a month on propranolol made me feel worse. 

Since the event at 18 (almost 4 years ago) I have been a heavy alcohol and drug addict, I have been to rehab twice for 2 weeks and then 3.5 months respectively and am in therapy but having to live in a place where there is a bad memory or the potential to run in to someone who triggers me everywhere I go means neither of these have been very beneficial and getting a move has proved to be quite difficult also. I have defeated a trauma bond with one of my abusers but I still don‚Äôt know how my brain and body would react if I was to bump in to them. I am lucky to have a very strong support network around me but there is only so much they can do and I don‚Äôt think any amount of therapy will ever make me feel safe here but I am working hard on getting out of here and in the meantime hoping some medication will make things easier. I have felt slightly better in the last few weeks since taking PG and being clean and sober. 

I am desperate to get my life back and build a routine such as exercising daily and eating well, doing things I used to enjoy and just looking after myself properly before December, my birthday and Christmas come, as these are the hardest times of the year for me and should I manage that should be a protective factor and I would hopefully have a drive to keep going when things get tough.

My work stuff got shuffled around, and long story short, I have a shift once a week one street over from the house of the teacher who (maybe???) was grooming me.

"I fought through my anxiety and sent a text to an old friend that knew me when things were the worst Last i heard he had moved far away from the city where we met. I thought i was safe to maybe have a friend again. But tonight he sends me a selfie with one of my rapists; they go out of their way to hang out now and then.

How wonderful, i'm so glad he still has friends. What the fuck is the point. I'm getting drunk.",ptsd
"feel like i'm out of treatment options Will preface that I am safe, i'm writing this from my bed at a crisis stabilization unit (similar to inpatient but voluntary and nothing is nailed down).

I don't want to die and I don't want to hurt myself, this shit just suuucks and i'm in unbearable pain all the time.

I've been through so many tragic and traumatic events I lose track of them. (Laundry list of dead friends, assaults, abusive authority figures, growing up trans in the south to my own detriment, got expelled from a christian school freshman year bc i got outed) Both my therapist and a friend of mine in his 60s have told me something to the effect of ""you've experienced more loss at 23 than most people do in a lifetime.""

In the last 2 months my symptoms have escalated considerably. My partner and I moved to a new house and within 24 hours of the last box coming through the door I started having these crying fits that last hours and hours and hours. This escalated for a bit so i started seeing my therapist 2x a week. Got an appt with a psych. She put me on some meds which I started this week. I've previously struck out with several other attempts at medication so we're down to the weird shit (memantine bc I have really bad OCD symptoms as well, the psych at CCS also gave me a script for luvox but it's not been filled yet)

2 weeks ago I took a leave of absence from work to go to PHP, in which we spent probably 40% of the time being shown TEDx talks and therapy in a nutshell on youtube (which i was miffed about but wtf ever, everyone's understaffed, i just want to heal) 

My symptoms have only escalated over the last few weeks. My usual regulation techniques (hot showers/stretching/distraction/sinewave breathing) are working less and less. Others that have been prescribed to me like mindfulness meditation and cold water on my face EFT tapping (FUCK that shit btw) tend to set me off instead of helping. I can't do the work to try and unpack my trauma anymore because so much as thinking about it sends me into a full-force spiral I can't get out of. 

I've been having ""total-recall"" flashbacks. Whereas usually flashbacks feel like i'm watching it on a movie screen, recently i'm having full cross-modal attacks where i can see/feel/hear/smell everything. Suddenly i'm right back in that scary place.

I have crying spells that last hours until I pass out, and that seem unavoidable no matter how much sinewave breathing or preventative measures I take. Recently my clonazepam PRN has stopped helping these episodes whereas previously it was my nuclear option.

Late this week I had an episode during PHP and my case manager recommended me to a crisis stabilization ward, where i am now. Most of the folks here are addicts or housing insecure so the groups are focused around that, which is fine, they need help too, it's simply not what I need. All i'm really getting rn is round the clock observation and a nurse making sure i take my meds.

I had the worst of these episodes today, I felt it coming on from a mile away, and had the nurse give me a full .5 tab of my klonopin preemptively (usually i take .25)

I sat by a window with a nice view, put on calming music, held myself while doing my sinewave breathing, and yet over the course of about an hour it just kept welling and welling until I started sobbing and i couldn't stop. 

I probably cried for another 90m before I was finally able to get the attention of the nurse, gave me another .5 of klonopin and hydroxyzine which KO'd me for a few hours. Now that i'm back awake i feel it welling up again so i took another .25 and am gonna try and go to bed early. Somewhere in there I started having uncontrollable tremors which is a ‚ú®brand new symptom‚ú® i've not experienced till today.

I've been in therapy for a decade, ever since i got expelled from christian school. I've done CBT, DBT, IFS/Parts, ACT, TIPP skills, I've spent a lot of time unpacking my shit, and for a while felt like I was actually making progress. I finished college, had a period of food/housing insecurity but landed a good job and just bought a condo with my life-partner. There was a shining minute back in like April when I could start to look at the trauma and be curious about it, and it didn't feel so big. I don't know why i've regressed so much so fast. 

It's been about a year now since the food insecurity stopped being a stressor, and trying to look at my life from an objective lense i'm the safest i've ever been. I have a loving partner, a house we own (thank you govt grant programs), and a relatively cushy job where I do fulfilling work. I have much much more than many of my friends can say.

Despite all this, i'm still in hell. I can't therapy skills my way out of these episodes no matter how hard I try. My hypervigilance is getting worse, my intrusive thoughts are getting worse, I'd been having these sobbing spells 2-3 times a week, since Thursday it's been daily.

The pain of everything that's happened is simply too much to bear. I really really really DON'T want to die. I want to grow old with my partner, I want things to get better, I want to believe that I'll overcome my trauma, but the pain is too much to bear and i'm rapidly exhausting my treatment options. 

I don't know where to go from here, I feel like my clinicians unilaterally don't know what to do with me, and i'm just scared and deeply hopeless about my treatment outcomes.

Has anyone else dealt with this sort of severity? Any tips on simply getting myself back on the horse? I'm on FMLA leave rn, but I need to go back to work soon so that I can keep my job, keep getting a paycheck, keep paying the bills and continue building my material/financial safety net so that I stop being so scared of slipping into food/housing insecurity again.

i want to keep going i just don't see any path forward. 

I feel like perfect-world i'd benefit from an inpatient residential with some kind of work-release to go to the office during the day (can't do my job remote unf). I think keeping myself busy has the potential to be helpful but I need round the clock support rn that I can't realistically ask of my partner or family. It doesn't seem like such a program exists though from what I can tell.",ptsd
"Traumatic breakup, only me to blame‚Ä¶ So I (20F) dated my ex (22M) on and off for around two years and three months ago was when it finally had ended. Looking back now I see that he never really loved me and am having to deal with all the things I let slide, he didn‚Äôt want make it official for the first 6 months because what he told me after ‚ÄúI thought I could find better‚Äù. He was unemployed for two years, mom did everything for him, told me he would ‚Äúruin me psychologically for other guys‚Äù, broke up with me and slept with someone else then came back said he love me and it was a mistake (and I let himüòñ) & wouldn‚Äôt always follow consent etc. After we broke up we were still seeing each other but he didn‚Äôt want to make it official again, but got mad if I saw other guys.

The final straw was him drunk driving and crashing a rental car abroad where we both nearly died. After, because I put down my card for the rental car (he paid the same for the hotel so it was 50/50) 5800$ came out of my account and I was forced into overdraft, mentioning this was also my late mum‚Äôs pension money. He said he would pay me back but his parents only sent half.

A couple weeks later he randomly called me said he wanted to be the ‚Äúsingle bachelor‚Äù life and we haven‚Äôt seen each other in person since. I asked for my money back but he said I should pay for his crash as it was my idea to go abroad then was ghosted for a month & blocked, until last week he called me and told me he really loved me and I was the one to ghost him? And that he‚Äôd moved to the other side of the world with his family a week after we split. I said I didn‚Äôt care and just wanted my money back (as I‚Äôm struggling financially right not) but he ghosted me again. Just to add his family is very rich.

Looking back at all this I only have myself to blame because why did I stay? Why did I let myself get treated like utter trash & put him on a pedestal? How can I trust anyone again if someone I was that close to & with almost everyday could treat me like that? Dating guys now would just feel like an insult to myself.

"On the fence about whether I should tell a family member about the crimes of another family member (trigger warning SA) Hello friends in healing!  I'm  about to visit a cousin I haven't seen in 7 years this week. About 2 years ago I found out another cousin on the same side of the family is a pedophile. It's despicable  revolting, and heartbreaking what he has done. He barely served any time in prison because the victim wouldn't testify. He's supposedly a Christian man now, and his mother lives with him because his wife left him. His mom is sort of watching him, but she may have been led to believe his crime wasn't as severe as it was. Everyone in my immediate family knows. His (pedo) little sister knows and won't talk to him ever again. She just totally cut ties. 

The hard part is there are several people in my family who have been victim to child molesters, including myself, my brother, and my mother, and a few others. I heard a rumor when I was kid that this cousin I'm about to visit also was a victim to a neighborhood creep. My opinions in the past were like there's no use for pedos in society. They should have to do slave labour, or sent to  Chinese prison camp where they do much worse. Now, it's complicated. 

My brother was so shocked and hurt by this very close relative doing the exact thing that has hurt my brother and changed his life in sad ways, BUT he said he ""doesn't want the guy to kill himself. He's basically like my brother.""

Anyway, I guess I'll call my brother about it  and see his opinion. I just also wanted to hear people's opinions here. I know we've all been through some kind of hell. I'm sure this crowd understands mixed emotions.

There's tylenol on the counter. 10 pills and I'm gone. There's knifes in the kitchen. One slice and in gone. Maybe I'll jump into the river by my house like the guy did last week. Maybe I'll starve myself to death so I last a little longer and get skinny in the process.

I don't wanna hear "" youre so young you have so much to look forward too "" when I've been waiting for things to get better ever since I was fucking 8 years old. Almost ten years of waiting and it seems like life is just throwing everything it can at me. I can't belive in a higher power no matter how hard I try. Because if someone or something was up there why would they give me all these horrible battles but let me stay so pained and suffering on earth. I can't handle every single week something horrible happening to me. I'm not even joking. I cannot go a week without finding out some terrible news or losing people in the worst ways or something bad happening to someone close to me or even just me in general.

"Prefrontal Cortex at 25- does this make trauma before worse? Hey guys,

Hope you can help me out. A friend was talking about how when you turn 25 or around the time your pre frontal cortex develops it can make trauma experienced and unprocessed a lot worse? Is this true? Like you can experience all the signs of ptsd but at that point they then can become unbearable?? and then you really start things like unhealthy attachments, choosing a familiar chaos over unfamiliar stability- maybe in relationships etc. Something about the disorder gettting a whole lot worse - maybe something to do with you now can see the past traumas were actually really fucked up but still have emotions from childhood? So like the adult part knows but that makes the child part feel horrific? Or maybe that extra brain spurt makes the amygdala grow?

I have experienced something similiar like around that time thats when things started becoming really really bad i dont know if coincidental but thats when drinking and drug use got really out of control, I broke up with a nice long term boyfriend and then went out with a narcissistic abuser

I dont know I could be getting the phrasing wrong- can someone please help me understand?

"Any tips on staying asleep? My therapist explained the connections between me being a night owl my entire life and childhood trauma. Night owls are not real. Humans don't function that way naturally. I've always just thought it was a preference. 

I work night shift, I've always stayed up late and slept during the day. My mom hated it. Going to bed at 4 or 5am but still waking up around 11am. I keep my night shift schedule on my days off.

I'm fine with this being my life and being more comfortable at night time. It has its benefits. Less people to be annoying, no management at work, tends to be more relaxed and calm. I wouldn't be asleep if someone were to break in, etc. 

The issue I struggle with is being hyper aware of movements in my room. My boyfriend wakes up to go to the bathroom and im up. Comes back and im up. My cat gets in bed to sleep with me, I subconsciously can't move all night in fear of laying on him. He moves or stretches, I wake up. 

This is getting old. I work 12.5 hour shifts and I woke up at 1pm today due to my boyfriend using the bathroom and couldn't get back to sleep.

I have been falling asleep at work with my head on a table during slow times since I know my phones will wake me up easily. 

I take zoloft daily, Buspar twice a day, I have trazadone as well for sleep. I'm just tired of the hyperawareness. I don't want to wake up any time he gets out of bed.

It‚Äôs been almost 10 years since I graduated and also roughly 10 years since my abuse stopped. I tried to pursue higher education but struggled with that also. Idk if it‚Äôs my PTSD, or the godawful work culture of my state (probably both), but most jobs I haven‚Äôt kept for more than 2 years.

"DAE with childhood trauma get lowkey triggered by kids / teens who are the age you were when it happened? OK so I went for a walk today, which is already a good achievement in itself, since I still live where I was for the majority of the 9 years of Initial Trauma & the 4(?) years of Follow Up Trauma, and going out is hard because no matter where I go, anywhere within walking distance involves either: locations I was traumatised in, locations I heavily associate with the trauma, or routes which lead to / go past those locations. So going out for a walk (for an hour!) is a good thing.


But while I was out, I saw 2 kids on bikes passing by (they were maybe 6) further up ahead who were walking their dog (they looked maybe 8-10), 2 kids out on a run / jog together (they looked 11 - 14), 2 kids passing by with their football (they looked 8-10) and 2 kids decorating their garden for Halloween (they were maybe 4). Other than the last 2, each time I saw the kids it was mildly triggering, and I kept expecting to see someone I knew / run into someone I knew as a child. But I also felt the anxiety / dread creeping up each time, because it used to be that if I saw a kid in that area, it was someone I knew due to the fact we were in the Trauma Location together & they were either also bring traumatised or they were in the same location but weren't developing Trauma/ weren't being abused there like I was. 

So even though I'm 25, even though I know for a fact I don't know anyone in those areas anymore, even though those kids have nothing to do with my Trauma... I still felt it creeping up on me.

"Do People Just Not Get It? October is a busy month for me, and it just gets busier until November hits essentially (for like, a week and a half, honestly), and I am going through a lot right now.

My main stressor is my lack of sleep while on campus. I am in year 2 of 2 for my masters degree. Last March, a fire alarm went off at 2 am while I was asleep; when they go off when I'm asleep, my brain thinks it's a nightmare so I have these super shoer nightmares about burning in the building or something.....after which I open my eyes to the fire alarm actually going off and I gtf out of there. Unfortunately, I have not been able to sleep on campus since.

I thought I would be better after the summer, but no. I have tried explaining this to my parents, and their first reaction is to *consider pulling me out of school* before realizing that I can't really do that because of my scholarship. I love my parents; simultaneously, I don't feel that they take this seriously, they didn't teach me drive so I can't commute, and they are not willing to help pay for therapy. 

I honestly don't know what to do; I think this lack of sleep thing is starting to affect my life, including productivity, energy levels, and my health...I take my health very seriously and do not need this.

Am I the only one who thinks they're alone in this?",ptsd
"My subconscious mind refuses to believe that the violence and assault on us has ended and that we live in peace now. I am really tired because I wasted 10 years of my life with the hypervigilance caused by the assaults that happened to me and the violence. 

But now my life is very, very full of peace and security, but unfortunately my subconscious mind refuses to believe that, even though I always try to convince it of that. 

I just want to experience the feeling of living in peace and tranquility because I miss these moments. But I still believe that I will succeed one day. 

What if there really is a way for me to convince my subconscious that the danger is over? But what is the way and how can I find it? 

I am very afraid to live the rest of my life like this because it is very tiring and I have more than 20 symptoms of my illness due to anxiety and psychological fear 

Life is not really fair because the victim continues to live in pain even though he is a peaceful person and he is the one who was hurt and does not deserve chronic mental illness that chase him forever /:

And my health has been in rapid decline as well. I'm a stay at home mom and homeschool my 6yo daughter. For some reason my number one trigger seems to be my daughter getting sick.

"Therapist validated previous PTSD diagnosis  I was diagnosed with PTSD several years ago and my previous therapists wouldn‚Äôt touch the subject. 

I was doing EMDR yesterday and I shared that I was previously diagnosed with my therapist, but that not much work had been done to address the PTSD. The therapist/psychiatrist (he was both) who diagnosed me just prescribed me medication but we didn‚Äôt do any therapy work with the trauma. 

I was expecting my current therapist to say I was misdiagnosed, but he said ‚ÄúI do think you show many signs of PTSD. It takes a while to land on a diagnosis and I didn‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions too quickly.‚Äù We ran out of time to discuss, but he said we‚Äôd talk about it in our next session. 

I don‚Äôt know, it was really validating to hear my therapist say he felt similarly. I feel like I‚Äôve tried so hard to convince previous therapists that I have PTSD, but I also didn‚Äôt want to make it seem like I was trying to self-diagnose. They always tell me it‚Äôs just anxiety and depression, but I‚Äôve always felt like there was something else. 

I kind of gave up on the idea that I might have it. This gives me hope that now we can treat it adequately.

"I Need Advice, Anything Helps. Hey, so I have PTSD related to grief, loss, death etc all things in that realm. Because a pet situation I experienced. That's about all the information I'll give on that.. But essentially, I have 5 cats and they're basically my kids. They're my family. I haven't ever been away from them for more than 24 hours in their entire lives, and it's obviously been years. I'm very protective of them, we have our little routines, I keep them safe.. But I'm going abroad for the first time in my life for 2 weeks - and will be away from them for all of that time. My mother will be looking after them which I'm grateful for. But I'm still fucking terrified.. Of course of the simple prospect that I've got to be without them, but also cause what if something happens. A medical emergency. One of them goes missing. Cause they're indoor cats and one wrong move is from my family in that house is all it takes, and one of them could go out and get lost. It's fucking scaring me just typing about it.. It's also the idea that, look I know they're cats and they don't feel like we do. But they are still gonna miss me. And that breaks my heart.. I feel like some of the stuff I'm describing and feeling is all expected and normal for someone in my position, but it's obviously the PTSD aspect that makes those concerns not normal and my brain doesn't cope with it all correctly.. I guess what I'm asking for is just any, literally any, helpful words of advice. Comfort, reassurance, logical thoughts, kindness in general. Anything at all, I'd be so grateful for it.

"Anyone Self harm? Is this PTSD and/or Complicated Grief? Anyone self harm in the past, if you want to share your story? Did you have PTSD also? Do you think PTSD can lead to self harm?

I¬†asked because I want to understand more about my husband's self harm, perhaps it also PTSD and Complicated Grief in his case.

Long story short, my husband's father died, while he was still grief his father death. In 2019 our child died of brain disease progression (genetic inherited it from me the mother side), it has nothing to do with my husband.

While my husband still grief our child death. In 2021 I had a near death experience, I was very sick, hospitalized, I almost die.

I basically saw my husband cries everyday. So so much tears from him, and emotional pain. Many times he not just cry, but completely bawl, so much to the point he had both hands on his head and bawl to the point collapse and curl up in a ball on the ground. His emotions is just INTENSE.  
Even in his deep sleep he bawl, I do not know why but tears just roll down his face and he bawl in his sleep.

When I was sick, many times he hugged me and said he very afraid (as in he very afraid that I will die). I don't know if it his father death, our child death, and my near death experience all build up together.

This was when he started to cut his stomach with a kitchen knife, he said stomach skin is thinner and has more nerves so it hurts more, and nobody see his stomach than if it was on his legs of arms, so he chose to cut his stomach, he cuts deep the point bleeding that he has bandage wrap around his waist bleed.  
And that was how I first time found out about he cut himself too was I saw the bloody bandage wrap around his waist when he took his shirt off.

His emotions is just so INTENSE, and his grief is just so intense it like he crave the physical pain to mask his grief.

He still has the scars on his stomach from he cut his stomach with the kitchen knife. He said if I die before him, he will die with me, because on the other side has his father, his child, has me, and we be a family again. His suicidal thoughts?

This man when I married him he has no scars on his body, after married to me now his stomach is full of scars, I feel bad that I blame it on myself that because genetics our child get brain disease from me the maternal side, that why our child died. And I blame it on myself for being sick, hence he on the verge of lose me too, so he stared cutting himself.

I guess a bit on the brighter side, eversince I recovered and healthy now, he hasn't cut himself since, he said he will continue live for me, I am the reason why he still living. This is why I am taking care of my health. I will make sure I won't die before him, because like he said, his exact words: ""the one surviving, will be the most painful.""",ptsd
"therapist wont work on trauma with me outpatient? i have been with this therapist for about 6 years. i went to her bc she is a trauma specialist that is covered by my state insurance/medicaid and i do like her a lot. we have dipped our toes into my trauma history and have done ""practice memories"" for emdr and have tried to do one whole narrative of a memory i consider to be less severe but still overwhelming. i have been diagnosed with a complex dissociative disorder and have had dissociative episodes when we have tried to do these methods of treatment. now, she says that i should only approach these in an inpatient setting, and just wants to do basic everyday catch ups and stabilization 

i cannot afford to go to a trauma and dissociation hospital (there is one somewhat near me, but bc i have state insurance and that facility is out of state, i cannot go) and also cannot stand having no active treatment for this. i know at this point the best method for actual long-term improvement is exposure and working with these memories, but i dont know what to do or how to stabilize to the point of being able to safely navigate these memories and dissociation, especially while still being able to work and help support my partner financially and emotionally

"My Journey to Health and my Silent Battle with PTSD Life has a way of presenting us with moments that define who we become. For me, that moment came through the eyes of my daughter. This isn't just my story of weight loss; it's about rediscovering myself through the love of my family. I remember the day clearly. My daughter, with the innocent yet piercing eyes of a child, asked if I could run to the park with her. The truth was, I couldn't. At my heaviest, the physical strain was too much. That moment was a wake-up call, not just for my health, but for the kind of father I wanted to be. I saw my reflection not in a mirror, but in her hopeful gaze, and it was then I knew I had to change.¬†The journey was daunting. Weighed down by years of unhealthy habits and a sedentary lifestyle, I embarked on a mission not just to lose weight, but to gain life. Each step, each meal choice, became a step towards being the dad my daughter deserved. 



The support from my wife was invaluable; we made this a family effort, transforming our diet and activities. It wasn't just about numbers on a scale. It was about feeling the joy of chasing my daughter in the park, of being able to lift her up without gasping for breath. I began to see food as fuel, exercise as joy, and my daughter's laughter as the best reward. Losing weight is often portrayed as a physical challenge, but for me, it was deeply emotional.¬†There were days of doubt, of feeling like this mountain was too high to climb. Yet, looking at my daughter, seeing her pride in my efforts, gave me the strength to continue. This journey taught me about resilience, about the power of love as motivation, and the importance of mental health in physical transformation. 



Today, when I look back, I don't just see the pounds lost; I see the life gained. My daughter's dream of having an active, healthy dad became my reality. This journey has been about so much more than weight loss; it's about the bond I've strengthened with my family, the example I've set, and the joy of being fully present in my daughter's life. To anyone starting their journey, know this: change begins with a single step, often inspired by the simplest, most profound love‚Äîthe love for your family.¬†My story is a testament to that. Every run, every meal, every laugh with my daughter, is a reminder of why I started and why it's all worth it. My story began in a place of trauma, when I was stabbed multiple times by three young men at the age of 17. It was a defining moment that altered the course of my life. This event that triggered my PTSD was like a stone thrown into a still pond, with ripples that extended far beyond that initial impact. Alcohol became my refuge, a temporary escape from the haunting memories and the relentless anxiety.



¬†Over the years, what started as an escape turned into a prison, with walls built from denial, shame, and solitude. Living with PTSD and substance abuse is like fighting a war on two fronts. Each day was a battle against the invisible scars of trauma and the visible effects of addiction. The hardest part? Realizing that I needed help. Admitting weakness in a world that values strength was daunting. But, as they say, the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem. For me, that step was acknowledging the havoc I was wreaking not just on my life, but on those around me. 



Today, I stand on the other side of what felt like an insurmountable divide. My life is not perfect, but it's mine, fully lived, not shadowed by the ghosts of addiction and trauma. I share this story not for sympathy, but in solidarity with anyone in their own battle.¬†You are not alone. There is a way out, and it starts with a single, courageous step towards change. Overcoming a 29-year battle with alcohol and PTSD has taught me that while we can't change the past, we can heal from its wounds. My journey reminds me daily of the strength hidden within us, the capacity to love, forgive, and most importantly, to heal. To anyone currently in their own struggle, remember: recovery is not just possible; it's waiting for you on the other side of your next step towards healing.

I‚Äôm a 21M from a South Asian country, and I‚Äôm struggling with the consequences of (CSA). Growing up, I distanced myself from my peers and mostly interacted with my family, keeping that to a minimum. To avoid worrying my family, I faked a social life‚Äîpretending everything was fine when it really wasn‚Äôt.

Support in my culture is hard to come by, and I‚Äôve never felt comfortable discussing my experiences with anyone. I‚Äôve been in university for three years now, hoping to socialize and make connections, but it hasn‚Äôt gone well. I‚Äôve made some poor decisions and trusted the wrong people with secrets that I shouldn‚Äôt have shared.

One of the biggest challenges I face is my fear of socializing with men because of my past. Most girls in my department tend to think I am a ""pickme"" because of my lack of male friends plus I think there is a lot of gossip regarding me and I feel like people maintain a distance from me. It makes it hard to socialize, and it often feels like the harder I try to connect, the further I drive people away.

I do have one guy friend in my department whom I trust to some extent, but that relationship developed out of necessity as I couldn‚Äôt navigate my computer science degree alone. I also have a friend from another department, but our relationship feels superficial. I find myself putting in most of the effort to keep it alive, reaching out and planning things, while she has her own struggles stemming from a similar childhood.

I am looking for advice on how to tackle this and be better. Also while I was seeing doctors they told me i was at risk for Anhedonia and I feel like I have developed it or gotten it or whatever because now I just rot in my bed or on the couch staring at walls or the ceilings.

"My partner left me because of my mental illness .  I know this will end up being long , but please can someone read through this . 

I am not sure why I am even writing this out . I think I just want to hear the opinions of people who don't know me personally . Two days ago , my boyfriend told me he wanted to break up which felt completely out the blue and unexpected and I had no idea he had felt this way . He gave me a selection of reasons why but after talking about it for hours over the past two days , it has become really clear it is basically entirely because of my mental illness .  I even went as far as to ask ""If I was mentally well , would you still be breaking up with me ."" and he said no . I already feel like such a burden because of my illnesses but this has just completely knocked any sense of self-worth I had and I feel so stupid for letting him into that part of my life and telling him my feelings . 

I have severe OCD which came about four or five years ago after a really awful , abusive few years . I have been doing way better with that , though and he never told me that the OCD was the problem , despite it being the most obvious and prevalent issue I have . He told me I have ""deep-seated trauma and PTSD that needs addressing"" and that I try so hard to ignore and conceal it but he can see how much it affects me. 

This is all so shocking to me because I have been living in a state of turmoil for years and it just feels really normal to me now . It was not until I asked him to actually tell me clearly what I do that frightens him and stresses him out that I actually realised that he is right to tell me these things are not normal . He listed: I shake for hours every night and bite my teeth down over and over while I sleep , I wake up at night panting and feeling sick , I cry and shake and feel disconnected from the room whenever I have sex , I ""can't be in a room of people without feeling like a black spot on the conversation"" . There was more but that was what stuck with me . 

I don't know what to do about this . I want to get better because this is not the first time I have been told I am too mental to be around . Partners , friends , family and even therapists have all told me at some point that they need to step out of my life directly because of the severity of my emotions. I don't want people to keep leaving me because of these things I can't help . I have been in therapy for years but it somehow is still not enough . But it has mainly been OCD-based therapy , not trauma therapy . I don't even feel like what happened to me is bad enough to cause this much damage . 

Where am I even supposed to go from here ? I feel so lost and beaten down . Not just because I lost my boyfriend , who I absolutely adored , but because those years of abuse continue to take and take and I can't do anything but observe it corroding my life , so out of my control . 

Please tell me what I am supposed to do . ",ptsd
"Being a defamation victim (I wasnt sure which flair to put, if I should have put another one I apologize)

Two years ago my ex falsely accused me of
raping her, no proof, no real arguments, lies who barely make sense. And yet many of my former friends believed her, refused to hear my side of the story, only 3 did and those 3 all realized I was innocent. I should have known this girl was not a good person, but love blinded me from the red flags. She was a person with a victim mentality inventing stories protraying her as a victim to get people attention, she even accused her brother of raping her which was also a lie. My social life was destroyed, my trust in others shattered and I was terrified of going outside, thankfully my familly believed me, after a year I got better slowly. And then one year later, she went to the police and filled a  complain against me, trying to destroy my life so her lie would have more credibility. I was interrogate and due to procedures I was held in custody for a few hours. Thankfully the police did not believed her and deemed me innocent and so they let me go, dropping the case, from the start I could see the interrogator did not believed her. It shows how her lie is flawed and yet so many belived her, I dont think she ever told her parents because we never ever heard from them, they didnt even accompagned her when she filled her complain (I know from the complain files my lawyer my father got showed it to me, its allowed in France). My custody led me to develop claustrophobia, I ended up moving away from the city I lived in because I was scared of seeing her or any of my former friends, who by the way threatnen to beat the shit out of me if they saw me ever again. 

One year later, this jully, I developped PTSD, over the next months I had flashbacks, I could see their faces, heir voices, her their accusation, I have nightamres of the event, sleeping became unrestfull, sometimes I feel like she is always around watching me, I'm terrified of going to specific places alone or at all. I even had an hallucination where my appartement turned into the holding cell I was put in. Since then, the subjects of rape, defamation can trigger me. Sex repulse me and scares me, because I consider sex as something very intimate I only want to so with someone I trust deeply. And the only had it with was her, it shattered me on that part. Even her name can trigger me and provoke an episode. 

Now, I havent made any new friends, I was shy before with difficulty to socialize but since then it has been a lot worst, everytime I get close to some, I can get scared and it triggers flashes and I cant bring myself to get closer. 

I have been broken since then, I can hardly trust people, I feel like she is still tormenting me, I can have an episode at any moment. Physical contact became something I dread except with specific people, the subjects of rape and defamation can trigger, sometimes the words alone are enough to cause an episode, I developped claustrophobia and sex repulse me. I want to heal and I try to heal, but its a long slow process, I know it wont ever trully go away but I want to be able to live with it and move on from it.

Thank you for reading, I cant confess or vent to many people so I needeed somewhere to let it all out. Despite being scared of strangers its somehow either to talk about it online on a subreddit like this, humans sure are strange.

"Facing my greatest fear I have done my best to summarize what is a long story. Please bear with me, I guess I am looking for advice or support. 

I have one daughter who is the centre of my world. I love her more than anything.  

In the time that I could have gotten pregnant, I was in a relationship with the man of my dreams (or so I thought) but I was SA'ed by someone else.
 
I told my partner and after long discussions, we decided to continue with the pregnancy. In all honesty, I wanted an abortion but was convinced otherwise and I don't regret it. We agreed there would be no DNA test as I didn't want to know if she had come from that. He signed the birth certificate.

He was arrested a couple weeks after her birth for very serious crimes for which he was eventually convicted for and sent to prison. It was a massive shock to me and I really struggled with it all. Anyway, I went back to school and got a good job. My daughter is thriving and I love being a mom. They have had no relationship for years as a result of the criminal court orders. 

He got out of jail recently and there has been negotiations surrounding me having the right to travel internationally with my daughter. This is basically the only right I do not have. 

I don't want child support and he is not allowed near children so there is no visitation. He is now challenging paternity and wants a DNA test. I am advised that the court will likely order this and I will have to comply. 

It feels like the biggest kick to the guts. I just don't want to know if she is my rapists. Maybe that is living in denial but I don't want that to effect our relationship. I still have PTSD from it all and I just want to believe it isn't true. I want to forgot. 

It also seems really unfair, he cannot have access to her and I am not seeking support. I wish the court would just let him take himself of the birth certificate. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this? 

Thank you. ",ptsd

A scratched floor, a messy room, a talking subject related to sadness (and then having thought of: Why can't I be sad about something simple anymore?), a song. My brain is in the works of creating more and more triggers, which I am getting IE therapy for. 

My question is: Do you have any grounding techniques you find that help you when you are stuck in a social situation?   
I have a wedding next week and will be one of the maids of honour. Though I am super happy for my friend, I don't look forward to it. I do worst in situations with new people that don't know, it feels like I have to put on a huge mask to get through the day and the things that trigger me get worse during such moments. I know I will get triggered, I am in a group of strangers except the bride and I do NOT want to go to her for help. (We met when we were 12 on the internet and live quite the distance apart, hence why I don't know anyone else).

Thanks a ton in advance.

TLDR: I have a social event coming up and I know I will get triggered and sad during the day. Do you guys have grounding tips? ",ptsd

"feeling lost in a new relationship a little bit about me: I have PTSD from multiple SA and a romantic relationship with a borderline person. I am in therapy. F21. 

I started a new relationship recently. He has been my good friend for the past 3 years, lately we started hanging out and the spark appeared. We had so much chemistry in the dating stage, I was extremely happy. Then, suddenly I felt really anxious and I started thinking that he might be wrong for me for some reason and idk what to do. He is a really cool guy, has all the important qualities I need, but I find myself obsessing and panicking over pretty much anything. I was super attracted to him, we had so much s*x - now I feel it too but everything is ‚Äúblurred‚Äù, I can‚Äôt feel 100% fine when I am with him. It started when I started therapy and I talked about my trauma, that‚Äôs why I am posting on this sub. I don‚Äôt even know what I wanna hear tbh. I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I feel anxious, down and distant - just as I have felt in my toxic relationship 3 years ago. Is it PTSD and anxiety acting up, self sabotage or am i really just not into him anymore? That would be so weird tho - I feel like if my feelings ended it wouldn‚Äôt be so rapid and out of the blue, it would kinda creep up on me slowly.

"Insecure about how ‚Äúahead‚Äù I am sexually from people my age  I (17F) have probably been raped 10 times since age 8. And sold myself sexually since I was 14-16.

Over the past few years my friends have started to have sex with people for the first time. And they tell me about it. I‚Äôm happy for them but it makes me feel so awful. Like I wish I could have that. But I know too much and have experienced to much. I wish I could‚Äôve lost my virginity on my own terms like them. I probably wouldn‚Äôt have sold myself if I wasn‚Äôt raped so much over the years. But I knew it didn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôll still be raped and treated badly no matter what. 

Sometimes friends ask about my sex life and stuff and I feel so insecure. Like I feel a lot more experienced than them. I mean obviously I am but I just feel like an old woman. They are doing exciting teenager things while I can‚Äôt even do anything remotely sexual anymore without being extremely sad. 

I feel like I‚Äôm grieving what my life could‚Äôve been if I wasn‚Äôt gotten to so young. Not even just sexually but like boyfriend wise I can‚Äôt keep a boyfriend because I‚Äôm so awkward now. 

I imagine I‚Äôd probably be able to keep a boyfriend and would probably have lost my virginity naturally by now or soon. and it would‚Äôve been a good experience. I feel like I‚Äôve missed the fun of being a teenager. Maybe it‚Äôs weird to look at it that was but I just feel like that‚Äôs part of being a teenager.

But everything sexual was taught to me through rape. Even masturbation was taught. 

I feel so lonely. And like to much of a slut to ever have a boyfriend.

"I was abused at a very young age for a very long time. Now, in my current relationship, I have no libido and no clue how to tell my partner. **TW: Basically anything to do with sexual assault, or abusive/neglectful parents, incest, etc...**

To preface this, I have already been diagnosed with PTSD, Clinical Depression + Anxiety, and ADHD. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, I just wanted to share my story, as I've never got the chance to in detail. Apologies if it's a long read. Also, a LOT of my childhood is suppressed, so the middle gets murky for me.

  
A big overview, or TLDR; I am AFAB, but I am a Trans FTM, so I go by He/Him pronouns, and from the ages of 2-13 I was molested, raped, and abused by my brothers and one other man. Now, I am 20, and I feel bad for my boyfriend,, because I cannot bring myself to desire sex. 

In more detail, I am the youngest of all of my siblings, and I was the only girl. I have two full siblings, and one half sibling that my dad had during a break with my mom. This didn't cause my mom to divorce him though, and by the time my half brother was 7, he came to live with my family. That's when my abuse started. Now, I was 2, so I don't remember the specifics. My mom always told me that I was most likely abused as soon as he came to live with us, as my potty training suddenly went away and I was wetting the bed from then until I was about 14/15 years old. 

I believe if I got into the specifics, it would be kind of redundant, so I'll specify just the basics. My oldest and half brother(HB) was the main and most consistent abuser. He went on to teach my 3rd brother(3B) how to abuse me, which ended up in 3B raping and molesting me repeatedly while I was in middle school. HB was also still consistently molesting me as well. My 2nd brother(2B) was the only one that never touched me inappropriately, but I do believe he knew of the abuse. That was my consistent life for most of my childhood, until one of my Dad's friends got drunk and molested me while I tried to sleep at one of their parties. It was the first time a stranger took advantage of me and despite everything, it was very different from my brothers, who I thought loved me. This led me to outing everything during a Christian camp, which I foolishly thought wouldn't get reported. When I was 13, HB was arrested and sent to Juvie. 3B continued to abuse me until I told my mom about it during the same year. My mom didn't get him arrested or separate us, she just told him to stop, and to be fair, it did stop. 

I however, was not the same. I grew to expect the abuse, my mind was twisting it to make me think I was waiting because I wanted it to happen, but in hindsight, I know that's just because I was so used to it. I became extremely hypersexual, from the ages of 12-17 I would say. I was engaging in ERP with older people online, obsessively reading sexual comics, fanfics, etc. I craved a relationship, but my dad was incredibly abusive, and besides school- I wasn't allowed out of the house, so friends were few and far between.

Fast forward to 2019, my mom divorced my dad, and we were finally free. My mom wasn't a saint, but I'm glad she did that. I was around 15/16. We moved, I made real friends and we were good all throughout my high school years. I got my first real boyfriend(and current boyfriend) after I graduated in 2022. Now to what the other half of this post is about, haha.

I was very sexual when we first got together, but something, I'm not sure when, just stopped clicking. I love my boyfriend, I'll call him T from now on. T has never pressured me into sex, he doesn't expect it from me, he doesn't shame me, and he knows my past traumas. But I am not stupid. This change in me is hard on him, I can tell. He has the normal libido of a 20 yr old. On the other hand, I have no desire whatsoever, and not just towards him. Comics, fanfics, yada yada, etc.... All of that stuff is like reading an epitome lol.

I am still attracted to T and I love and cherish him with literally every fiber of my being, but WTF!!!!! I literally don't know what to do, I don't know how to fix it, because it's not a conscious thing?? I don't know if I'm alone in this feeling, and I don't know if anyone else has found the cure.

I'm lost in a cloud of ""I don't know"", and I don't want T to start thinking it has something to do with him.

"I feel like I‚Äôve been misdiagnosed So I just started going back to therapy to see about why I‚Äôm unable to focus or pay attention at all when people are talking to me, which has been a reoccurring issue since childhood. After evaluation and assessments, my therapist diagnosed me as having generalized anxiety disorder with post traumatic stress disorder. 

See, the thing is, from what I always heard about ptsd is that people who have it will avoid anything having to do with their trauma relating to their ptsd or sometimes have flashbacks of said trauma. 

I was living with a single mom (no siblings, grandparents lived in another town) for all of my childhood and she would constantly have these emotional outbursts of rage when she got overstimulated or overwhelmed. I love my mom and she never hit me or anything, but I don‚Äôt think she was in the right place mentally when she had me. Anytime I would make a mistake, she would yell and scream and question why I did it, instead of just understanding I‚Äôm a child and make mistakes (also I was such a self isolating child and didn‚Äôt have a friend until the 2nd grade). Or just in general, anytime anything was wrong, I would always hear the loudest volume her voice could go. I also felt like she would never take me seriously when I tried to express myself in any way, whether it‚Äôs relating to sadness or not. Even today, when I bring it to her attention how I felt as a child, it‚Äôs ‚Äúwell, I guess I‚Äôm just the worst mother in the world, then‚Äù. 

My issue is this: I feel like I‚Äôm becoming my mother. I lived most of my life with just this one personality, it‚Äôs taken me years to understand how other people live and what others don‚Äôt take as seriously compared to my mother. But now anytime I get angry, I find myself throwing outbursts as well, then feeling so down about myself because I know this isn‚Äôt who I want to be. I feel like it‚Äôs a response I‚Äôm so used to because it was so normal in my house to react so dramatically everytime an event happened.

I feel like I‚Äôm not avoiding the trauma, but subconsciously reliving it in my daily life. Can PTSD trauma also come from not a single event, but a collection of triggers and emotional responses from your environment when you were a kid?  Maybe it‚Äôs genetic. ",ptsd

Lately I've had trouble wearing tight clothes. I won't get into what exactly happened but wearing tight clothes around the chest/neck is difficult. I also had a panic attack where I couldn't breathe and thought I was going to die. All of this because of *you*. I will never forgive. And you will have to live with the consequences of that.

"idk what to do so my boyfriend got super drunk at new year and got pancreatitis, was hospitalized for a few weeks. i was in a really bad way at the time with my mental health and already in hospital myself. i suffer from anorexia, anxiety and seasonal depression so am often in hospital that time of year. anyway. i was convinced he was going to die and he was my only reason for living so it was pretty much the worst time of my life. i was put on 1:1 supervision with nurses and tube fed because i was just completely incapable of keeping myself safe and would try end it at every opportunity.

skip forward to now, he‚Äôs completely recovered but can‚Äôt drink though has discovered he can smoke weed. i‚Äôm doing better with my own stuff but have developed ptsd from the trauma from the beginning of this year. i‚Äôm currently staying with family in california (we‚Äôre from england) to try and help my seasonal depression and, for the most part, it‚Äôs working. apart from when my boyfriend smokes. midnight is 4pm here so even though he doesn‚Äôt smoke till late there‚Äôs no way of me sleeping through it like i did back home- i‚Äôm always awake when he does it. and knowing he‚Äôs high just brings back all the emotions of when he was so drunk he couldn‚Äôt communicate and then again when he was super medicated in the hospital. i spiral every time, my anxiety goes crazy and i can‚Äôt even call my mum for support because she‚Äôs asleep. i genuinely feel so helpless and don‚Äôt know what to do or how to cope with the flashbacks and experiencing anxiety like this. i know no one with ptsd in real life to get advice from so i thought id try asking online. i know he‚Äôll be smoking tomorrow and just can‚Äôt deal with facing these emotions anymore.

for a while, i thought it was getting better, but ive realized it was because i was relapsing with my anorexia and was using that as a distraction from everything. i‚Äôm back on track now and really don‚Äôt want a relapse to be the only coping strategy. any help would be really appreciated ",ptsd

"It's a long story but here I go Hello, my name is E ( Female 28yo native french). I'm not sure where to start to be honest, there's a lot to uncover, it's going to be a very long post so brace yourselves those who will read this.

I was born in Paris but lived in a very very small village in the countryside maybe 2hs away from paris until I was 10yo, I have a twin brother born on the same day just minutes apart from me. My dad had us when he was around 20 and my mom around 30.

My mom left my dad when we were reaching 6yo (just 1 or 2 months before our birthday) because my dad would threaten to kill and bury her in the garden, she seeked advice from a psychiatrist who told her he would kill her if she didn't leave, but not to worry about us, we weren't his target, so she left. We saw her every weekends and every wednesday (no school on wednesday for elementary students)

I don't recall anything from this period apart from my father going out with another woman (N) who had a child around 3 years younger than us. The child A was subjected to violence like us. My mom told us about how the mom would hit me and my brother where it didn't show, stomach, back, thighs, butt. I saw a picture of a long and large bruise on one of our thigh (think it was my brother) my mom took as evidence to show to the police.

The only thing I remember from her is how she kept screaming with my dad about how they would throw A from the window if she didn't stop crying (from my room on the 1rst floor). The mom eventually broke her daughter's wrists (yes, both wrists) and was placed under surveillance and lost custody of A. My dad was also under surveillance and my mom told me he calmed down for a while because of it. They eventually broke up not long after.

When we were around 7-8 my dad found another girlfriend (Na) who liked me but not my brother. She had a son with my dad so it's my half brother (JD). Again I don't recall much from her apart from her shutting off my brother from interacting with me when she was here. I didn't have the best relationship with my brother so I didn't really care about him being left out because of her, I just wanted to play with my toys in peace. 

One fateful day, when JD was a few months old, I was taking care of him because his mom wasn't home (and I was the only girl in the house, despite being 7-8) while my dad was showering. My brother started crying for god knows what reason, my dad because very mad because of the noise and started yelling from the shower about how he'll kill him if he didn't shut up, he kept screaming so I feared for his life. Later in the day when the mom came back, I told her about the threats and she took immediate action.

The next day she brought me in the car with her and her dad, kept me in the car while she went to the police station, stayed there for a long time. That's the extent of my memory from her. She left with all her belongings when my dad wasn't home with JD. My dad knew it was me who snitched on him, I have no idea what happened to me after that.

Now this part will be events that frequently happened and may or may not have happened while my dad was in a relationship with someone.

So for starter, I was a loner at school. I was shunned from every kind of group there was (it was a very small village so we were around 200 kids at school from kindergarten to highest grade elementary school). Sometimes I was included in the only female group of my class, but most of the time I wasn't.

I ate linden on breaks and played with insects like bees and bumblebees without hurting them, just catch and observe them. I was incredibly lonely, looking back on it. I can't describe with any kind of word how it feels even now. Just incredibly lonely and alone.

Now it's time to enter the main issue, food. Food was a problem until I was 14 years old. I'll try to explain as best I can. When I was around 6 a doctor came to see us (a doctor came once a year in school to track our health) and showed concern about my weight, I was underweight. For reference I was 18kg at 6 yo with a height of 114cm (2kg underweight), another better exemple was the last entry of my height and weight at 10yo, 24kg and 134cm (8kg underweight from normal girls my age) I was the same height as a 9yo and weight as a 7 and a halfyo. Anyways, the female doctor showed concern and asked to visit my house, so she did, my dad showed her the full cupboard of food and she left. That was the last time someone did something, if it was something. 

Still on the same subject, food punishement was common, for example, if I took too long to eat, I would eat in the toilet, on the toilet bowl (my dad didn't like slow eaters and I was one, unfortunately). The more I disliked the food, the longer it took for me to eat, sometimes up to 3hs and then toilet. My dad always ate alone on the couch in the living room, while me and my brother ate alone in the kitchen, we didn't find it weird, even now. One day my dad decided to double my food portions, which made me throw up the entire night, alone in the bathroom, just in front of his room. Didn't come to check on me once.

I'm not sure what to call it, but my dad would always kick my butt or slap the back of my head if I walked in front of him in the house, though it didn't mean to walk behind him. It was just easy to hit me since I was in his reach. Maths was and will always be my nemesis. I had very poor grade from the youngest age but for good reasons. My dad was strong in maths and couldn't tolerate me being bad at it (my brother being strong in maths didn't help), I would sit entire afternoon in front of maths problems my dad made for me, slapping my head if I took too long to answer or gave wrong answer. It was like that for years.

I was always well behaved compared to my brother, at least at school. He would fight on a regular basis (most likely from the abuse at home, he had to exteriorate his anger), racking up demerit points on his behavior permit (like a driver license but for behavioral purposes, lose points if you're a bad kid). I think I was hyperactive when I was with my mom, she had troubles with us, since we couldn't act as kids with our dad, we would do everything we couldn't at my mom's. She told me how difficult it was for her to take care of us (she made it sound like we weren't being abused verbally and physically on a daily basis)

Still on the point of food, we would eat expired things on a regular basis, it doesn't bother me to eat expired things as long as there's no mold in it or it doesn't smell bad, even my brother. Expired milk was probably the worst thing I tasted, I now always smell every time I open the bottle, even if it was opened earlier in the day. My mom told me she gave us snacks for the week but he would give us expired ones. My grandma would give us a box of food on sundays but my dad never gave it to us. He also took away all the birthdays and christmas money we received from my dad's dad (around 50 or 100‚Ç¨ each).

It took a turn for the worse when we were 9yo, my dad met his girlfriend from hell, and her mom who I would like to refer to as Satan. The gf from hell started controlling our food intake, even before we met her. We started eating 1 bowl of soup at lunch and 1 bowl of soup at dinner, no vegetables, rice, pasta, meat on the side. A plain bowl of soup for 6 months a year, for 5 years until I was 14. Which explains the 8kg underweight when I was 10. I found a picture when I was around 12yo, I had no fat, you could see the skin stretching from the armpit to the collarbone. Nobody felt alarmed, no adult ever came to me asking if everything was ok at home, despite moving 2 times and went to 3 different schools. Nobody.

I'll try to fit in everything I remember from before I was 10yo, before I moved town, before moving on with the story. On that note, I was doing sports, gymnastics from 6 to 8 years old. I liked it, I originally wanted to do football (or soccer depending from where you read it) but was told it wasn't for girls (my dad was a football referee) by my dad. My brother was also refused to do football and went on to learn taekwondo. Small accidents happened to me while I was doing gymnastics, from a broken tooth to a twisted ankle, but nothing worth mentionning. 

One day, my classmate David who was doing gymnastics with me, told me his dad couldn't drive me there today (his dad would drive us both there everytime) so I understood and went home at the end of school. Another classmate, or at least someone I knew, invited me over to his house on the way back. Now I will explain properly so you have the proper idea of the context. His house was on the same road, same side, around 2 houses away from my house, probably 10-15 meters if not shorter, it was less than a minute walk to my house. you could see my house and his house on the same road. I want to be clear on this part. Anyways, I went to his house and told his mom to call my dad, to tell him I was staying here and would leave at 18h (time I ended gymnastics usually), she called him and told him where I was. I heard him over the phone saying ok and thanking her or whatever, anyways, point is, he knew where I was, who I was with, and how long I would be staying. I did my part. Later on when time was up, I bid farewell to the mom and kid and left the house. As soon as I stepped out, my dad's car was driving very fast, stopped abruptedly in front of me, making a screeching noise. He stepped out, furious, grabbed me by the collar and slammed me against the car, he pressed on my chest with his arm and started screaming at me, about how he had no idea where I was, called the cops etc etc. I knew he was lying since I heard him on the phone. He kept screaming for a while and we went home. I didn't have dinner that day and went to sleep around 19h (7pm). My brother too but for another issue.

Another time, when we were with probably his first girlfriend N (with her kid younger than us) my dad wanted to show off in front of her, so he grabbed my collar (I was like 6 or 7) and lifted me up with his pinky, my head touching the ceiling and my back against the wall. I would've most likely broken something had he dropped me. 

And before moving on, my neighbor who was also my classmate, would steal my snacks at school for months and eat them in the toilets (we had snack time every day at 16h (4pm) and I was left with eating nothing, which further explained my weight, again.

Moving on to the main part, I'll try to keep it short since the post is already very long and there's still a couple of topics to talk about.

Arriving 10 years old we moved town to live in the same town as the gf from hell and Satan. gf from hell had 3 children, the oldest being a year younger than us, very obese for her age and 2 youngers siblings, each 3 years apart, so 9, 6 and the youngest, only male, 3yo. respectively G, M and D. G was obese, while the others were normal weights, I'm not fat shaming, it has its importance for later.

We at first lived in a flat, around 15 mins by car from their house, in the ""ghetto"" part of the town, the ""bad"" side of the town. My brother was robbed 3 times of his phone in the course of living there. We had our pet dog, medium to tall sized dog, who was called Belle. Belle was another problem on its own so I'll dedicate a part to her, because I love her still and I want to tell her story too.

The very first day of school in the new town, was a test day, the whole class had a test on various subjects, which I didn't do, since I was behind on program and had to catch up first. So I spent the day reading material instead. Now for context, my brother was in the same class as G (oldest daughter) (we had to old back a year at 6 because our academics were lacking). The teacher of their class was a friend of the gf from hell so she told her about the test etc. Around a week later the results were out, we were at the flat with my dad and brother, my dad saw the test results for my brother and started to ask me about it, I told him I didn't do it. He asked me a again, I told him I didn't do it. I didn't have time to start explaining, from the stress of him asking and the fact I wasn't a good speaker (I grew up barely talking) didn't help the situation. So next thing I saw was his raised fist into a punch, feeling the punch on my left eye and fell on my butt, still surprised it didn't bruise. Not the best experience.

I was mocked and shunned again at the new school, which didn't change from before, apart from the mocking being more frequent than last school. I'm not sure how my grades were that year, I'd say average (we score from a 20 point, average being 10).

I'll keep this section short since my memories only cover a few very distinct stuff that happened. Every day was what I would describe as emotional torture, or at least psychological torture. I can't describe well, it's just how I feel, even now after forgetting most of the 4 years with them. Every day one of us (between me, brother and dad), or several of us, sometimes us all, would be scold from the gf from hell and Satan, all evening they would find fault with something that happened during the day, overreacting or fabricating just for the purpose of scolding. Yelling until 3 am every day.

One day when we came back from our mom's on sunday evening, we asked our dad what we would be scolded on this time, he shrugged and said there's no reason for it to happen. We walk in the house and immediately get scolded for towel tabbelware missplaced or whatever.

I had to tie my hair in a very specific, ugly way the entire 4 years, once some hair were stranded and Satan pulled on it very hard, so it pissed me off greatly, on our way to school I vented my anger verbally about how I'd keep her locked up and torture her, sadly G listened attentively and reported it back to Satan after school. I wasn't allowed to talk to her or kiss her cheek as greeting for months (we greet each other be smacking the cheek on each side every time we meet someone, it's a french thing) I didn't particularly care tbh but I pretented to be remorseful of my actions, just so I wouldn't be scolded further about it.

One time I think it was either about a grade or the yearly total grade, I was being yelled at by gf from hell, calling me all kinds of stuff, about being bad academically (I had around 13/20 which is considered ok/decent), while she, on the other hand, couldn't write properly and my dad had to write for her. Funny stuff, really. Anyways, I yelled back at her, saying it wasn't fair that I was yelled at, and how she wouldn't say anything to her daughter if she had same grades as me, I was met with a slap, and made go outside with a thin top, in the wintery cold. I stayed outside until my dad came out while Satan watched me by the window with a grin, making sure I was staying here.

I wasn't allowed to shave (I'm part portuguese from my mom's side so my hair is kind of thick and dark) which contributed to the bullying I was subjected to in middle school. I was also made wear very large pants from the obese daughter, I ressembled a clown, I was very embarassed each time I wore them to school, already being ugly from the forced haircut.

Satan wanted me to have short hair while my dad wanted me to have long hair, so more than a few times she decided to cut it, never asking about my opinion.

I was't allowed to change in another room even when I reached puberty. I changed in the same room as all the children, gf from hell, Satan, brother and dad. Once I crouched to change and gf from hell said there's nothing to hide anyways. She also made me show my very first bra, on myself, to my dad, I had to show him my growing breasts. At 12 years old.

Probably the last entry from that time since most of the stuff is forgotten, thanks to my brain protecting me. We were in a commercial center, and G dared me to give myself a hickey on my arm, which I did. She proceeded to tell her mom about the ""bruise"" and she told my dad to bring me to the pharmacy. My dad, the entire way there, blamed me about how I ruin everything, all the time, as soon as people have a somehow good time, here I am, ruining the day. After a while we finished shopping so I went with my brother and dad to the car. Once inside, my dad would start yelling at me to get out of the car so he could run me over. He kept saying it while I was melting to the back of the seat from how I was retreating in fear. I told gf from hell and Satan on the way back and they scolded my dad, saying he took it too far. I didn't have to go in the same car as him for a while, only time I was grateful.

I forgot to mention my dad would always threaten us to abandon us in the forest each time we drove past it.

Now before moving on, my mom got custody of us 2 weeks a month when we were 14 years old because gf from hell got greedy for allocation money and lost. My dad, who told us he would abandon us if he lost, never respected verdict. Instead we didn't see him a couple of months and started seeing him 1 weekend out of 2 (which was originally what he wanted my mom to do) until I was 17yo.

I'll talk about my dog here, I want to warn people who are weak to animal abuse, skip this paragraph if it's the case. My dog grew up with us, she was very well behaved, very sweet, the dog I loved the most (I'm a cat person) my dad left her outside the house, no matter the weather. We brought her inside the house without my dad's knowledge on wednesdays (we didn't see our mom on wednesdays after some time), and made her sleep on my bed for some time. My dad would barely feed her, instead our good hearted neighbor just in front of our house, gave us a small pack of meat regularly for her, alongside snacks for us, that we ate secretly and hid the packages so my dad would never catch us. He regularly beat her when we were in the flat, grabbing her by the collar and punching her stomach. I would hear faint cries when he did that, often falling asleep to this sound. We were the ones taking her on walks at 5am and before going to bed. He decided to abandon Belle to my mom when he went to live full time with gf from hell, since she didn't want another dog. Belle died a couple of years later, from a tumor and old age at 17yo. I hope she's in peace and lived in peace with my mom and us. I regret not being able to help her as I was also too young to take action.

I had my first bf and only ex at 17. I won't go into details since, once again, I forgot most of it. I stayed with him for 4 years. I wasn't allowed to wear pajamas to sleep, since he wanted to be able to touch anywhere he pleased anytime. Often being touched down there in the mornings while still asleep, repeatedly telling him to stop waking me up every morning. He raped me the first time he wanted to try anal, without my consent. I kept telling him I didn't want to try, he still did. He kept telling me yes, I kept telling me no. I started crying as he didn't stop. Kept going. Was met with a ""I'm almost there"". I started crying louder so he would hear me. He finally stopped. I stayed still for 24hs, naked, against the end of the bed, trying my best so he wouldn't touch me even a little bit. I pondered leaving right here and now but I didn't want to be alone again. Loneliness is one hell of a torture. I knew I would most likely unalive myself if I left. So I stayed. That's the only time I would say he raped me but my psychologist and current boyfriend say otherwise. For further context, my ex would give me the silent treatment if I refused sexual acitivities, other time he would just masturbate to porn in the same room as protest. So most of the time I reluctantly agreed to it, even though I didn't want to. A particular detail is I lubricate very easily, and most of the time I'd be dry after a while, while in action, which further indicates even my body didn't want it. So the rapes would actually amount to thousands since we did it for up to 4 times a day. I cried every single night I slept next to him for over 2 years.

I'll stop talking about my ex since I don't want to give him any shine, he's a piece of trash, egoistical prick, who didn't account for anyone's feelings apart from his. I hate him and always will.

I also deep cut my finger because of the gf from hell who told me to work even though I didn't have gloves and had 3 stitches because of her. Almost lost a finger.

Anyways, surprisingly I survived all of this. From starving to psychological torture and abuse and made it to 28. I had to take medication to find proper sleep after 10 years of barely sleeping, with daily nightmares and waking up every 3hs every single night. Unfortunately overweight because of the medication but I started working out last week. I hate humans, and always will. I suffer from dissociation from past traumas so I don't really feel anything from it all. 

I've been with my current boyfriend for 6 years now, it took me a lot of time to not act like I did with my ex (I cried everytime I refused sex with him because I was scared he would give me the silent treatment or get mad at me), he's very understanding of my personal space needs and takes my feelings seriously. 

I hate my family, all of them, I hate all the people who watched me grow up in fear and misery and didn't try to do anything for fear of my dad. and I hate all of my dad's ex girlfriends who were nothing short of criminals.

I hope nobody lives through what I went through, and I would never go into the past for any kind of money. And I wish my dog peace and joy in her sleep. 

Thank you for reading if you made it this far, I appreciate someone reading what I couldn't say until I was 26. I hope you're loved and I hope you will be the change in someone's life. Thank you.",ptsd
"I need someone to give a fuck! This shit is way too much atm  I have PTSD & anxiety and the main side effect that prevents me or has prevented me from working is psychogenic blackouts. I also have terrible social anxiety. It‚Äôs crippling there are some days I can‚Äôt leave the house. I can‚Äôt even go near my phone.. I have these black outs when I‚Äôm under extreme stress and at the moment I am having stress from every single angle in my life. The black outs are manageable when my PTSD is managed and they have subsided until just recently and now my psychiatrist retired I have a new psychiatrist who is getting to know me my old psychiatrist is Mia so getting my chart has proven to be impossible , I have an appointment for neurology that is months from now to do the scan to show the proof of the blackouts, I already know that it‚Äôs going to show that because I literally pass out.. I need a medical verification form filled out saying that I can‚Äôt work. My new psychiatrist does not understand that I want to work but need this form filled out? probably because I‚Äôm not explaining it well I‚Äôm terrible at explaining myself. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm not saying correctly to him??? I can‚Äôt explain why I am unable to work apparently. The psychiatrist that I‚Äôve always had used to fill out these medical verification forms for me. He knew my whole history, so it was easy for him to do. This guy is refusing to fill out a medical verification form saying I have these conditions that I have had since 2011 and that that‚Äôs what prevents me from gaining full time employment. I‚Äôm 100% for trying to get a job, I usually have no problem getting a job but it‚Äôs trying to keep the job and if I fail at the job then I‚Äôll just be trying again, I‚Äôm okay with that. BUT if I‚Äôm held to a standard that I can‚Äôt uphold, when I fail I‚Äôm gonna be put in jail for failing to comply. instead of trying again! honestly it‚Äôs not even just the aforementioned problems I also have had multiple traumatic brain injuries ending in concussions and that left me with short term memory loss the last concussion was REALLY BAD. I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm tired of trying! And I‚Äôm not usually a I give up type of person,, I keep getting fucking kicked while I‚Äôm down why the fuck would I keep trying? ",ptsd

I‚Äôm pouring a lot of time and energy into it as I‚Äôm ready and safe to do it, but when does it end? Some say PTSD is a disease for life. I hope that‚Äôs not true!! 

Can anybody give me a reasonable timescale as to when it actually ends? ",ptsd
"I just found out something horrible about someone & not sure what to do Trigger warning: Abuse & SA mention, su!c!de mention, discussion of CSA/pedophiles 

I‚Äôve known someone since I was 15. 

For half of my life this person has been a caring and supportive person for me. I have defended and believed in this person despite knowing their criminal charges they did time for when they were young.

Growing up with a presumed NPD mother that I was the emotional caretaker for, I always knew that people hurt others because they experienced some trauma and are hurting. I‚Äôm also autistic and take people very literally and at their word. So when people tell me they are working on themselves and trying to recover and do better, I believe them, and support them. I just try to be as understanding as possible, and I think it stems from how little understanding I received as an autistic person.

In my teens I got mixed up with a guy a year older than me. He told me we were best friends. I believed him. He told me one time how his ex gf who he regularly called crazy accused him of raping her, and I defended him. As time went on he would tell me all my bf‚Äôs were controlling me when they had problems with our friendship/him, once told me how he compared every girl to me and couldn‚Äôt see himself with them long term (idealizing me much, ick), and proposed to me twice. If I set boundaries with his behavior I was uncomfortable with i‚Äôd be told I misunderstand and he doesn‚Äôt have feelings for me, it‚Äôs just jokes/were just friends so it‚Äôs okay. It went on for almost ten years. Turns out he was a liar, and manipulated, groomed me by slowly getting me comfortable with touching and talking about sex and increasing the type of touching/topic of sex, pressured, and eventually coerced me into sexual situations I was uncomfortable with and didn‚Äôt want in my early 20s, was trying to manipulate me into moving in with him, then only needing one bedroom, marrying him, then started a smear campaign against me the last almost ten years about how I cheated and accused him of rape to get away with it before I had even accepted what he did counted as sexual assault. He told people I was his gf, I was using him, and he almost bought me a horse property I only told him about because my horse trainer was discussing buying it.

A few years ago, I became friends with someone else. He used to be friends with the guy from the above paragraph, and admitted to me that the above guy ‚Äòtaught him how to get girls.‚Äô He later admitted to me that he left our high school back in the day because everyone ‚Äòhated him‚Äô because abuse he ‚Äòfucked everyone‚Äôs girlfriends.‚Äô He ended up lying to me about everything that made him who he supposedly was, playing victim in the situation with his ex gf and said she cheated on him (when she didn‚Äôt), told me how he had made mistakes (cheated on exes relentlessly) and was working on himself, lovebombed me, very possibly drugged and raped me the very first time, later pressured assaulted and raped me another time, and was extremely abusive. When I broke it off with him he had a psychotic episode and wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone, and I was a bad person for not comforting him while he was suicidal. I just wanted to be anywhere but around him, he was terrifying. He added onto the rumors my first abuser spun and claimed I also cheated on him, when he cheated on me with about 9 people‚Äîit made me realize that both of these guys went after girls in relationships to claim the girls were cheaters in order to get away with their predatory behavior and they had a whole organized system to relieve them from feeling any guilt and turn the blame on their victims. This guy specifically has many abuse victims and at least one other rape victim.

The last couple years the smear campaign has ruined my life. I lost everyone all over again due to them being told I‚Äôm some pathological liar and cheater, a narcissist, encouraged multiple people to play mind games and psychologically abuse me,m, etc. I ended up in the hospital, I almost committed suicide, I‚Äôve completely isolated myself. I‚Äôm still not recovered. I still have nightmares. My ability to function sexually is ruined, I don‚Äôt feel safe ever. It hurts so bad to have not been believed, and to have been made the target on ongoing abuse preformed by people for my abusers. It‚Äôs so fucked up.

I wouldn‚Äôt be alive today if it wasn‚Äôt for the support of this man I‚Äôve known since I was 15. He is in his 60s. He really helped me out in a time of need. He was patient with me and pushed me when I needed it. I‚Äôve known for like 10 years he was charged with sexual assault of a minor by knifepoint when he was somewhere around 18-21. He did prison time. He did therapy for 15 years, had a very traumatic childhood. I have believed he was reformed and was giving back to the community. But there‚Äôs been a lot of drama in our industry community due to his behavior with one young girl a couple years ago who had a bad home life, and everyone was bringing up his past again (like they would do every couple years). I understand her parents concern, as he was buying the girl a lot of special gifts and spending a lot of time with her. After he lost access, it‚Äôs been like he went through a bad breakup and is heartbroken and missing her constantly. He‚Äôs also been trying to get involved with more and more kids activities, and he should keep boundaries for himself knowing he can‚Äôt do that. Recently he settled a court case from one of his old victims suing him, and told me they were just coming after him because they thought he had a lot of money now. It‚Äôs been rubbing me the wrong way.

A friend dug up the reports. 

We read the victims testimony, and this man‚Äôs letter to the judge. She was 9, and he was 18. A third victim. Her testimony was so triggering and I cried multiple times. It was too relatable for me. She was a baby. He stalked her for 7 years after he lost access to her and reached out multiple times. He had reached out to her just a couple years ago to send a letter about how much he still loved her!! It‚Äôs what started the court case! In his letter to the judge, he talks about how he wasn‚Äôt trying to ‚Äòget back together with her‚Äô as if they were ever together. He talks about the situation when he was around her when she was a kid, how he was in love with her and she loved him too. How her parents said if she was older they would have approved. It‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt acknowledge how angry and hurt she was when she called him after getting his letter and screaming at him to leave her alone.

It‚Äôs fucking weird to read how he thinks and talks about the situation, the letter, the phone call they had, and twists shit. The stark difference in their accounts. She was terrified of him, and he was and is still ‚Äòin love‚Äô? I guess I always thought deep down predators intentionally lied and twisted the narrative despite my therapist explaining they often believe they have genuine affection and love for their victims, even to the point of obsession due to many being fit for cluster B disorders. But to see it, really see it this way, is so fucking weird and gross and bizarre. I finally see his behavior with the little girl as predatory and I don‚Äôt know if he has reoffended since getting out of jail, but I believe he was in a losing battle around that girl and would eventually give in if he had continued to have access to her. My friend described it like an addiction, and he got a taste of it again.

I‚Äôm horrified over what I‚Äôve learned. I‚Äôm disgusted with myself. I hate that I am so understanding and accepting and want to see the best in people that I end up blindly believing abusers. Even still I want to ask him for the truth and tell him he should go back to therapy, and trust in his desire to be better, but uncovering lies he has spun shows he will just lie and isn‚Äôt safe. Why the fuck am I surrounded by abusers every where I look??? Oh my god",ptsd

Thinking about them gets me emotional and angry. as well as remembering all the other mean things my mom said to me as a kid and an adult but I still don't know how this is PTSD.

I have a hard time differentiating between a gut feeling telling me that something isn't right and my mind playing tricks on me and telling me that I can never undo the trauma, that I'm a terrible person, that I'm beyond fixing, and that I need to keep people at a distance in order to protect them",ptsd

"Nearby shooting that happened last month  I have been struggling to deal with a shooting that happened on my way home from a commute. It happened over a month ago as I was coming back from university. I was just chilling on the platform watching a show waiting for my train to go back home. When this group of kids started running from a direction and kind of pushed me back. I was confused and kinda frustrated but I just looked back down at my phone but then I heard multiple gunshots right next to me. 

I was like is this a joke and I was not about to find out so I ran for my life. I usually commute so I‚Äôve been scared to go back on the train or even drive through the neighborhood because I have a horrible anxiety and get panic attacks thinking about it. I haven‚Äôt been to class much since so I kinda think I‚Äôm cooked. Does anyone have any tips on how I can conquer the fear of going back on the train? I hate driving there cuz it‚Äôs a shitty neighborhood where gun violence is prevalent. ",ptsd
"Found out my adoptive dad doesn‚Äôt even believe me and never did My adoptive dad told my birth mom that he doesn‚Äôt believe I was telling the truth. I confronted him today about it and asked why he thinks that. His reasoning, they came and got me out of the boarding school when they found out the only good staff member was fired for trying to make changes. He seemed to be under the impression that I told him about the molestation and that‚Äôs why they picked me up but that‚Äôs just not the case. Second reason, my oldest brother and my sister knew about it months before them. And the third reason, I didn‚Äôt tell them when it actually happened. 

The way my parents found out was because I described what happened to my therapist. I didn‚Äôt realize sexual abuse isn‚Äôt just when penetration is involved because I was 12 when it happened. My therapist explained how it was sexual abuse/molestation. She then told me to tell my parents and asked if I wanted her help to try to press charges. I said yes. I told my parents. They told my siblings. This is all about a year maybe a year and a half after it happened. 

My siblings might have found out because in one of the hotels we stayed in for a chess tournament we ended up in the EXACT SAME ROOM that the guy that molested me lost his butterfly knife. I knew it was the exact same room because they had thrown me onto the bed in the right and jumped on me and humped me breaking the bed. The bed was still broken. The room was identical. Maybe I mentioned it then but idk.

My adoptive dad accused me of making whatever I want up about the past to suit my needs. I‚Äôve never lied about the past. It honestly really hurts me that he doesn‚Äôt believe me. And I told him it wasn‚Äôt ok that he told my biological parents when he first met with them when I was 13. It took me years to work up the courage to tell my birth mom, and to find out they already knew. I assumed he told them when my narcissistic birth dad mentioned ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been through the same things as you‚Äù and mentioned being sexually abused by his dad. In his case it‚Äôs definitely a lie, he‚Äôs left his dad alone with his kids and me. And he‚Äôs a liar. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, my adoptive dad doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me because he thinks everything I say is a lie. He‚Äôs literally accusing me of doing the exact thing my birth dad is actually doing. And it‚Äôs something I would never do. I don‚Äôt know how to approach this situation and get my adoptive dad to talk to me again.",ptsd

"People are lying about someone having sexual pictures of me is that harassment? 17F I already have unresolved trauma from being raped. I go to college and I‚Äôm really upset because  there‚Äôs this guy in the college who‚Äôs a creep. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a rapist but there‚Äôs rumours that he is. But for some reason there‚Äôs also rumours about me to make him look like even more of a creep because he‚Äôs 20 and I‚Äôm only 17 so that‚Äôs illegal if he did have pictures of me. People are saying that he has sexual pictures of me without any more details. Which makes it sound like I‚Äôve sent him nudes. Which I HAVENT I only tolerate him and he‚Äôs not my type. The thing is as well I barely know the people who are spreading these rumours. Like one of them I didn‚Äôt even know who she was because this is a mostly new class.

And I only found out about the rumours because it spread to someone from another class who knows me and he was kind enough to tell me even though they were telling him not to tell me. I honestly am so upset. I feel like if they are making this up that‚Äôs an insult to people who have actually been raped like me. And if that‚Äôs true that‚Äôs awful and I hope they recover I know how hard that can be but I don‚Äôt understand why they are still spreading rumours around that he has indecent photos of me. I think that‚Äôs a lie whether the rest of it is false or true because surely if they knew this they wouldn‚Äôt want to keep that away from me. And unless I completely missed him taking weird pictures of me there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôd have photos of me.

I don‚Äôt understand why everywhere I go I seem to get sexualised. I got raped multiple at 8,sexually assaulted at 12 and raped again at 14 then harrassed and assaulted at 16 and now at 17 this is happening I don‚Äôt know if this is considered harassment. But it feels like it. Maybe because of the trauma. It really hurts. I feel like my life is over. And I feel like everyone thinks I‚Äôm a slut now. And I guess I am probably the most sexually experienced person in my class and I‚Äôm hypersexual.

But I don‚Äôt get why. I have never really been openly sexual in college. Like I haven‚Äôt said much sexual at all I don‚Äôt think I can even remember a time I‚Äôve said anything sexual. Maybe like a year ago. But yeah I‚Äôm not like openly sexual. So the fact these people especially since they are people who I‚Äôve not met before September are saying these sexual things about me is so confusing. 

I honestly feel really anxious. I don‚Äôt know if this is considered harassment so I haven‚Äôt reported it or anything. Honestly if it continues tho I‚Äôm considering going to the police. If they do have sexual images of me that‚Äôs a crime. And even if it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs borderline harassment. I don‚Äôt want everyone to think of me like that. It makes me more vulnerable. I don‚Äôt want to get bullied or raped. And I feel like them saying this puts me at a risk to being those things. 

Maybe that‚Äôs the ptsd talking but genuinely I‚Äôm so embarrassed and pissed off.",ptsd

I‚Äôm a pre-vet student right now.

"Thinking about making an app to track emotions between therapy sessions‚Äîam I on the right track? I'm a college sophomore majoring in CS who's been thinking a lot about a mental health project, and I've got an idea I'm not sure about.

Personally, I find it really hard to keep track of my mental health progress between therapy sessions. I leave feeling motivated, but then life happens, days blur together, and by the time my next session comes around, I can barely remember how I felt throughout the week or what I wanted to discuss. There's no easy way to log my day-to-day feelings and none of my therapy notes are remembered.

I'm thinking about creating a transcription app that would record and transcribe therapy sessions. It would also let you jot down thoughts, track moods, and maybe even set reminders based on your therapy notes to check in with yourself. The idea is to have everything in one place to make it easier to stay on track when I'm not in therapy.

I'd really appreciate any thoughts, experiences, or advice. Just trying to figure out if this idea is worth pursuing. Please comment what do you think and below are some responses that can help me. Feel free to leave a number and I extremely appreciate your opinion!

"First surgery years after assault TW.  
I was in a relationship when I was younger and was sexually assaulted by my then boyfriend, now ex. I woke up with him on top of me. That was the second instance where I woke up with him doing things to my body without my consent.

Does anyone have any suggestions or may know if this trauma response is typical or not.

"How can you accept giving up control? CW: I write a little about feeling helpless and being abused in a medical setting. (Being careful about triggers and am vague in details because I don't know what is a trigger to others.)

I need surgery for something that is in the early stages, but could potentially make me very ill, damage organs, or even kill me if left untreated and decides to get worse. When I was a child/younger I was abused by several healthcare professionals and my parents in different ways that I won't go into much detail about, but it left me with PTSD. I've been in treatment for my mental health, but I don't feel ready to take on this challenge. Unfortunately this came up suddenly and I have basically no choice. Have the surgery, give up control, and potentially add more traumatic flashbacks, or don't and potentially get sicker.

Important context is that for many years the learned helplessness I had was so bad I just disassociated and let people do whatever they wanted to me, which just caused more and more trauma. With decades of therapy I'm now more likely (but not 100%) to freak out, stand up for myself and refuse treatment, or just leave if I don't trust something. But I remember what it was like before, vividly.

I've done everything I can to try and not cancel my surgery, I've talked to so many people and gotten some accommodations like a quiet room before surgery, but I wake up every day saying ""no I don't want this"". Just reading instructions for the surgery I have to stop because I start panicking and feel nauseous. I can't separate it from those old feelings of being treated like an animal or piece of meat, and I can't trust that the staff have my best interests in mind, even though some of them are the nicest people and seem competent. Nice people in my experience are sometimes hiding horrible things.

I had to go to the hospital for a pre operative appointment, and I kept having panic attacks and wasn't able to speak properly to the staff I needed to speak to. The words often wouldn't come out. I was getting triggered constantly by things in the hospital interior, and the worst was seeing other patients in beds being wheeled around helplessly. When I had to pass by the surgery areas, seeing the doors and some of the rooms when the doors opened filled me with such dread that I was sick. I felt like I was in a slaughterhouse for humans. Whenever I try to envision what will happen to me in a calm, rational way, I feel like I'm about to be violated again.

I explained to staff how I feel but I don't think all of them really got it. They want to give me all kinds of drugs to calm me down, but I'm also panicking about that. That means I have to give up control and be in that helpless state again, where they can do whatever they want. My brain DOES NOT want that. I don't know what to do. I just can't trust them. My gut says no almost every time. I have one more therapy session before my surgery date, but I feel like I've done everything I can other than ask online. What the heck can I do at this point to be at peace with this? This is supposed to help me this time but there's a constant voice of ""are you suuuurrre?"" in the back of my mind right before my brain remembers all the things that have happened again and again. I don't want more memories that keep me up at night and intrude in my mind all day long like bolts of lightning. I don't want the surgery to go bad again and then I'll have another regret and scar on my body to remind me every time I look in the mirror.",ptsd

Yeah a lot apparently). Depressed. Can't really cope with going to college and starting my new job anymore- all I want to do is be in bed where it's safe and I can feel fine. I'm scared of fucking everything- I had such a bad episode the other day that I almost called a fucking ambulance on myself. New triggers that I didn't realise were triggers- sometimes it's hard to figure out WHY it's triggering. What the fuck am I so scared of? It doesn't matter. I just can't stop. I have so much to do and I just can't do it anymore. Therapists won't listen to me- it's just fucking hopeless. I'm this close to starting to drink again, or starting to sh again, or just anything because I'm actually going to implode. Somebody give me a sedative!!! I have work on Friday. I don't know how the fuck to have a job!! I have to walk home in the dark even though it won't be that late. I could have a panic attack just thinking about it. I feel surges of panic every time someone comes near me in public. I just want to be left alone. By everyone else and by my head. I panicked going to the bathroom the other day because my bathroom's lights come on automatically and they were too bright and it's not meant to be a trigger but it scared me out of nowhere. I'm so spaced out. This life is legit hell and I don't want to do it anymore. Stupid stupid things that I shouldn't be scared of and I'm sick of the fact I am scared. I feel like someone's behind me all the time. I feel like I'll throw up from anxiety all the time. My acne is soo bad because I've started picking at my face more. I've started to wake up doing it again. I want to kill my brain because none of this makes sense and I'm not completely convinced that I'm not dying over and over and over. My friend had to tell me in my episode (because unfortunately I had to tell SOMEONE) that I was having a panic attack over and over and over and I couldn't believe it. I walked into the hall and the lights were too bright and for a second I saw it. I look for blood in the sink without realising that's what I'm looking for. I feel it on my hands when I'm sweaty. I didn't leave my bed until 7pm the next day. I feel sick and tired because my life is stuck and it wasn't even that serious and it's like I'm looking for reasons to be fucked up everywhere (it's like I WANT to be traumatised) and I just want to buy a pack of blades and take it into my own hands instead.",ptsd

"Had a very bad episode A few days ago, I had a very bad episode where my perception of my surrounding started to mix with flashback. For a moment, I felt like my appartement had turned into a cell, (I live a small appartement) I could still see my appartement but I had the impression it became a holding cell for a moment. I'm a victim of defamation, and had to be put in police custody because of procedure in my country, no matter if you are guilty, suspected or not suspected, if someone went to accused you, you have to be held in custody for at least a few hours before they decide if you are innocent or if your case will be decided in court. I was proven innocent without the need to go to court but ever since then all of this and outside context which add to that led to have sometimes have flashbacks of everything that happened, but it was the first time I had one concerning my time in that cell. 

I also think my time in that cell also made me a bit claustrophobic. Defamtion made me hardly trust anyone, I watched as someone I trusted deeply betrayed me and manipulated people I know to consider me a horrible person. And then said person tried to ruin me evern further. Now I scared of ever seeing that person or the one that blindly trusted her, refusing to hear me out not even wanting to hear my side of the story. Which made terrified of going outside to some places and I actively avoid them, leading me to move away from the city where it happened. Sometimes, I see her in flashbacks, I see them too, I hear voices of people turning against me. Even when I know there is no way she is around I'm scared of my surrounding. I still make nightmare of this, less frequent now but still happen.  And now I hardly can make friends, I get to scared to open to others every time I try, at one point I start to be scared and I'unable to get closer and even maintaning friendship became harder.

In December it‚Äôs going to be 2 years since my dad passed away. It was a horrible time for me. My dad  collapsed in my arms when we were dancing together, on the week of my 21st birthday, during my last year of college. He never woke up. My mom began verbally abusing me, and at some point blamed me for his passing. I shut down emotionally. I sucked it up, because I truly thought I was a killer. I took no breaks. While my dad was in the ICU I still took my finals. A week after his funeral I went back to school. I still worked, went to classes, and continued my multiple positions as a board member in multiple organizations. After I graduated I got a 9-5 after a month of job searching. While I was working 9-5 I decided to apply to grad school to get away from my mom. I got accepted and then put in my two weeks June of this year only 3 weeks before the program started. I gave myself a week to buy supplies, move, and another week to adjust to the new setting. Throughout the summer I felt that sometime was off.

"im getting treatment!!! ive been pretty nervous to talk abt my mental health with any doctors. a few weeks ago i bit the bullet and told my family doctor about everything; my depression symptoms, my dissociation, my poor memory and how awful i feel when something from my past comes back to me, and my brain fog and all that. he sent me a few tests to do (questionnaires abt adhd, depression, gad, childhood trauma and ptsd respectively) and yesterday we followed up to talk about the results.. and.... HE THINKS I HAVE PTSD!!! He essentially told me he thinks a lot of my depressive and anxious symptoms come from ptsd & it might also be making my adhd worse or keeping it there (i definitely had childhood adhd though) . the part this post is about though... he prescribed me cymbalta to try to treat some of my issues!!! üéâüéâüéâ ill be taking my first dose of it on the 20th and im genuinely kind of excited about it :-D he hopes this'll make me, in the future, more open and responsive to therapy, since as it is right now i genuinely really struggle to take and follow advice",ptsd

In the beginning, I thought it was just one flashback I had to eliminate and then things would be great. Unfortunately not. I think someone on the posts mentioned that trauma is collective which is true. Processing is bringing up so much more unveiling negative circumstances in a fragmented way and I have to re narrate and tell myself I‚Äôm ok. 

It really is more than one instance, what happened me happened when I was 13. Now, I‚Äôm 42, so it‚Äôs a legacy of events that are being revealed to me. Is anyone else experiencing this?

"Trouble supporting others  I don't know how to help my sibling. We have a troubled relationship and I long ago considered them my bully. I think their struggles are connected to undiagnosed ADHD. I am dx ASD. 

I had experiences as a young child, teen, and young adult that led to PTSD dx at 19. I received treatment 15 years later and am not experiencing PTSD now. 

Following my experiences and dx my family did not respond well and I was low contact for around 5 years. Contact is still fairly light but it is somewhat functional. One of the issues was that my family deemed what happened to me to affect my sibling worse and I was asked to support them through it even though I was unsupported.

I managed to overcome a lot and am proud of myself. I recently had a serious relapse with psychosis and responded well to treatment. Sadly during that time my parent died. 

My sibling has still not recovered from what happened to me and now is not recovering from our bereavement. I have encouraged them to seek professional help, I sent a list of nearby suitable doctors, I talk with them about how they can manage their symptoms. But they don't do anything. 

I am scared their language and behaviour threatens my recovery. I am worried about some feelings I have about their pain being treated as worse than mine. I feel guilty about those feelings. It's so very important to believe people but I am struggling to understand if the PTSD terms they are using reflects what I understand to be PTSD. I am scared that these conflicting feelings might bring the psychosis back.

Does anyone have any insight into how to manage relationships with others who don't seem to seek healing?

"Running Into A Wall ... On Fumes ... Out Of Road ... Out Of Time? Look, I've been ""holding on"" and ""hanging in there"" for a while now, and I seem to have survived episode after episode in the past, and maybe I am just in that depression space right now so am not thinking clearly, but it feels ... different lately, has felt different for the better part of the past two years, worse, somehow, even colder and lonelier than before. And I am older and more tired. There is less and less energy to fight this with.   
  
I am struggling to maintain the illusion that anyone actually cares whether I live or die. I know it's an illusion, even if it is a useful one, so why keep pretending otherwise? A few years ago, I still had one or two people in my life who'd occasionally talk to me in a manner that perceived as caring and genuine. Now there is nobody. I ask myself whether it was worth it to hold on, and hang in there, and survive. Am I worth the trouble, when I don't even fully unstand who or what ""I"" even am, outside of the projections, expectations, and impositions of others? My first big trauma, a violent CSA, occurred when I was five, so, presumably, I never really did manage to develop a proper ""self"" beforehand. It feels like it's always been this way, even through all the years when my ""resilient"" child self basically ignored what happened completely.

I'm on meds, in therapy. Have been for years now (should have been for much longer, but my family and school counselors and such basically refused to allow me treatment when I asked, and then for years I was too poor and too busy fighting to survive to access it on my own, and now I only have that access because Obamacare happened). I went to support groups religiously. I've tried attending meetups, making my own meetups, tabletop gaming groups, and so on, and so forth. Just to find some sort of semblance of a healthy support network. But I am middle aged now, and ugly, and broke, and weird, and intense, and still very much autistic, despite a lifetime of heavy masking. I think I'm just ... on my own from here on out...

And fighting is so hard, and getting harder all the time. It's gotten harder yet, now that I'm starting to wonder what am I fighting for? For ""me?"" A person I ostensibly don't really even know? A bundle of emotionally stunted dissociations wrapped in a standard language and expression module? If I keep fighting just to avoid causing a few days or weeks of sadness or inconvenience for others, namely family members who feel contractually obligated to at least pretend to be sad if I'm gone, if not always to accept, nourish, or understand me while I'm here, (and they WILL quickly get over it), then I'm just going to grow to resent them for being my unwitting anchors and torturers, and I'd rather not.

I am not even really sure what I'm hoping for, or what I'm asking. It probably boils down to an impossible abstract, like begging to be told the meaning of life, or why mine in particular happens to matter enough to warrant this continued, rapidly deteriorating state of atrition. That's probably not an answer anyone can give ... but, gosh, I just need ... something ... please ...

"PTSD has improved but I hate myself for not being able to move forward. (TW: Abuse/Assault) It's been about 4 years since I was diagnosed. My PTSD developed after being physically assaulted by my brother (I had experienced all kinds of stuff from him since childhood). I was prescribed Prazosin and it really helped my nightmares, pretty much knocked them out. But I still experienced everything else.

Anyways. Nowadays I still have nightmares, and even though they‚Äôre not very common anymore they still leave me very shaken. I feel mostly safe at home, but a few months ago my brother yelled at my mom and it triggered me. I had to spend half of the day trying to feel safe??normal?? ??regulated??? 

Every night before going to bed, I find myself still ruminating about the abuse. Although I have improved greatly I wonder if I will ever MOVE ON!!!",ptsd
"I disagreed with my PTSD diagnosis until today (a lot to read I‚Äôm sorry I have always believed I never valued any of the traumatic events that happened to me because I never had flashbacks or anything like that. I never thought I had triggers. I‚Äôm just so beyond detached to myself despite my high self awareness. How I could explain any emotion, event or experience without any vulnerability or feeling to it. I rationalize my thought processes to death and just blow it all off as monkey brain responses that cannot be fixed. I may have accepted what happened but I don‚Äôt think I ever worked through it. 

However I‚Äôm starting to suspect I‚Äôve just maintained such detachment from myself I‚Äôve just been avoiding the truth. 

I am noticing triggers such as an online virtual reality simulation of essentially various social spaces. I‚Äôve had a handful of long distant friend and relationship fallouts, had friends shit talk me, and cheat on me in that space. These things are very real things that happen in real life, so why do I associate that platform as the problem? I just have watched people I love completely losing themselves on that platform. Now, everything can be enjoyed in moderation such as the creativity you can experience on that platform and sense of real connection with virtual reality. 

I made my long distance girlfriend completely get rid of the platform due to a long history we share over it and shitty things she‚Äôs done to me on there. Now she generally is a better person for herself and others when off the platform. I am too. However part of her still yearns to experience that platform to be social and escape there however I get triggered even hearing that‚Ä¶ I know that‚Äôs unfair, I know her complying to this is unfair. She says I live in the past and hopefully we can mature enough to where she can enjoy it at least once a week. That doesn‚Äôt sound bad objectively, so why can‚Äôt I bend on it? 

TL:DR I got fucked over on it. 
She would hyper sexualize herself via her attitude, what she wore, and flirt with her ideal types who would reciprocate throughout our first six months of our relationship. Prior to dating, she has had significant serial dating on there with engaging in a lot of erotic role play on there and drugs. She‚Äôs ghosted me for someone on there multiple times but the last ghosting which caused me to spiral in a lot of reckless behavior, eventually leading to an overdose. I was able to tolerate the game before then and up to a few months in of dating. Prior to this I was being lead on by someone and felt very used. Not too bad objectively. Prior to this, I dated a long time friend while not being ready to quite make that jump (due to the following information) and ruined a friendship. Prior to that, there was a girl I met off of the platform I was dating and stayed with in real life. I think she was abusive as she faked alcohol poisoning and threatened me after, I think she actually pretended to do coke and locked me out. She wanted a throuple a few days later choked me and then threatened to kill me? I don‚Äôt know, I feel no emotion bringing this up? 

My greater issue here isn‚Äôt necessarily my girlfriend, the platform, or any of that. It‚Äôs the inability to exist without her. I could not break up with her while our relationship was at our worst to the point I lost friends due to them struggling to watch me choose to suffer. When I tried to break up with her because I understood how incompatible we were and how I‚Äôm just holding her back from the part of her that misses the platform she feels so passionately about. 

Every excuse I gave was just another form of running away. Not fixing the root problem. I don‚Äôt really think I processed any of what‚Äôs happened to me at all because of how I react. There is a reason I react this way after all. 

I‚Äôve been completely unproductive for over a year now, slowly growing more hopeless in my abilities to function and how poor my distress tolerance is. I‚Äôve started to develop psychosomatic burning sensations in my hands and overwhelming physiological symptoms. It feels like a panic attack that just won‚Äôt end because of this new development. I only feel these mass overwhelming sensations in fear of losing her, sometimes agoraphobia from conditioning of prolonged isolation and avoidance, or in an attempt to leave her or when she tries to break up with me. I suddenly feel like I‚Äôm suffocating, there is a fire of psychosomatic pain I can‚Äôt put out, and anxiety attack symptoms. I have completely become fearful of any kind of pain, I think my brain associate her as the only safe space I can go to even though when I‚Äôm in crisis she does make it worse. As long as I have her presence I can self soothe. 

Truth be told, I take me wherever I go; any issue I have in this or anything, I will carry on into the next. 

I suppose I was in quite the vulnerable place when we started dating and I want to be able or have the ability to exist without her. I‚Äôve struggled with mental health my whole life and trauma I never even acknowledged. I need to be able to figure out how to work through this fear of abandonment, pain, and acknowledgement.

I‚Äôm sorry for providing like all the context you didn‚Äôt ask for. It‚Äôs just there‚Äôs a reason behind the way I hate myself, the way I choose to sit in the fire, how I rationalize myself to stagnancy in what the right choice is because I‚Äôve validated every side, how I refuse to acknowledge myself, how I don‚Äôt use people‚Äôs names when addressing them directly, how I only think I can be funny or a therapist, all of these are learned behaviors to a degree. 

Does anyone have any thoughts? Helpful therapies for Borderline Personality Disorder and Unspecified Trauma Disorder? Anything that‚Äôs personally helped you guys being able to be able to grow out of triggers and essentially face yourself? How to acknowledge yourself as human after dehumanizing yourself? ",ptsd

"I hate that I have been feeling so bitter and my emotions are on edge.. advice? Is this normal  I‚Äôll try to keep it to the point but obviously have to give backstory. I recently have been diagnosed with childhood PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder. I tried to just touch base on major moments that have happened. Otherwise we‚Äôd be here forever:
-mom had me when she was 19, dad wasn‚Äôt around, was cheating on her and had other kids already. 
-mom did the best she could but was not very there for me emotionally or even supportively such as coming to my sports games, (up until this day actually I still play volleyball and race dirt bikes) she was not a sports person really 
-some bitterness started because my brother played sports and she went to all of his things 
-jump to I‚Äôm 17 almost 18, I get manipulated and taken advantage of by a 42 year old, met him because he was doing the same thing to my friend starting when she was 14. He brainwashed and manipulated her so much that when he wanted someone new she didn‚Äôt see any other way. We stopped being friends because of him. It lasted about a year and a half and after my friend and I reconnected and realized how messed up it was (he pitted us against each other so he could have us both without us ‚Äúknowing‚Äù)
-finally made some peace started dating my friend since 7th grade and we got engaged, shortly after he changed his whole vibe and stated he didn‚Äôt want to get married, when I stated I was okay with it (I was crying still) like I just want to be with him. He replied ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt promise you I will be interested in you tomorrow‚Äù. I stayed. 4 years later he asked ME why we weren‚Äôt married yet, we starting planning again. During this time we discussed me getting a puppy. I say me because it is a dog I have always wanted (he knew) and I was paying for everything, put the deposit down and everything. Time gets closer and I shared a picture of the puppy and he texted me saying ‚ÄúI saw you said you were getting a puppy, we need to talk about that‚Äù that was my last straw and we were done. Had to move back home and readjust my whole work plans. (He‚Äôs now daying the photographer that took all of our couple pictures, including my boudoir shoot for the wedding‚Ä¶) 
-I get my puppy and try to start over. My mom then tells me I have a FULL brother she put up for adoption when he was born, he is not even a full year younger than me (hey Irish twins) 
-I started dating a guy I had known previously, who was recently divorced and has a kid now. I get my substitute license and go back for my Masters degree in early childhood/special Ed, got a new job at a school close by. 
-January of 2023 - my aunt unalived herself 
-June of 2023 - my biological dad unalives himself two days after I have my second sinus surgery
-when I talk to my boss (the superintendent) about all of what happened, she said if I can‚Äôt handle the stress of everything going on then maybe the jobs not for me‚Ä¶. 
-started a new job this August and I am finishing my masters in March. I am coaching volleyball at a high school so very positive things 
-prosecutors office calls me to talk about if I want to discuss the case against the man who manipulated me. My bf didn‚Äôt know about this because it‚Äôs in the past and really didn‚Äôt have a reason to bring it up previously. 
-so now I am just a wreck. I think everything is piling up, having to relive the past traumas and talk about them again. I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶ I am feeling so bitter and upset with everything. When I am having a hard day I just want to feel my emotions and be with people I care about. I have always craved the family structure and want to be involved. I wan that unconditional love. But whenever it‚Äôs a bad day something always comes up with my bf and he just leaves me to do something else. He says I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù him because I didn‚Äôt die. I don‚Äôt want to be selfish, I understand he has a life outside of me but it‚Äôs so hard for me because I can‚Äôt ask him to drop everything and be there for me but that‚Äôs all I want‚Ä¶ I find myself getting bitter towards him and even his kid because they have so much support and love from their family/families and I see people drop their plans to help them but when I ask I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm selfish‚Ä¶ 

how do you guys deal with these feelings? Do you even have these feelings? 
I hate asking for a pity party but there‚Äôs a lot of times I think about everything that has happened to me and it‚Äôs enough trauma for multiple people‚Ä¶ some stuff people will never experience, and I‚Äôm supposed to just continue on with life and act happy for everyone else?

I keep unlocking like new levels ‚Äî remembering things or putting them into context ‚Äî that just leave me like‚Ä¶ damn. The evil I have experienced is actually fascinating tbh. 

I met this girl last night. Most Chinese girls would never just meet a person spontaneously. But she did. And then she told me listens to heavy medal (very frowned upon here; I like metal), and is sexually liberal. We get to talking, and she reveals history of domestic violence, abuse, rape, and other things. 

Also she told me a guy choked her the night before we met, and that said married a local girl 20 years younger than him and swept her off her feet after just a few months. I just told her that she needs to call the police and that this dude is clearly a predator. 

We went home together to my place and we slept in the same bed. She took her clothes off and got close to me, and I just was not into it. I honestly just felt bad for her, like, that she was re-traumatizing herself. Had very poor boundaries. I woke up in a bad mood next to her. 

It‚Äôs making me think a lot of things. Like, I guess I see it as growth. I‚Äôm not into hook ups anymore and I NEED my space. I told her that I just wanted to be alone ‚Äî but then part of me is like‚Ä¶. Am I having an unhealthy fear of intimacy? 

It FEELS natural to me now to not want to involve myself emotionally with people with unresolved trauma. I‚Äôm not saying she gave me bad energy, and I don‚Äôt judge her, but it did feel like her reality is not one I want to step into too deep. This is natural after acceptance, right?

"PTSD ruined me My mother died two days after Christmas 2023 in a pretty traumatic way. She just fell over, and I remember waking up at 4:30 am to my stepdad pleading with me to get over there. The rest was a blur...from running in to see my beloved mom on her floor, to taking over CPR; to watching the light leave her eyes and having to decide it was time to stop because she was already gone, and I was just traumatizing her body. I have a large family, with many siblings, but everything for the funeral basically got put on me which was fine because nobody else knew how to plan a funeral; and I took over as matriarch for the family I didn't know I had antibiotic resistant strep while planning because I was constantly busy making sure her send off was worthy of her (it was), and quite literally almost died myself. The next months were just as awful; my dog passed away a couple months ago from blastomycosis, and she was my emotional support animal, and best friend. My uncle passed after that, and this week alone two of my longtime friends passed within a week of each other. My oldest sister, and my grandparents have no relationship with me any longer because I refuse to put up with their toxic behaviors which is fine with me, but they find a way to disrupt my healing. I was diagnosed with PTSD after my mom died, and my doctor put me on meds to help. They do, but the constant attacks are exhausting. I lost all motivation, and have falling so behind on my bills it's scary...I was a pillar in my community, and now my mind is clouded too much to function properly. Luckily I'm able to work from home mostly, but I haven't been back to work in 9 months physically....I try...I get in my car and I get close to the office, and then I turn around. Panic hits randomly, and I feel like I'm going to die. The depression, and flashbacks are horrible enough. I have to take sleep aids to get any decent sleep. I've gained weight, and my hair in thinner. Therapists are booked months out in my area. I feel so bad on myself because before my mama died I was thriving!

"When I Shared My Trauma, It Was Compared to My Sister's. i graduated on saturday, on the way home my younger sister mentioned my older sister (my abuser)  and asked what she was doing and i responded who cares, my mom then questioned me why we hated each other so much. i responded simply with;

a repressed memory of her abusing me has recently come up and I think that's why she cant stand me .

my mom then started to question what she did to me and then I answered that I was uncomfortable with sharing but it was traumitizing,

my little sister then shares that she still remembers what happened with her and her male cousin because apparently he humped her once when they were kids.

my mom then said yeah that was horrible and disgusting and my little sister said that's why I'm uncomfortable when I'm in the room with him.

i mentioned that's me with my older sister.

I do not have a bone in my body that would talk to or treat my kids the way she ever did to me and I can't even fathom justifying it. She is also a shitty grandma.

"I don't want to heal; I don't want to be real? Diagnosed with PTSD after an assault in 2022. I'm not having flashbacks anymore or active symptoms, and I can maintain a normal, successful life. But I've been dissociated constantly ever since. I'm so far away from other people and I'm just floating through life. I barely remember what I ate 2 hours ago. I feel like I'm in a dream and I'm just waiting to wake up.

I've looked at workbooks to heal but it all comes back to grounding and being in your body. When I try to, I have this horrible, intense dread. It feels animalistic, like the blind panic of a cat when you stick it in a carrier and take it to the vet. Just this feeling of ""get me out of here"". I don't want to be here, in the real world.

"Objectification/pressuring/coercion triggers Hi all, my first post here. I've been in therapy since early this year and was diagnosed with PTSD related to prior sexual abuse. I've been seeing a therapist and we're beginning prolonged exposure therapy. I also got into a new relationship within the last year and it's been really difficult for me to manage these new symptoms.

*Trigger warnings of SA and self harm

When I was 15, I began dating a guy a few years older than me. This was my first sexual relationship and I was excited and very interested in sex for the first time. Throughout our almost 2 year relationship, we definitely had your average vanilla teenage sex but mixed in was a lot of emotional and sexual abuse that I've been uncovering this year. I've always had a knowing that I was sexually abused by this person but specific memories didn't really come to mind until this year when I was retraumatized. I have had several sexual partners since this abusive relationship and didn't really feel triggered but now the triggers seem everywhere.

During this relationship, I experienced a lot of pressuring and coercion. Sometimes he would accept my no and cheat as a result. Sometimes he would threaten to self harm/commit suicide if I didn't do as asked then show me proof. Sometimes he would just do things during sex and I felt I didn't have a choice. That fawning response still haunts me and used to confuse me if I was actually assaulted or not especially because it was over a long period. I was coerced into complying with nude photos as an underage teen. I was taken remote places in his car and had to comply to sex, I was yelled at during and afterwards if I didn't seem into it because I was dissociating and waiting for it to be over. I would try to push him off of me or stop him and he would pin my face and arms down as he was much larger than me. 

I have had intrusive images, nightmares and hyper vigilance from my current boyfriend overstepping a boundary during sex 7 months ago. I got angry at first then disbelief and betrayal, crying and just numb, not wanting to be touched at all. The next time we had sex I was so scared and almost in tears when in that position. I struggle with feeling like he really understood the gravity of the situation for me and I comforted him a lot afterwards. He hasn't crossed a boundary again and we have good conversations about what we both want in bed. I was having a lot of hyper vigilance and rumination about being unsafe and taken advantage of by him after that. I would dissociate at any sign of being unsafe. My therapist initially thought I had OCD. Symptoms have improved with therapy. Once that settled, I'm now really aware of my triggers but having all the discomfort, unease and scared feelings coming with them. I know these are signs of progress but it's still so difficult to be in a relationship and have this happening so suddenly and trying to to explain my pulling back or irritability related to it.

I feel my partner is sometimes supportive and he understands I have PTSD. Other times I feel like he just keeps going and going with the sex talk and it becomes really triggering for me. Sex is very important to him and really makes him feel connected. Repeatedly bringing up how hot I am or explicit language about acts on my body can feel very objectifying and pressuring for me. What's prompted this post is him asking what panties I'm wearing 3 days this week and getting really hyped to have sex again. I feel disgusted, uncomfortable or scared he'll be mad at me instead of being turned on. It makes anticipated sex feel less exciting and more pressuring and like I owe it. I've felt scared about being pressured into things I don't want to do even though he's reassured me he does not want that. But he has made jokes about this, which feels triggering and makes me scared.

I feel my trauma has really impacted my comfort levels with any sexual  exploration now even though I have in the past. I'm sad and frustrated that this happened over 10 years ago and like I can't have a normal sex life like everyone else. During sex I can thankfully enjoy it most of the time. 

Just posting as I'm wondering if others experience a lot of sensitivity around anything that feels like pressure or objectification. I'm realizing how much the emotional abuse really played into what I experienced. I appreciate anyone reading. I move forward knowing there's hope to a normal life again. ",ptsd

"How to cope with being abandoned by the one you love My ex boyfriend recently abruptly broke up with me a few weeks ago because of mental health issues he was unable to communicate, a difficult job and abuse at home. He insists i did nothing wrong, I also can appreciate he was quite avoidant attachment type which has been hard for me as an anxious attachment type from abandonment trauma. 
I am really struggling to cope with the fact he‚Äôs abandoned me - regardless of the reason. It was really abrupt and also really upsetting to see him that unwell and that I was unknowingly a burden to him. We‚Äôve talked it out, I‚Äôve been given all the answers I need, he broke up with me in the kindest most compassionate way, but regardless i am still extremely disregulated and struggling and given me a big ptsd flare up for weeks now, with little signs of improvement. I‚Äôve done all the healthy things - reach out to others, exercise, eat well, go outside, distract yourself, attempt to convince myself I deserve better, get on waiting lists for therapy, go no contact, get support from charities, try to be my own boyfriend. But I still end up feeling chronically unsafe and scared, I‚Äôm in my final year of uni and im getting into dangerous territory with my fine art degree reaching nearly a month being away (every time I go in, I have a flare up/flashback to when I was a child, or when I make work, I think it subconsciously triggers things) and I recieved a diagnosis for ptsd yesterday.
To know the most important person in you life has chosen to live it without you, to be not as terrified of loosing you as you were about them, is a really difficult feeling with my past of abandonment I experienced as a child after facing SA. I would be really greatful if anyone who struggles with a similar thing in ptsd what they do to manage feelings of abandonment and self regulate. Thanks so much ",ptsd

"How can i cope with this and stop doubting myself? So I (F18) have had a really unpleasant experience which made me super vigilant when it comes to anything sexual (probably considered secondary PTSD, i've read messages of my mom describing how she got r\*ped and sexually abused when she was a child, but this is a whole other story).  
I started getting flashbacks of my dad touching me when i was younger (mostly grabbing my butt and spanking me), I also kind of remember him touching my private parts in one occasion. I'm not so sure about this one but i do remember him lifting my robe once while i was sleeping to look at me.

He has always done lots of commenting of my body, i don't wanna go into detail but it makes me super uncomfortable when he does it. One time when i asked him to stop (i kind of said it in an ""impolite manner"") he got angry and defensive (literally grabbed my arm and dragged me into my room and was about to hit me), so i just stopped arguing and instead i just avoid him as much as I can.

He also looks at me weirdly; I mean he really keeps looking at my body when i talk to him, i don't know whether he does it subconsciously but it really makes me uncomfortable (I can't see a reason why you'd keep looking up and down on someone that's talking to you, like just look into their eyes?), he once even ""checked me out"" and literally bit his lip and gave me the most gross lusty look I've ever seen on a man's face.

All of the shit he did/does combined with what i vaguely remember makes me truly despise him. It makes me feel so vulnerable and unsafe, it really distresses me that i get nightmares about it. I don't know how to think of him anymore, in my head he's just a gross person that i wouldn't ever wanna call my father.  
On the other hand i keep thinking but what if he doesn't mean it and i'm just interpreting his actions wrongly. What if i'm just projecting what happened to my mom upon myself.  
He's kind of nice to me and it looks like he cares about me. He's also really clingy and demanding, he gets pissed off when i avoid him so i have to compensate for it from time to time.

The thing is we interact normally, all of what he does/did is/was very causal, I just brush it off most of the time and I think he thinks his behavior is normal. We have discussed things related to sexual abuse (like seeing on the news that some girl got molested by a family member for example) and he does criticize or at least frown upon that kinda behavior (he's fairly religious, or at least he thinks he is). Although his actions really distress me, i can't help but think that he innocently does the shit he does and i'm the one overreacting here.",ptsd

my mother, who didn't take me to the doctor for 7 years and then tried to gaslight me into believing I had autism to explain my social anxiety after years of isolation.

she sent me the money, and she was the reason why I'm not evicted and homeless right now.

I think that the stress of going the entire month not sure if I'll stay housed and having to kiss her ass for money has completely broken me honestly. I can't sleep at night. I didn't go to bed until 5 am last night.

I knew I was in a dream and I would try to manipulate the dream to scare me to get me to really wake up but nothing would work. At one point I fell and then I was in my bed again. Another time I ran into my mom‚Äôs room to try and get her to wake up but then I‚Äôd ‚Äúwake up‚Äù in my bed again. 

A couple times during this I really did wake up but with sleep paralysis. I remember desperately trying to move and keep myself awake. I didn‚Äôt want to go back into my dream. 

I get dreams like this frequently now. They scare me and make me feel powerless and trapped. Is this normal with trauma?

"Energy replenishment What do you guys do to be able to wind down and rest?


I already eat healthy, take vitamins and minerals. I manage my breathing and been seeing a therapist for 2 years. On waiting list again for cbt.


I have trouble managing simple tasks at work due to brainfog, or working out due to muscles being flat and unresponsive. 

Tried being active in my hobby. I used to have this as an escape but it does require energy.

Socializing makes things worse from the stress of being dissociated around people. 
Makes me feel incompetent. I even slurr when I speak, as if I'm drunk.

I used to have my dad as my friend, he recently passed away 55 years old.

I am burnt out. Finally feeling alright for a week or two can still send me back months by getting triggered. Most people still remind me of my former partner. It turns me to a person I don't like being.",ptsd

So I had my first session with a new therapist, I was very anxious about it as my last one was very dismissive of my past (long story but basically I‚Äôm sure I there‚Äôs CSA there I just can‚Äôt remember it clearly) anyway I‚Äôve been diagnosed as having ptsd (although I think cptsd is more fitting) via the nhs because of this, now my childhood wasn‚Äôt great, mum and dad split up, dad was abusive and used to beat mum in front of me, I was terrified of him, he took me away and told me all my family had died and he was all I had left, this was all around 4 years old, anyway I didn‚Äôt talk about the CSA as it was our first session and my last therapist basically told me I was lying about it (why anyone would I have no idea) all because her hypnotherapy didn‚Äôt produce any memories. Anyway, my new therapist told me she doubts I have ptsd as that what you get from going to war. She said she‚Äôs worked with people with ptsd for 15years and she doesn‚Äôt think I fit it. Do I continue with her or cut her off? She seemed really nice otherwise, and I didn‚Äôt help myself by telling her everything, but then I don‚Äôt have clear memories of the CSA, just very strong feelings and what others have told me about my behaviour as a child and little things I can remember that could point to it, I really don‚Äôt know, is she right, could I not have ptsd?

"help :( It's cooked tbh . And I am well aware that I am contributing to this situation.¬†So I was in a really fucked up relationship last year. My ex was doing it all, all kinds of violence. But that wasn't what broke me. I broke up with him and he contacted all my friends to send them nudes of me. He blackmailed me to my employer and I got dismissed without further notice. He blackmailed me to my government. His claims: I'm a prostitute. I'm on drugs. I publish porn. I publish child pornography of my own child, I put my child on drugs. He put some videos of my child on pornhub that he took when my child was roaming around in a diaper on a sunny day. This is all really horrible per se. He nuked my whole social circle. But I was like fuck it and started a new life. I started dating my partner. Our anniversary is in 5 days. Right now he is working a lot and it throws me back to when he was working a lot in February but he was so shitty. He just came to eat what I cooked,To put dirty dishes in the sink. He also was using my computer cos his one was broken at the time so I was really isolated too. Whenever he had free time he went out with his uni friends (without me). In April I found out he said ily to all his female friends (and the girls he went out drinking with all the time). I have massive cptsd. Partly from what I went through in my previous relationship but the fact that he kicked me while I was on the ground amplifies my cptsd and just throws it completely out of dimension. Next month it will be a year ago that he treated me like shit, too. I was on a vacation with my mom shortly after we started dating and he ghosted me, partied the whole time, slept over at friends, battery on 1%. Later I went through his phone that he was texting everyone (including random girls like one for days 247 even) but me and he even gave his ex a birthday present for her bday last December. This I only found out in may. This year my birthday comes around and he's too broke toCome up with a gift on time. It was in September. Every time my cptsd is triggered I shut him out. And he has no EQ to know how to deal with it and everything just gets worse like right now.He has a lot of work right now and even tho he isn't acting like he used to but I keep having intrusive thoughts, spiralling thoughts like all the bad events accumulating in an endless loop and I know it's my trauma. He has no clue what is going on with me but I'm so on fire I literally wanna pack my bags and just leave the country with my son. Our anniversary is in 5 days and all I can think is I can't do another year like this. December will come and I will be so depressed about the anniversary of memories. And I shut him out I won't even talk to him because I don't feel safe to trust him with the pain I have because of what he did to me after my previous relationship. He witnessed it all. He was my friend during that time and the fact that he did that after I was so maliciously abused is hurting me more than the actual abuse. I don't wanna play victim here. I know I'm dysfunctional and have been. As I said I'm on fire idk how to snap out of it",ptsd

I've been home for 3 years and I feel disconnected from everyone,  I try to hide my true feelings from people and so far it's working but there are days when I feel so depressed so lonely I've had countless jobs that I can't keep because of my depression and I make up excuses as to why I had to quit always masking the truth from people.

"I was attacked by a stranger trying to steal my dog. Now I‚Äôm just full of resentment and I never want to leave my house again. Tw; gun violence 

A little over a month ago, | (28F) was walking my dog behind my house, a neighborhood where l've lived for years without ever feeling unsafe. Suddenly, a man wearing a ski mask holding a gun appeared from around the corner, pointing it at my face and demanded I hand over my dog. (Honey a 3 year old French Bulldog)
Something took over me and I instantly refused and used my body to protect her. He pulled the trigger right at my face, but nothing happened. He seemed surprised and tried again but it still didn‚Äôt go off. Then he lunged and started hitting me in the head with the gun, telling me to stop screaming and trying to rip her away her from me. I kept screaming, and eventually, he fled. Honey and I were able to run in to a neighbor's house for safety.

For the first four weeks, I was in shock, unable to fully process what actually happened. I started therapy, and things felt ok enough that I was eager to jump back into work. Im absolutely terrified to walk my dogs or leave my house with them now but that didn‚Äôt come to much of a surprise given what happened. 

But the past week I‚Äôve become irritable and deeply resentful toward people close to me who haven't reached out or shown any support. So many friends and people from our local frenchie meet up group have acted as if this never happened and tbh really don‚Äôt seem to care at all. I‚Äôve only getting 3 -4 hours of sleep a night this week and during the day at work I felt nauseous and had body aches.  But I assumed I was just getting sick or something. On my day off today, I felt completely fine! however, as soon as was in bed and thought about having to put on a face and be away from honey at work tomorrow.. instantly all my symptoms, especially the nausea, hit me like a train and I started to have flash backs which lead to a panic attack. I definitely see now that this is PTSD.

I'm wondering if the resentment I feel toward people who haven't shown any support will eventually go away or if it's something I'll carry forever? I don't necessarily want to hold on to it, but thinking that l could have died and people close to me and honey don't seem to care makes me feel a level of hurt I can‚Äôt even describe and tbh I don‚Äôt know if I even want people like that in my life. 

I work two jobs, but my boyfriend has been incredibly supportive, encouraging me to slow down and focus on healing while he takes care of bills etc. I‚Äôm considering quitting one of my jobs, but I‚Äôve only been there for three months, and as a chronic people-pleaser, I feel extremely guilty about leaving. I‚Äôm also struggling with how to even explain my decision since I‚Äôve appeared perfectly fine since my attack. üòî",ptsd

"Title: Is it normal to feel more anxious and triggered after opening up about my assault? I‚Äôve been carrying this secret for two years, and I finally told my boyfriend about what happened. I was assaulted by a relative when I was extremely drunk, and I‚Äôve been too scared to talk to anyone about it‚Äîespecially my family. After all this time, telling him felt like a huge weight off my shoulders at first. He‚Äôs been amazing‚Äîso kind, patient, and understanding. I honestly feel closer to him now that I‚Äôve opened up, but I didn‚Äôt expect the aftermath to hit me so hard.

Since I told him, I‚Äôve started recalling more details of the assault, and now I feel like I‚Äôm reliving parts of it more often. I‚Äôve been triggered by things I didn‚Äôt think would affect me‚Äîlike when a man stands too close or gets behind me unexpectedly. I start to feel panicked, anxious, and out of control. I also keep having nightmares, and I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm more on edge, snapping at my boyfriend over little things that normally wouldn‚Äôt matter.

The worst part is, even though I‚Äôve told someone, I still feel so alone. My boyfriend is amazing and supportive, but I still feel like there‚Äôs this part of me that‚Äôs buried deep down, and I don‚Äôt know how to get past it. I want to stop feeling like this, but sometimes I just can‚Äôt shake it. I‚Äôve tried therapy but I feel like I‚Äôm pretty self aware lmao.. so therapy doesn‚Äôt really help. I also have adhd so my mind will repeat stuff over and over. 

Is this normal? I‚Äôm having these mood swings, feeling anxious all over again, and getting triggered randomly.

"  Anyone have any idea why he SA me over clothes ?    I have an idea‚Ä¶.. like there was someone in the house who could‚Äôve heard me if I screamed. So that‚Äôs probably why‚Ä¶.. or because he didn‚Äôt have a condom n didn‚Äôt want DNA evidence‚Ä¶. Or maybe he was also like afraid I‚Äôd leave him n so he couldn‚Äôt date (and control) me again‚Ä¶..

  I‚Äôm so grateful that I wasn‚Äôt raped, but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  holding me down with his legs n aggressively SA me over clothes is kinda weird. 

  And disturbing‚Ä¶.. it‚Äôs so clear that he knew I didn‚Äôt want sex idk.  Or he would‚Äôve and idk maybe he was afraid to injure me (or afraid of me yelling in pain smh. And knew I would. And i believe‚Ä¶. he almost did after but he stopped himself I think. Thats the truth. I swear he put his hand under my shirt and down‚Ä¶. Like by my waist he almost went further after but thank god he didn‚Äôt. He must‚Äôve seen the fear in my eyes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ and how I was just like in shock not doing anything back idk. 

  Why does this confuse me ? I sadly think I mean duhh he wanted sex n that was made disturbingly obvious. Idk how tf he made that aggressively clear OVER OUR CLOTHES WTF.   

  The one that really terrifies me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ maybe he just simply knew I didn‚Äôt want sex n I was a virgin. He knew which lines to cross so I‚Äôd stay and question myself and even make excuses because it‚Äôs ‚Äújust‚Äù over clothes. He knew I didn‚Äôt want to. That I wasn‚Äôt ready.

"Feels painful to move  Lately it's felt painful to move at times. I get really shut down and even just getting up and walking can feel physically painful. I can tell it's coming from trauma and getting so overwhelmed or feeling really unsafe it's like my body just shuts down. The worst part of it can be if I try to push through it I can become even more triggered, feel even more unsafe. Sometimes sleeping feels like the best thing to do. If I try to push through sometimes it can help a bit but other times it makes it worse, it's like my body is yelling at me to stay still. The problem with this is that it is happening quite frequently it's getting hard to get stuff done and look after myself. Does anyone else struggle with this?  I do have health issues but I believe these symptoms currently are coming from trauma, it's happened before I developed health issues when trauma would come up. ",ptsd
"I'm scared to go to class because of one of my classmates I have a classmate who I was almost sure has a crush on me. I've made it very clear last week that I am not interested in him like that and that I am not ready to date. He said, ""I get it, that's totally fine. We can just be friends. I really enjoy our conversations and don't want to lose you as a friend""

Today, we were studying at the library and he was like, ""Why won't you let anyone get close to you? I've been watching you and I can tell that you're trying to keep everyone at a distance."" I told him to stop asking questions he's not ready to hear the answer to, then we went back to studying. A few minutes later, he asked me if I would ever have a one night-stand with someone and I said, ""Absolutely not. Can we stop talking about this? I thought you wanted to work on this paper we have to write."" He stopped for a little bit, then asked me if I was a virgin. I didn't answer so he started talking about how he wants to be someone's first and to take a girl's virginity. Something about the way he said it really triggered me and I think he saw the look on my face because he asked if I regret my first time. I just started crying and told him that it was forced on me, that I didn't have a choice, that I kept saying no, that the man who took my virginity was older, bigger, and stronger than me

As embarrassing as my breakdown was, I hoped it would be enough to get him to stop asking questions and just write the damn paper. But no. He kept asking me if he can kiss me, then he started talking about how he only comes to class to see my face and how he can't stop thinking about all the things he wants to do to me. I ran out of there and told him that I was done, that I didn't care if he got a zero on this paper and that I actually hoped he did. It took me several hours just to stop shaking

He's never acted this way before, but now I'm scared to even go to class :(",ptsd

My heart started racing, & I hid under a blanket trying to suppress my sobbing & the tear streaming down my face, & I started sweating profusely.
I just fought to push it all down as hard & fast as I could, so I could show my face again. I just held it at an angle where I still couldn't be fully seen.

"Hypersexuality and being a little confused  So, last year, I 21F was S/A and then a few months later robbed. I already had a history of sexual abuse beforehand, I have been in therapy, and thankfully, it's helped me from being hypersexual. However, I did have a moment of weakness and hooked up with a 49M. I do know the age gap is horrible, and I regret it, not here to justify. However, I feel like having sex with him has been in my flashbacks?? Nothing traumatic happened, and it was 100% consensual, I know now it was creepy, but the sex is something I said yes to. The flashbacks started a couple weeks after and not during, and all I'm seeing is you get triggered WHILE have consenting sex not weeks after. I honestly feel disgusting and horrible and am just really confused and want advice or to know other people have gone through something similar because I feel alone and ashamed.

"i made a little den in my wardrobe for whenever i can't sleep at night (aka every fuckin night LOL) Tbh i don't know whether this will work or not. over the past few months i've realised that the core reason i can't get to sleep at night is bc - of many things - my body doesn't physically feel safe enough to sleep. As in, \*i will die in this position\*, kind of thing.

I realised from reading about other people's stuff that it's not always a bad thing to 'give in' to that kind of fear, to actually play along with it and allow urself to go sleep somewhere else, even if it's on the bare floor. That's something I've never allowed myself to do.

I'm at the stage where I'm not trying to cure shit, just putting in little adaptations to avoid all the stuff that causes me so much trouble, putting it lightly. 

So it might not be on a therapist's 'success' list to be unable to sleep in a bed in a normal way, but i'm going to see what happens with this. 

I've made a little den where i can drag my pillows and duvet and blankets into the open wardrobe, and basically hide underneath all the stuff but with the lights on lmao. gonna think about getting some fairy lights.

  
But yeah, basic summary of post is: try doing that stupid harmless thing your animal brain wants to do in order to feel safe.

I also mirror people and speak to them in ways that I think they want to hear even if it's not true to how I feel. It has led to a lot of shame in my life by mirroring bad people because, I was lonely and wanted to have someone to connect to and make friends.  I feel disgusted with myself and want to break this pattern.  Have any of you learned any skills to deal with a trauma response.  I was even raped and in my head I was screaming but I thought this is already happening and just did whatever i could to make it over with fastest.  He probably thought I loved it and from his perspective he would not know that it was rape to me.  Have any of you learned skills on how not to do this?",ptsd
Stellate ganglion block I have CPTSD but a very overactive nervous system with fibromyalgia. I heard about SGB in my neuropsychology class but they demonstrated it on war veterans. Is it a solid bandaid to help improve your therapy experience? ,ptsd
Figuring out which memories are really your worst with CPTSD  We are doing one that's finally seeming to get a response from my body more.

"Anxious abusive husband This is basically a vent.  After feeling this way for years, and every professional I see asking why I am still married, I know what I have to do.

Most recently I sought out adhd testing, sure it is something wrong with my brain.  The psychologist is adamant I can‚Äôt have adhd because it is developmental and that I have ptsd caused by my husband.  Not earth shattering considering he had extreme reactions including punching holes in our house walls and leaving erratically saying he was going to commit suicide, leaving me with a small 2 year old crying.

I left this summer when his aggressive behavior made my kids cry and scared, not to mention my nervous system.  He would not let me leave or go without constant communication.  He swore he would change, found quite literally 4 therapists he was seeing all at the same time.  I asked him to leave so we could come home, he agreed, then did not leave.  

Now it‚Äôs back to the old ways.  His presence triggers me so I try to peacefully avoid him and protect myself.  This morning he came home(I never know when to expect this so I gave my earplugs handy), said ‚Äúhi‚Äù, I said ‚Äúhi‚Äù, and he said ‚ÄúI said HI‚Äù.  I said I said hi and removed myself to another room.  He came in and said we have some administrative things to take care of.  I say ok, he tells me, I say ok.  He goes upstairs and texts me ‚ÄúI have a few things to get off my chest.  We need to talk later‚Äù.  This elevates me and I tell him it is unfair that he does that especially first thing in the morning.  

I finally just go upstairs to ask him what he needs to get off his chest, extremely elevated at this point.  And he won‚Äôt tell me,  we need to schedule a time to talk later.  I continue to ask him to please just tell me the bullet points.  He refuses and continues to lecture me about how all of this is harder for him because he has an anxious attachment.  He regularly has ‚Äúmeetings‚Äù with me where he is the only one who talks.  Look, I know he has zero care for me, it‚Äôs all about control.  Shortly later he slammed a door very loudly to the point both my kids said they were scared.  

How can I survive in this environment while making a plan to leave?  My nervous system is shot, but resisting him makes everything so much worse.  I hate him in the depths of my soul.  Please be gentle.

"Triggered in class I‚Äôm currently enrolled in a neurobiology of PTSD class where we‚Äôve touched on stuff difficult subjects, but they have all been related to brain function, previous research ect. (e.g. prolonged exposure for fighter fighters and hippocampal volume). And today we had a guest lecturer who‚Äôs really known in the field so I was super excited to learn more about her research and we were assigned some of her papers to read over. This Professor came to class and started recounting how she was molested by her grandfather, date raped, and violently raped in extreme detail. She also talked about telling her friends/parents about what happened and how they were supportive and helped her heal which was the most triggering thing because I had the complete opposite experienceüò≠üò≠ she told us we could step out in the beginning of class but I didn‚Äôt because I didn‚Äôt want to be disrespectful/out myself but I feel like we should have been told this earlier and given permission to skip this lecture as we did not go over any information related to the course content and the purpose was to have us speak to someone who has PTSD. I feel so dumb because I signed up for this class and should be more resilient in these situations but I just got triggered so bad. I was trying not to cry the whole timeüòîüòî",ptsd
"My trauma was deemed not dangerous or severe enough to get a PTSD diagnosis  My doctor said my medical trauma of an emergency surgery with malpractice, is not severe enough to diagnose me with PTSD. They're really strict about the ptsd diagnosis here, pretty much only getting attacked or going to war will qualify you.

I don't know where to go from here, it's on my record that I didn't get a diagnosis, and I won't be able to try again. Starting in therapy soon, I'll see what she can do for me.",ptsd
"Am I wrong to be upset T ignored my call for two weeks when I was in distress?  I signed up to do 3 ketamine treatments (one per week) and had to cancel my appointments with my T for those weeks because of scheduling issues. I did the first treatment and it was horrific. It brought up all of this nightmarish trauma and launched me into much worse anxiety and depression. The next day, I called my T and left a message while crying, detailing about how I'm in a really bad place after the first treatment and was wondering if we could meet during my time slot or another one that week. I said it was urgent because I am a mess and don't know whether it's safe for me to go back for the next sessions.

T doesn't call me until two days later and I miss the call. They say they're sorry I'm in a bad spot and that they missed me and they'll try me again next week. I call back within minutes, asking if they can please call me back this week even for a few minutes because next week is my 2nd session and I don't know whether to go back. They don't call me back for TWO weeks so after my 3rd session (I did go back. It was awful) and again I miss the call. They leave a message saying they are only calling back now because they know I have been busy with the ketamine sessions and that they are available to schedule an appointment the following week to resume our sessions and talk about how the ketamine treatments went.

I've had a couple of sessions with T since and I can't let go of how they basically ignored me when I was in need of help.  I can completely understand if they didn't have time for a session when I reached out, but the least they could have done was call me back when I'm in obvious distress for even a minute. At our first session after, all they said was ""I'm sorry we kept missing each other.""",ptsd
"Do I have it? I really need some help in determining whether I could possibly have PTSD. I‚Äôm currently in the process of moving states so getting a therapist at the moment is pretty hard for me on top of everything else I have to do.

I ended up finding my father dead in his bathroom on the floor from a possible heart attack due to the chemo he was on back in August. I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm in denial of me possibly having PTSD or if I‚Äôm using it as some sort of excuse‚Ä¶.

I do not ever go into his bathroom. The only time I‚Äôve done so is when I was drunk and decided to apologize for not finding him quicker and feeling like I‚Äôm to blame for his death due to me taking him to the hospital months before to find out a tumor was growing inside of him. I rarely even go into his room.  There‚Äôs not a day where I don‚Äôt think about finding him. It‚Äôs so hard to think of him in a positive light because it‚Äôs all I see in my head recently. Even when I‚Äôm out with friends or family, the image randomly pops up into my mind. I don‚Äôt feel like the person I know I am anymore. I‚Äôm usually very empathetic and willing to help others where I can but lately, I‚Äôm angry and can barely pretend to care about hearing about someone else‚Äôs issues. I do not get checked up on by family members ever since he passed and I feel like that‚Äôs part of why I‚Äôve become such a negative person all over again (I went through this same ‚Äúphase‚Äù when my mother passed away).

"I just dont want to take up again On monday I had a psych eval after a successful referral for secondary care. I've been suicidal the past months and self-harming just to keep myself from making the final decision. Yesterday I got the response from the eval, an immediate discharge. They cited that I hadn't self harmed in a week and that I speak to a gp and private therapist (which I can only afford with my job which i'm struggling to hold onto because of mental instability) regularly so there's nothing more that can be done. I'm so sick and tired of trying to have hope and being disappointed by every support i'm signposted to. I honestly don't ever want to wake up in this world again. If there was booze in the house i'd steal it in hopes being drunk will let me cut my wrists fatally. I can't keep doing this anymore, I just can't.",ptsd
"I need some help  Apologies its a bit long. I was diagnosed with a disease called Ulcerative Colitis two years ago and was on medication for it to manage the flare ups for roughly a year and a half. It got so bad that I was just passing blood every time I went to the toilet, I was severely anaemic and still going to the gym throught it all. I was called in to the hospital for a blood test, then the day after they said I would have to come in for a 5 day course of IV corticosteroids to try and get it under control. 

So I went in, was admitted to the emergency ward. I was severely dehydrated and in so much pain at this point. I was meant to be in for 5 days, but the steroids didn't work. They tried every other drug they could to try and help me but none worked. I was moved from ward to ward and despite my amazing team of gastroentologists and doctors they still couldn't help. Eventually they told me they would have to operate on me to remove my colon in order to stop me from dying. 

I obviously didn't want to, as it would mean I would have an ileostomy bag which was a big issue for me. However, I had no choice so I had the operation. The first 5 days after the operation went okay, I was in a lot of pain but not unbearable as it was managed by oral morphine and IV paracetamol. The operation was laparascopic, which meant small incisions = less pain. 5 days after my first operation I was in extreme pain. 

It started around 8pm and got worse up until 1am, they gave me every drug they could (IV paracetamol, IV morphine, Oral Morphine, Ketamine, Fentanyl) but nothing would touch the pain. It got so bad I was begging the nurses to kill me or put me under to stop the pain. They took me for a CT scan of my abdomen, and it felt like when I was being taken down there (lying on a hospital bed) every bump was a knife in my abdomen and I thought I was going to die.

They discovered I had a massive build up of fluid and gas in my intestines, and took me down for an emergency operation at 2am, after I had been in unbearable pain for 6 hours. I woke up in the ICU hooked up to 5 different fluids and a morphine PCA. I was told I had suffered from a twisted bowel, which had constricted my stoma and killed a small portion of my small bowel. 

I was in the ICU for 7 days and they were horrendous, I had a NG tube down my nose, a Robinsons Drain in my side and a new scar down my abs. They had not done laparscopic surgery this time as they didn't have time to, and had cut me open to find the problem. As a result of them poking around in my intestines, my stomach had shut down and I had to have it aspirated by the NG tube every 4 hours, and wasn't allowed to eat or drink anything.

Eventually I got out of there and was moves to another ward for a couple weeks before I was discharged. I am getting healthier now, adjusting to my stoma bags. But whenever I hear anything to do with ICU, or hospitals or drugs or painkillers or anything at all that reminds me, it all comes back. Its like I'm right back there again, all the fear and pain and confusion is overwhelming and I can't do anything. I have day dreams about it and nightmares I wake up in a cold sweat. 

The worst part is I don't feel like I have the right to have PTSD, like there are combat vets who have seen the worst a person can see and I have just laid in a hospital for 6 weeks. Anything have any advice on how to deal with this or any tips on how to manage when I have the flashbacks? Any help appreciated. ",ptsd
"Re-experiencing and re-enacting SA. Why and how to stop?  I have been battling with PTSD -which i just discovered this week- since i was 20 years old. 
Lately, i have been losing control on everything, my sext and masturbation addiction gonna uncontrollably. My life quality is declining since i stopped working for academic reasons. 
Things were okay back then, as i occupied -smothered- myself with everything. But now i am not doing okay at all. 

I have been SA when i was around 8 I believe by an older cousin. I noticed that my sexual phantasies and behavior is somehow very similar to my SA experience- which is awful and nauseating-, it‚Äôs like i was intentionally re-experiencing and re-enacting the sexual abuse. My whole sexual behavior revolves around this.

My question is: i need an explanation why do i keep re experiencing the sexual abuse and turn it into a pleasurable experience, i fking hate this, i want it to stop.
And how can i stop it from progressing and effecting my sexual behavior. It‚Äôs becoming self destructive.  ",ptsd

"  I‚Äôm promiscuous because of trauma now and I don‚Äôt want to be anymore‚Ä¶..   I‚Äôm not judging anyone who is having casual sex, but clearly it‚Äôs not my thing because I tried to do it and I‚Äôm really bad at not getting feelings. Maybe because I‚Äôm a virgin idk‚Ä¶.. I ended up thinking like if I do something sexual with a couple guys I will just be healed. My trauma won‚Äôt matter anymore. It sort of helped cuz I have had different experiences, but I still haven‚Äôt had any experiences you know positively with anything close to ummm my trauma ‚Ä¶..

  So now I‚Äôm a 26 year old virgin who is also damaged and just fml. It didn‚Äôt help that this guy pretty much said I ‚Äúshould be with someone n deserve someone who can handle my PTSD ‚Äú.  And it‚Äôs fine like I realize I‚Äôm a mess right now he‚Äôs right. I‚Äôm not ready for a relationship‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but I think that just made me feel worse because I was lying to him lying to myself. I did things I now regret like whatever it‚Äôs fine I liked him, but I just feel used . He said from the beginning he wanted causal but then he knew about my SA trauma . He knew n he I guess assumed it‚Äôd be okay cuz I‚Äôm ‚Äúslutty‚Äù. Then I guess later felt bad about it. Whatever.

    Anyway, I can‚Äôt seem to see sexual normally so I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúhooking up‚Äù especially casually is a very good idea. Like I have triggers and literally any mention of sex I just think of my SA. It‚Äôs the only reference I have unfortunately‚Ä¶..

  It helped a bit like I said but it definitely didn‚Äôt like get rid of the pain I‚Äôm feeling. It just made it worse because now I just did these things to make myself like feel anything else and to lower the value of what was stolen from me‚Ä¶.

  He didn‚Äôt exactly take my virginity . He ‚Äújust‚Äù SA me over my clothes, so I feel dramatic being this upset about it, but the way I see it that was my first experience. No he didn‚Äôt take that he didn‚Äôt have actual like PIV sex with me, but my first experience was literally assault and traumatizing. 

  I‚Äôm just not okay right now. And I‚Äôm realizing I became like attached to my rapist after I even kept dating him, because idk I thought it was my fault for not being ready. For not meeting his needs‚Ä¶. 

  Help. I feel so crazy like why is this so traumatizing ? Will I ever feel better and heal from this ? 

  I feel guilty too even wanting a normal sex life after that even wanting something that was so traumatic for me that was so disgustingly like‚Ä¶. forced so now I feel guilty that I‚Äôm even curious to know what normal sex is like.

  I‚Äôm just so depressed. How do I heal from this? And please don‚Äôt tell me to get therapy . I can‚Äôt get therapy yet.

"  Is this normal?    So I realized during the SA I thought such weird things‚Ä¶.. I thought it sounded ‚Äúhot‚Äù, but before that I just felt scared and confused and humiliated you know cuz it was my first time and I wasn‚Äôt at all ready‚Ä¶.. he forced me. So I was just having a hard time even accepting what was happening.

  So I started lying to myself I told myself he‚Äôs being rough and that‚Äôs hot I‚Äôve decided not humiliating not disturbing and so I focused on that . And then that didn‚Äôt help because then I felt like a slut.

  When I told my therapist she just judged me then basically asked if i enjoyed it n I clearly didn‚Äôt . I tried to tell her he was too rough and being an inexperienced like terrified virgin I didn‚Äôt know how to cope at all with it. Of course I went into denial play I disassociated
‚Ä¶..

  But maybe the truth is it was confusing because it still sounded I hate admitting this like ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so fucking embarrassing too like I swear to god if not for hookup culture I would‚Äôve told people my boyfriend SA me. Instead I just felt humiliated that I hadn‚Äôt done it yet and that I wasn‚Äôt ready. 

  I basically blamed myself for not putting out n I thought so will everyone else.  I thought I‚Äôm here with him in his room alone I knew how it looked. I knew people would judge me and I was right some of them did (but fuck them).

    Anyway‚Ä¶.. I didn‚Äôt know wtf was going on and I dissociated really badly and so I kept just like idk I had this expectation that when I‚Äôd do it, I‚Äôd be ready. I never thought he‚Äôd just make me. So I told myself weird things when I disassociated like ‚Äúthis is rough sex‚Äù ‚Äúthis sounds hot ‚Äú ‚Äúat least he‚Äôs enjoying this‚Äù and other weird conflicting things because idk I just couldn‚Äôt tell myself what was really happening.

" My first sexual experience was SA and it‚Äôs ruined me‚Ä¶.     My Story 

  This guy I had only been on a couple dates with‚Ä¶.  This was the third date, but we had talked on the phone that‚Äôs it though 3 months. I told him I never did anything sexually I‚Äôm a virgin basically a ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù for lack of better words.  And I was raised like that sex should be if I‚Äôm in love or preferably I should be married. At least I should know the guy really well. Besides that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with sex. I wasn‚Äôt taught much about it. I was taught it was bad pretty much and I didn‚Äôt know it was even normal for women to have urges ? So you get how I felt about it mentally emotionally. Though I did think from the beginning wow I feel like eventually I will have to because he was pressuring me, but too subtly for me to think much of it‚Ä¶.. but whenever he brought it up I got uncomfortable (like our second date and he said I‚Äôd never pressure you or anything and you wouldn‚Äôt do it out of guilt right? Then he just said hey I really like you‚Ä¶. Anyway I only knew him in person for three days before he sexually assaulted me. It was our first day literally first day of dating. 

    So here‚Äôs what happened‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ we were in his car as he pulled into the driveway to his house. I kept saying I‚Äôm looking for somewhere to go and he just ignored me. He suggested we go back inside his house and ‚Äúhang out‚Äù. Stupidly I believed him. He also casually says ‚Äúoh hey my Uncles here‚Äù. 

    I don‚Äôt go inside at first but eventually I do and thinking we‚Äôre gonna hang out. So at first we were just kissing ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. but then he started I guess grinding on me ? I didn‚Äôt know what it was even called at the time or I might‚Äôve just left, but I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time and he seemed nice enough. And I got really nervous. I said I had to go to the bathroom then went back like nah he doesn‚Äôt realize so I just have to tell him. So I tell him I‚Äôm really nervous I need to breathe. I do want to kiss you though.

  So he goes back to kissing me but how he‚Äôs doing it is more‚Ä¶. Intense so I have a panic attack . Eventually he pulled away and just went and sat on the other side of his bed ignoring me.

   He just completely ignored me he wouldn‚Äôt even look at me. I kept trying to tell him I was nervous again like I said. He sighs really loudly and like an idiot I ask what ? What‚Äôs wrong ? Then he doesn‚Äôt say anything again and just sighs irritated. Nervously I ask ‚Äúwhat ? What do you want ? He then gets in my face and says I WANT you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. (Empasizing the want) Then whispers to stop in MY EAR and goes back to kissing me even though I wasn‚Äôt and gets ontop of me again trying to kiss my neck.

  His Uncle walks in and asks if I‚Äôm okay because we‚Äôre kissing but he‚Äôs touching me groping me actually grabbing my boobs my ass and I‚Äôm literally doing nothing back but kissing him. I‚Äôm embarrassed and my face is getting red cuz I feel embarrassed about that so I say I‚Äôm okay and then he leaves and talks to his uncle‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

  Then he comes back and says ‚ÄúNow‚Ä¶.. where were we ?‚Äù And I don‚Äôt like how he says it but I feel insecure and I keep thinking maybe I should just touch him back like he wants even though it‚Äôs because he said he wanted me to stop sarcastically and even threateningly so at first I do. 

  Then he tries grinding on me again and I completely pull away and stop kissing him I stop like everything. I‚Äôm just looking down at what he tried to do again and I‚Äôm in shock. I wanted to say something but the way he said ‚Äú stop ‚Äú was so aggressive and it made me feel guilty and afraid, but again I just kept telling myself it‚Äôs fine I‚Äôm overthinking it he‚Äôs nice. 

  Then he looks down also looks at me sighs and then grabs me and kisses me I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt really think I need to scream and I‚Äôm getting afraid cuz I‚Äôm not grabbing him back, but either way he‚Äôs kissing me so aggressively not moving away from my face that I do back just because he‚Äôs freaking me out and I don‚Äôt want to offend him. So I think maybe if I don‚Äôt put my hands on him. So I don‚Äôt . The weird thing is idk maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it but he had grabbed and just kissed me before too and in his room, so why would I think the situation would get dangerous? 

  Then he just gets on my legs with his knees and I can‚Äôt move. We still have our clothes on. He just literally sits on my legs with his knees and I can‚Äôt move. I think does he realize he‚Äôs crushing my legs. I wanna scream but I just freeze. I can‚Äôt move.  I don‚Äôt care what anyone says idk how to describe it but simulating ‚Äúrough sex‚Äù except I didn‚Äôt consent so it simulated something different almost for me that seems more accurate than saying it was dry humping because that‚Äôs when two people are doing it. This was not that. To me it was just violating and abuse. I mean I couldn‚Äôt move I didn‚Äôt move once. 

  At all. 

    Then he proceeds to aggressively hump me until he finishes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ all while I can not move (tonic immobility) like freezing in fear cuz of him getting on my legs and I dissacociated‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but it was HOW he did it he seemed mad at me and he was aggressive. And it was kind of roughly‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. how he did it though thankfully wasn‚Äôt injured not to that point. He made me feel his groin area‚Ä¶.. many times‚Ä¶. Through the clothing. He forced my body to react then just finished‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. But after a long ass time n mind you I was HELD DOWN during this. He even TOOK BREAKS. And he kept getting ontop of me while he did this. It was terrifying I tried like if I just look away never look at him maybe he‚Äôll stop. He didn‚Äôt.  Even though it was aggressive dry humping I mean I was dissacociated and I froze and it sounded wrong so to be completely honest to ME from MY perspective at first I thought ‚Äú oh god it sounds like I‚Äôm being raped‚Äù and it did because he was roughly doing it without my consent and it didn‚Äôt sound right. It literally sounded forced, but my mind just went somewhere else though I partly had awareness of what was going on. And it took time to even figure out what was going on because I had never done anything at all sexually, so I was really scared. Emotionally though I just felt dead inside: empty. I felt like a fucking toy and he was using my body to‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ you know. And I was just there frozen unable to move. :( 

  I know he didn‚Äôt rape me or anything n I‚Äôm grateful it was at least over our clothes but here‚Äôs the thing : I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING I HAD NO SEXUAL EXPERIENCE  and I‚ÄôM A VIRGIN so to me it was horrifyingly close to something else or am I being dramatic ? I know it‚Äôs not even actual sex. I‚Äôm traumatized though. It still gave me PTSD.  And some fucking weird kinks and affected my sexuality amongst other issues‚Ä¶.. .-.

  I should mention honestly I wasn‚Äôt ready at all. I could see myself having been ready like 20‚Äôs like early 20‚Äôs . I was 19 at the time. It really hurts this being my first experience. Plus it makes dating just a nightmare. Especially being a bit promiscuous after this for a while just to make myself feel better like the more experienced I am, the less this matters. That isn‚Äôt helping though so now I just probably need therapy first before I do anything related cuz it just reminds me of my assault‚Ä¶..",ptsd
"Urges to bite others out of anger normal?  TW: Just to preface I‚Äôve grown up in an extremely emotional volatile household. My mother has borderline personality disorder and father exhibits all narcissistic personality disorder traits but does not have an official diagnosis. I personally have ADHD, PMDD, GA, and some C-PTSD. I often get extremely triggered by my parents and have a hard time calming my emotions and urges. 

Recently (like within the past few years) I‚Äôve started realizing how much my parents manipulate and use me in their wars against each other or for their favor. Safe to say I‚Äôve started resenting them heavily for it as my reliance on them has decreased. I‚Äôve started fighting back a lot.

A terrifying urge I‚Äôve developed when frustrated is to bite them. Like sink my teeth into them to get them to shut up? I‚Äôve never done it and don‚Äôt plan to but when I start seeing red it becomes really hard to control. It‚Äôs kind of insane and I‚Äôm terrified and grossed out by this but genuinely thinking it‚Äôs a trauma response.

But I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm wrong and it might be a precursor to abuse or my propensity to want to abuse others if I get angry at them but don‚Äôt know if this is just standard reactionary abuse behavior. 

I also worry (as insane as it sounds) that it might have something to do with cannibalism? I‚Äôve always liked biting people I love gently but sometimes it‚Äôs gotten a little intense but never to the point where I‚Äôve hurt them. 

I‚Äôm afraid my therapist might put me in an institute or something but know I need to tell her eventually but in the meantime what the hell am I supposed to do? Any good articles or research?

It's embarrassing and disorienting when I'm in public/school. It upsets other people too. Does anyonehave tips for sustaining calmness? I guess that's the opposite of this disorder. How do I heal? I'm so frustrated, it really feels like an involuntary part of myself. The twitching, the jumping and constant feel. It's like my reptile brain has taken over the rest of my brain.",ptsd
"I have certain trauma with orthodontic fittings. In middle school, a band of cronies restrained me. The leader fixed my palate guard too tightly. He struck me, making that guard shatter the roof of my mouth. Matter dripped out of the resulting hole. I spat some out. He wanted control over me in that he could hold my mouth's inside to dull my intelligence whenever he wished. He relished in having that kind of control over me. He told me to not look in a mirror. I was too damn scared to disobey. I had become used to obeying people out of fear.

Later on, an art teacher made me put a palate guard on. He fixed it on too tight. He concussed me by hitting me with a chair. I was broken. I lost consciousness a few days later. I was carted to the ER. I wasn't the same afterwards, or so I had been told. The aunt tried to prevent surgery. I had a plate installed unbeknownst to me. I forgot what had happened. I was too afraid to even broach the subject before. I was afraid to tell the principal that I wanted him fired. I was afraid he would come back for revenge, to finish the job. That art teacher was overly eager to beat up a fourteen-year-old. He was overly eager to damage him.

"Is this part of PTSD or is this my introvert ism?  I had a wonderful time having lunch with a friend today. We laughed (which is a big deal when in recovery) and had pretty good conversation for about an hour. When I came home, I was absolutely exhausted and could barely peel myself off the couch for hours. 

This isn't a once off. It happens every time I'm social and it doesn't seem to matter who I'm with or if it was enjoyable or not. 

For reference, my PTSD comes from several traumatic calls I attended as a paramedic over a 10 year period. I have always been on the introverted side of things, but I don't ever remember this kind of Fatigue after socializing.

"tw: molested by cousin growing up Hi I just wanted advice as I have no one to talk about this with. I‚Äôm 24(M) I have OCD and assume I have some PTSD. When I was maybe between 6-8, I remember my older cousin doing sexual things with me and my other cousin who was a year younger than me. She is 6 years older than me so a teenager at the time and she would dry hump with us when we were alone. I always was aware of this happening(I might‚Äôve forgot years after it happened) and I sort of just ignored it or maybe tried to cope with it by thinkin it was just a really weird thing that happened but I guess I‚Äôm my head somewhat consensual. This was my earliest memory of knowing what sex was. This ended up with me growing up with a rather bad relationship with sex not to mention I‚Äôve had OCD since a child and only recently found out. Sexual OCD is probably the hardest ocd type for me to deal with. I just don‚Äôt know what to feel. I actually got close with her as an adult but I just feel super weird now bein a lot more conscious about this. My biggest struggle in life is OCD so most of my trauma feels tied to that but I never really considered how much of an impact this had on me cuz I just didn‚Äôt want to think abt it. I think another bad part abt this is the fact that me and my cousin who i mentioned before did actually end up doin inappropriate things wit each other and actually got caught kissing once, the most awful part I hate is the fact that after this there was a time with my other younger cousin where I pulled their pants down and told my uncle and I got screamed at of course rightfully so, pulling their pants down was all that happened and I always get scared thinkin abt what if things would‚Äôve gone further. It‚Äôs so gross and I‚Äôve honestly lived with so much guilt from this. Im positive my family doesn‚Äôt even know that my older cousin was the one that introduced these behaviors to me and my younger cousin. Just feel uneasy abt this don‚Äôt even feel super scared cuz I worked thru so much of my anxiety living with OCD but I just feel super queasy and numb right now.",ptsd
"Will it be this bad forever? I won't go into detail. Short version is I had a very traumatic childhood and an extremely abusive mother.

"Questioning CW TW 


I was diagnosed with ptsd when I was 14, I am now 21 and I sometimes question whether I have ptsd or not. My partner says he can see how it affects me, but I don't. I also like, dissociate constantly tho. I always tell myself things weren't that bad how could I possibly have ptsd? From repeated SA, to surviving shootings, to being forced to smoke meth at 10 with my dad, watching my mom overdose while i try to feed her tomato soup bc i didnt understand she was dead, to being beat, to being homeless and abandoned at 11 y/o, to being neglected so bad my siblings and I had to eat the lice from each other's hair to survive. I just feel numb? I don't cry about it, I don't think about it. I guess I just shove it all away, and drink myself to death. Is that  normal? Am I actually not as traumatized as I think I am?

I know there will be parts of PTSD that I can't change and that I'm on a high right now and there will be low parts in the future, a lot of fear is still there, but its kinda of like I blame myself less? It feels more manageable with less self hatred. I can progress because everything isn't just in my head, it was real, and now I have a choice to live on. Hope? Maybe, more ""Contentness"".",ptsd

"I was 5 years old when I made my first drug deal.  My parents were fucking crazy. My mom used to put weed or meth in a cigarette carton, then would send me as her little messenger (even in snow storms) to these 2 scary people in my neighborhood. 

Her best friend was a drug dealer. His daughter was my age, and they forced us to be friends from kindergarten on. My mom never listened to me and made me go with him for carpooling. I would get sick and puke in his car because the smell was so bad and I would be so scared that it came out physically. At their house, it was in middle of no where in the woods, so big, an intercom and cameras everywhere, he apparently worked at a tile business but was NEVER at work, he always had robberies, family members would randomly die, scary people would show up at their house coming and going all day, he would drive us to random towns for meals to meet people. He was arrested by the time we were seniors in high school. He wrote my mom, and he was released right before I went NC. She picked me up at train station, and started taking me to his house. She was laughing as I cried and begged not to take me near him. 

Then that last xmas with my mom, my 3 brothers ditched me and went to our other side of the family party so I was stuck with her. She drove me to an abandoned apartment complex, took me in an abandoned apartment trap house with 2 creepy guys, and started snorting stuff in front of me while they asked if I wanted any. WHAT. 

I just dont get why these people would put me in harms way so much. Even my grandfather was a creep, like would put his arm around my moms waist and stuff and touch her. A classic narc, very wealthy and powerful. He used to tickle my 3 brothers, and they HATED IT. They would beg my dad not to let my grandfather do that to them, but my dad was too intimidated by him to protect my brothers.

So, the last time I saw my mom she dropped me off at train station. 7 min away. She told my brothers laughing, and told me to scare me that shes taking me 1 hour away to a dangerous area of the city to figure it out with the ""bad guys."" Just to see me scared. Its sick. They are sadistic fucks.

"Does anyone else find themselves cutting off friends more frequently than before? This has happened to me like... 5 times in the past 2 years.

"Medical trauma I've had such a year, at the start of this year is suddenly got very I'll, got a dangerous infection, almost sepsis.

I ended up needing emergency surgery and got taken to the hospital in an ambulance. 

Ever since I've been having nightmares and constant fear of anything medical. Ambulances, hospitals, doctors. It all makes me incredibly panic and anxious.

Got diagnosed with generalized anxiety, started on sertaline. Best my local doctor could do, she isn't allowed to diagnose any other illness, and it's a multi year wait for a psychiatrist here.

But I'm still struggling hard, especially since tons of surgical complications lead to another surgery last month, so its like it's fresh in my mind still.

"will I ever be me again Hey so I got out of this relationship with this guy about a year ago. He was incredibly mean to me, especially towards the end. In the beginning it was just small comments. And I trusted him so I let it go. And then they got bigger and he got meaner. Eventually I was convinced nobody would ever want me so I stayed. Once we ended, he was so mean and just tore me apart. Paragraphs about how I was ugly, nobody would ever love me, he never loved me, ect. It got so bad that my parents were going to put a restraining order on him.

It‚Äôs been about a year and a half and im still not the same. I am trying to get myself back but it feels kind of impossible.

I miss not feeling like a nuisance to everyone around me, I miss being able to talk things out with people without fear of them being mad, I miss liking myself and how I looked. I am so tired of this ruining my relationships with friends and potential relationships with guys as well. (Just fucked up a talking stage with this guy I REALLY liked because I was scared to talk things out). I miss the passion that I used to have for things. I used to be so passionate about my writing and crocheting and my style and the people around me and now im just kind of here. I was so so special. Just a ray of sunshine and laughter and I made everyone around me feel so happy and special.

And now im such a shell of myself. I still like crocheting and dressing up and everything but i am not as passionate about it. I am no longer kind. I am so mean to people for no reason. I am in therapy, on medication, I go for walks, I journal, but it feels like I‚Äôll just never be me again. I have goals. I work towards them and I am trying to better myself because yes, he did fuck me up but it‚Äôs my choice to either stay that way or get better.

Im not mad at him anymore. It‚Äôs not productive. And i understand him. I understand why he does those things. I understand why he‚Äôs so mean. I just wish I got away sooner. I wish this wasn‚Äôt my first relationship.

"Still feel bothered after blocking someone who use to abuse me in high school #

# 

I was bullied pretty badly in high school and faced racism. Anything from being addressed as the n word to being picked up and slammed to the ground while a friend of the main bully recorded me.

I‚Äôve gotten a black eye from him even and nearly went blind. He faced no consequences as he was a master manipulator and people like him for being the high school ""Jock‚Äù.

He always said sorry then repeated the behaviour and laughed with his buddies about it. He even made fun of my heritage (where my parents are from in Africa).

I get an apology about two years after high school and it (in my opinion) looked like an apology for himself. Sure, he said he‚Äôs sorry (he‚Äôs said it so many times it doesn‚Äôt hold value) and was more focused on saying in his apology ""I understand you probably hate my guts"".

I accepted the apology because my dad told me to.

Since then, I‚Äôve been through addiction & other not-so-proud stuff I‚Äôm not interested in sharing here. I decided to message him after all these years (been about 10 now) and it was a friendly message. Leaning towards me calling him a lovely person and how I understand if he still feels bad for what he did to me and said I understand the message could go unseen but I just wanted to share.

He, yet again, said he feels bad about how he treated me and said I look like I‚Äôm doing well and he‚Äôs happy specifically for that.

I just asked him why he called me the n word all the time and would beat me up over it. I asked if he found racism funny at the time. He denied absolutely everything he did. I then sent him screenshots of how he use to speak to me and he said ""Man, I don‚Äôt remember saying that, clearly I did though, there‚Äôs no denying that photo. I honestly don‚Äôt remember using that word with you or others. No one deserves that"".

For the sake of convenience of this post I‚Äôll make it short. We went back and forth over it and he accused me of spreading rumours about him over the last two years that he r\*\*\*d his ex and said how I can‚Äôt deny that as he has these messages pinned to my IP address.

I blocked him and unblocked him after an hour saying how crazy that sounds and specifically said the last time we spoke was in 2018/19 when he messaged me out of the blue. I then tell him if he has all that info, what does he plan on doing with it? And said intimidation and what he claims to be true do constitute grounds for legal action and said we can take this to court.

He says ""James, for the hundredth time, I‚Äôm done with these conversations. Chao for now"".

I said ""for the record, I hope those things are not true Chris, I just can‚Äôt connect the dots on why you think it‚Äôs me who did that. Chao"".

After a few days, I blocked him for good.

"I was assaulted by another woman and now I don‚Äôt know what to do I was sexually assaulted by a woman a few weeks ago.

We had casually hooked up a few times, not really knowing each other in a sober context, mostly just meeting up at college parties and making out, etc. One day she encouraged me to get high and then asked to go back to my room place. When we did she raped me.

I was so high that I barely knew what was happening. I had initially consented to kissing and above the waist stuff. But she quickly grew more aggressive and it progressed to more- both her touching me between the legs and using my hand to pleasure herself. I‚Äôve been sexually assaulted before (by a man) so I just froze, I couldn‚Äôt move. When I finally came to my senses I tried to push her off of me and told her that I needed a break/to text my roommate/find my phone. I kept repeating myself but she refused to stop. 

I finally pushed myself up and tried to get out from under her, but she pinned her legs around me and forced me back down. I told her no, but she didn‚Äôt listen and kept going. The next day my arm was sprained from being held down with it pinned behind my back. I also had visible hickeys on my neck, which made it even more triggering.

When I finally got her out of my room after physically forcing her off of me (she kept saying ten more minutes and continuing to make out with and touch me despite my protests. I had eventually just surrendered and lay passively while she did what she wanted) I felt nothing.

I washed my face and immediately went to bed, feeling uncomfortable, used, and terrified. I didn‚Äôt know what had happened, or if that was normal for sex. I‚Äôve never had sex with a woman before so I didn‚Äôt know.

The worst part is I continued to see this girl for over a month before finally cutting things off yesterday. After this incident I‚Äôd still go out with her, even though she regularly ghosted me on planned dates, blew me off, and objectified me in front of other people, treating me like arm candy and talking about me in overly sexual ways in front of people I barely knew. She also always found ways to turn our planned sober ‚Äúdates‚Äù into affairs where both of us were drunk and/or high, and when this happened she was always aggressively physical with me (even though I had said I‚Äôm uncomfortable with PDA) in public spaces, pinning me up against walls/tables and making out with me roughly. 

My friends noticed this and were always uncomfortable by it, and said they were worried for my safety. I brushed it off and made excuses, and kept seeing her.

The day after the assault my roommate made a joke about my hickey, saying something about how it looked like I‚Äôd had a fun night. I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I didn‚Äôt know what I was supposed to do, or what had even happened.

I still feel like it was my fault. I put myself in that situation, saw the red flags and kept telling myself it was okay. Every time she did something cruel or inappropriate she would say I deserved better and apologized. I always told her it was okay, and I put up with all of it.

Finally I cut it off, after she told me she didn‚Äôt have the time to commit to our relationship and wasn‚Äôt going to be available much. I called it quits and told her we were done. She almost cried, for some reason, even though she had practically initiated the split. Mind you, we were never officially ‚Äútogether‚Äù, just seeing each other for around two months. 

I‚Äôm just now processing the assault after we‚Äôve broken up. I‚Äôd rewritten in my head to be just a bad sexual experience. I‚Äôve even lied about it to my friends about it being enjoyable, just rough. I‚Äôm having a really rough time coming to terms with it, and I think I‚Äôm finally feeling the effects of the trauma in full force.

If anyone else has had experience with female on female assault, please let me know any advice you have. I don‚Äôt know if I can continue to even say I‚Äôm a lesbian, as the word leaves a bad taste in mouth now. I don‚Äôt know how I can continue to date women. Anything having to do with sex just feels raw and wrong and violating. I don‚Äôt understand how people can enjoy it. I walked away from my first sexual encounter wondering if I was actually asexual because of how horrific it had been. I feel like a fraud even calling myself a lesbian anymore.

trigger warning: mentions of childhood rape.

My boyfriend has a porn addiction and we addressed like three times that it‚Äôs cheating but he kept hiding and lying over and over. Then he said it gave him more pleasure than me and that they were better. He said he takes it all back and didn‚Äôt mean any of it and won‚Äôt do it again. 

That really messed with me, this happened maybe a month or so ago and I have been just as repulsed from sex, masturbation and ANYTHING inherently sexual. it makes me feel sick to think about. My boyfriend said it‚Äôs okay and to take my time and that he‚Äôs willing to do anything he can to help. I am trusting that he‚Äôs genuinely putting in effort to stop this addiction and I appreciate it of course, but my body and mind can‚Äôt let go of what he did and said I guess.?

I think it‚Äôs also hard, since I‚Äôm feeling repulsed from it, it makes me think of more bad things that have happened in my life having to do with sex.

the two main bad things I think of on top of what my boyfriend did are:

1. being raped as a child repeatedly by my stepdad

2. my boyfriend being too friendly with his female friends, watching fifty shades of gray alone with them, letting his female friends show him her dildo, etc.

It feels sickening that I let all this happen. It feels like there‚Äôs something wrong with me. my boyfriend hasn‚Äôt done anything with his lady friends in a while because he currently has none and doesn‚Äôt want to pursue a friendship with ladies. he likes his male friends and it also makes me more comfortable him having just male friends so it really does work out.

I just felt the need to explain all of this and put it all out on the table so somebody can give any advice or any kind words. I know I need a therapist but if there‚Äôs anything else I can do currently, I would appreciate the advice.

"Being friends with the person who traumatized you Hey folks. Warning for potential violence and potential murder, it's not quite abuse so I'm not adding that tag. 

The experiences that gave me PTSD were caused by one of my best friends who had PTSD themself, we lived together and due to certain circumstances I will not be discussing here, they were being triggered near-constantly. Their flashbacks were so bad that they would regularly forget who I was and would respond to certain situations violently, or sometimes they would get quiet and I would learn later that they were struggling not to attack me. I lived with them for about a month, and throughout that time I was never hurt, mostly through luck, coincidence, and a locked door.

That being said, it's been two years since I left. Unkind words were given on their part, I think because I was a constant in their life up until that point. But a few months ago, they reached out to me because of a personal situation that I could've had a stake in (I didn't) and we wound up talking about everything that happened. They were generally apologetic, and somehow we wound up saying that we would give friendship another try. 

We mostly just play games together once a week, and discuss those games. We've strayed into serious conversations a few times, but I've put my foot down once or twice when we got too personal because we aren't close like that anymore. The thing is, though, I've been wondering lately whether talking again is even healthy?

It's complicated for me, because they used to be the person I looked up to the most, my best friend, the person I told everything to. Now I don't even tell them what I do for work and whether or not I'm in school. We just dance around everything that happened like it was an awkward moment for both of us. I enjoy talking to this person, I really do, but I don't know if it's going to hinder my recovery or not. My flashbacks were less frequent at first, and then they went back to their pre-reconciliation levels. They're not as upsetting anymore, but the distress has been replaced with confusion and frustration. My mood has also been more stable (I'm also bipolar). 

I don't think that they handled the situation well, really, but I also think that it's been two years and they know better now. Not perfectly well, but better. And I'm not going to ever see them in person again, I don't think, so they're never going to be in a position again where they could reasonably hurt me.

So, my question is, can this be healthy, considering all of the checks I've put on the relationship? Everyone around me is telling me that I'm making a mistake, but I care a lot about this person. A lot. They got me through some tough times, and I got them through some as well. I just don't know anymore. In any manner, thank you for reading. It means a lot.

"Just got a completely random PTSD diagnosis, don't really know what happens next.  Hi, I've never been here before, but I suppose it's the proper place on the internet to post. Posting on alt account for privacy. \*\*This became a little long, I'm sorry\*\*

I've went through a pretty extensive psychological examination the last few months, with the initial goal just to go through ADHD, but we've went through a ton. I never thought I had PTSD or something like that, I never experienced flashbacks, any super triggering moments that that made me angry or something else, never happened. I'm also like the least agressive teddy bear there exists I think.

Never really crossed my mind. But I did relate to a lot of things on the, whatever the English word, the tests you fill in, around Trauma and PTSD. But afterwards it sort of felt like an insult to people with ""actual PTSD"", that I had any thoughts surrounding that.

We had gone over things like my SA as a boy, abusive households, suicidality, amongst some other things that felt like they might be relevant in evaluating my mental health. The psychologist I talked to was absolutely amazing.

I told him about one thing that I didn't have an answer to, where most of my ""inner self"", I feel I am relatively aware of, but this was one thing I didn't understand, and never had.

I've had a ""bad feeling"", as I've started to call it, in giving up for searching for words like ""anxiety"", or whatever this ""bad feeling"", could be, since I've been around 11/12, I'm 25 now. This feeling is constant, I'm having it writing this, and everything I do, since then, aside from when I'm using drugs like benzos, or had in the past. Zopiclone managed to do that for me too somehow.

It was the only time, quite literally ever, where I felt at peace, I could relax, enjoy a  movie, or have a meal. Alcohol abuse was a thing too, but was far far less effective for the ""bad feeling"". It worked decently well for social anxiety though.

It felt far fetched that I had something like anxiety (literally) 24/7, regardless of situation. Whether I'm in love with a girl I'm dating with all the positive hormones through the roof, or going through something tough, the feeling always, always remains.

I've heard of anxiety to describe ""moments"", of anxiety, that it wasn't constant. Still don't know if it is anxiety. It's not like I think of something and it gives me this ""bad feeling"", it just always is there, where ever I go, it follows.

Paranoia, and feeling like everything is going to go to hell, regardless of what it is, or how trivial.

I seem to be physically unable to sleep like a normal human being, unless I'm on large dosages of medication. First time I ever slept since I was a child, like actually slept, was just an encounter with good, heavy sleep meds, which was relatively recent. Zopiclone only worked for a high. So I'm not on extreme insomnia at the very moment. Used to have constant nightmares, not as much anymore, but they come, and it's often repeated nightmares.

Terrible confidence in every aspect. The outside can tell me that I'm attractive or that I'm smart, it all goes away though. Everyone has an ulterior motive in my mind, they must not mean it. I'm in this weird zone where I both need validation for those types of things, and also get very little out of the validation. Feel like everyone is just out to get me, sort of thing, even when I can recognize myself that it's completely irrational. And the world is not a safe space to be in.

Super low baseline mood, never really happy, I have periods of full blown depressions once in a while. It's hard for me to find things fun or enjoyable.

I isolate myself completely, I dissociate from reality quite a bit.

I don't know, we went over a lot of my life.

I don't know how much of it is related to a PTSD diagnosis, or something else entirely, but it's there. Most of these did not exist before 11/12 y/o, but essentially all of it came after. Although some of it could just be a lot of other aspects.

My psychologist made the connection above, that my dumbass hadn't figured out, that the ""bad feeling"", amongst all else, coincidentally came after these childhood events. In a pretty focused time point. So we talked a lot about it. I asked him after all of it, what ""stood out"", he mentioned ADHD and things surrounding trauma. That these things were to persue all the way out. But PTSD, was still not on my mind. I was just like ""yeah I guess I might have a bit of a trauma issue perhaps"".

CURRENT TIMES YAY!

I go to finish an explanation of the results of a cognitive test I've made prior, and meet a different psychologist, not the dude I talked with. Turns out I get diagnosed with ADHD, and I'm not dumb (on paper) yay. Months work past me.

But, it was also, almost casually explained that I have a formal, real ass PTSD diagnosis. For whatever reason there was some miss match with a follow up for that, I suppose, and I got to hear that second-hand. And she was apologetic I remember. I look up my medical journal, and boom, a big ass, fat PTSD diagnosis up in there. She books me a time with a new psychologist for PTSD, the amazing guy is on family leave, yay.

This was a couple days ago, I'm now waiting for a follow up.

I still don't really know what the actual fuck this means. What the implications are, how this is going to impact my life, if some of these things can get better, what the treatments are, I have no clue.

So I guess after the wall of text, my question I suppose is if anyone here at all can relate to any of this, if there are people here not suffering through flashbacks or things of that nature. Maybe someone has something to share :) And also I suppose I'm writing because I can't really tell people in my surroundings about this, so this is what I've got at the moment. And I suppose I'm trying to conquer my undying shame, so saying these things ""out loud"", to people outside of just my psychologists, is news for me. Thank you. And sorry if it's too much.

"PTSD hallucinations and fears  Hi. So, I have PTSD, and I am autistic as well. My PTSD is rooted in safety and security fears.

Or, waking up looking at random shapes transforming into scary imagery (as if someone is surveilling me, in my case)?

"Physically assaulted at work then my abusive ex texted me something cruel just a few hours later. I just feel so awful and lost rn  I really need some support and kindness right now and I can‚Äôt seem to explain what I need from to loved ones. I‚Äôm also feeling like I‚Äôm overreacting to what happened to me 24 hours ago. 

I‚Äôm 99.99% sure these two events are unrelated but god does it sucks. 

To cut a long story short: one of my patients (old man, but strong as hell) at work punched me in the face so hard I fell. Other than a busted lip, some aches from points of impact from fist and the floor, I am physically ok. I could‚Äôve seriously been hurt but luckily I wasn‚Äôt wearing my glasses, and I was able to fall safely 

I go home early and can only manage 4 hours of sleep. I then have to drive a family friend in my car for an hour. Which is really hard for me because I have severe trauma from being abused by my ex and grandfather inside a car. People in my car is a huge trigger. 

Right before I drive this person though, my ex texts me something weird. I‚Äôve told my ex to NEVER contact me unless it was a family emergency of some type and I thought he understood this because I hadn‚Äôt heard from him in months. Anyways. It‚Äôs a screenshot of a tweet, obviously just like some harmless little meme and I would‚Äôve excused it as maybe an accidental message not meant for me until I read what it said. 

It said ‚Äúmurmuring ‚Äòok slay‚Äô as someone shows me how to use a can opener‚Äù 

For context, 8 years ago when I was 16 and dating him (we dated for 7 years, starting when I was 16) we were making dinner at my house. I had happened to have just never used a can opener before (weird, I know, but I was 16 and I didn‚Äôt really like canned foods so I never had to use one). 

So I turn to him and I ask, ‚Äúoh hey can you show me how to use this?‚Äù But for some reason this ANGERS him. He shuts down on me, tell me to ‚Äújust look it up‚Äù (in a mean tone) and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou seriously don‚Äôt know how to use a can opener‚Äù and all around, it was just a cruel experience. He never did show me and he ended up ignoring me from how angry and stupid he thought I was 

Anyways. That was not an ‚Äúok slay‚Äù moment for me. I just have. No. Idea. WHY. He would send me a joke like that? I‚Äôm so confused? 

Like I‚Äôm just so hurt right now. And I might‚Äôve brushed it off but like. I was violently attacked not even 12 hours prior to him texting me that out of the blue. 

And I‚Äôm just feeling so down on myself. I feel like I‚Äôm overreacting to everything that‚Äôs happened in the past 24 hours. Like I‚Äôm just being over dramatic and I should get over this but god it is so hard right now. My feelings hurt. My face hurts. I just want support and kind words right now and I feel like such crap for trying to ask my loved ones ‚Äúhey can you be extra nice to me right now? I was assaulted and then my ex texted me‚Äù. 

I already told them all these details and like, they were pretty nice to me but idk it didn‚Äôt feel like enough? I don‚Äôt want to sound like a weird bitch by specifically asking them to be extra comforting to me. Or maybe they just don‚Äôt really know what else to say to me.

"Hallucinations  Been a while since i've posted here, unfortunately I have a hard time explaining my symptoms.
I have only been getting these hallucinations as a symptom for about a year, I thought they would get better with time but they have only been more vivid and frequent as time passes, I was hoping for advice from someone who has also dealt with this symptom and what can be done to help myself when I start seeing things.
Tonight has been the most difficult instance of this I have ever had, I came home from work and immediately thought I saw someone in my house and I tried my best to brush it off as usual, however I couldn't shake the image I had seen and was very on edge. About an hour after this my wife asked if we could change our bedroom to another room and I said yes. We started pulling out the contents of the new bedroom so we could start putting our bed and other furniture in it. The the stuff we moved out of the room was put in the hallway ( we live in a trailer and there is only
one hallway ) I came to a scary realization that if someone broke in I would not be able to quickly get to the other end of my house where I store my gun to protect my wife and I.
I then thought I saw something move at the end of the hallway on that end of the house. I immediately started panicking and felt trapped which turned into a huge episode, it took my wife almost an hour to calm me down and assure me there was no one inside other than us...
This has only seemed to get worse and not better.
I used to only see things through my window or over my shoulder as I walked inside from my car.... Now I see things like this in my house all the time.

"I am in a cycle  I feel like I am going in a circle, every day is the same. When I am at home I mask my emotions and then at night I cry and barely sleep. When I go to the 18-21 program i either barely make through the day or have an episode, I feel bad and guilty for my teachers because they have to deal with me. Then at night i cry and don‚Äôt sleep. I am exhausted, I just want one good day or two hours in a good mood at school. I am going to talk to my therapist about this. But i feel so alone and exhausted. I just don‚Äôt know what my body wants!! I am scared that there be a point where my body will just shut down( if you know what i mean) sometimes i can‚Äôt see my therapist because of life things pop up in her life, i also don‚Äôt want to put more stuff on my teacher plate. I know it‚Äôs not good for me to surpress my emotions but i can‚Äôt help it. 
Thanks for listening!",ptsd

"Is memory suppression real? Hello I (f21) am diagnosis's with PTSD, specifically in response to an abusive romantic relationship. Ever since that event I have used and abused whatever I can to separate myself from reality. During my first hospitalization a few weeks ago, while unable to distract myself, I felt like it was the first time I could think clearly in years. Unfortunately it all came to an abrupt end when my mom called me and berated me for my decision to put myself into treatment. As a result I had one of the most extreme panic attacks of my life. A few hours later (following my parents demands) I lied to the nurses, told them I was over reacting, and left. Since this happened I have confided in friends about how hurtful this out of character reaction from my mother was. They surprisingly were not shocked and instead started to bring up instances of similar behavior. Personally, I have limited or even no recollection of most of the events they mentioned. After talking to them, a few nights later I just suddenly remembered a particularly painful (and in turn shocking) memory surrounding my parents. Admittedly it feels as though I cannot trust my own memory. My parents and I have had some very rough patches but I've always felt as though they had my best interests at heart. Could these be repressed memories? I feel like I could honestly be making this all up subconsciously because of what my friends have told me and my drug use. I have been wanting to talk to my parents about my substance use and desire for treatment and this whole internal conflict is preventing from doing so. ",ptsd
"Instincts are confused cant trust self/others I dont know what to think/do right now, not to mention I am doing emdr around ‚Äúi cant trust others‚Äù.

I am going on month 5 of light duty on L&i. My manager said when I saw her today after giving her the new apf ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how you are on light duty when there are other people in our department with worse injuries and they are working‚Äù. I responded by reiterating that with l&i claim if further injury were to occur the company would be liable but with fmla accommodations are allowed because held to different standard. She seemed annoyed at my response and said grievance of not having someone to cover my work with another going out for surgery next week. I decided to validate her feeling stressed by saying it sounds like it is stressful to figure out the coverage and I will be available to support the staff as the cover my workload as able. 
This is the second time she has mentioned this the first time I had a trauma response and my reaction was not based in reality but the past (i will link my response below). This time nothing is being triggered but it still feels like she should not be saying this to me and that it is inappropriate. I am unsure if her intentions are ha rmful on purpose or she is just stressed and taking it out on me and harmful without knowing. Am I overreacting/thinking about this and should I just let what has been said go or should I talk to union rep? I also feel conflicted to do this as I like my manager and she has never crossed my boundaries when speaking to me outside of L&i claim.

Post when told something similar and response differed (trauma triggered):
L&i triggered ptsd at work
I just completely dissociated at work and when coworker asked if okay i broke down crying. I used a photo of a good memory to bring me to an ok place now. I am currently on l&i and my manager was surprised my light duty was extended by doctor. I realized I dont know much about l&i and so I looked into it. I saw some lawyer sites where says its legal (even for state workers) to be tracked by private investigators if they believe you can go back to work or are per my employers words ‚Äúmilking it‚Äù(this was said about a past employee on l&i claim when talking about continuing on light duty). Anyway, I have ptsd and have been stalked and the possibility of being followed triggers this. I don‚Äôt know how to go forward as I know its unlikely this is happening to me but still triggered me. I don‚Äôt know what to do as never used l&i before and feel like it is causing ptsd to worsen with fear of being followed again.

Tldr: my manager is saying something that feels wrong and i dont know how to respond as I dont know if i am overreacting if i do address it",ptsd
"Will I ever actually get better? I can‚Äôt remember a time in my life where things were different. I was in dangerous situations from a young age, as I grew to a teenager, I put myself in a lot other dangerous situations with my temper and lack of control, and ego. 

I‚Äôve been in a lot of altercations. I‚Äôve been attacked many times, I‚Äôve attacked people many times in retaliation. I‚Äôve been jumped, beaten, kicked and stabbed at different times in my youth. 

I‚Äôve lived a beautiful life for the last 2 and a half years or so now. I survived. Today I feel like random people who I just met are untrustworthy or trying to take something from me. I don‚Äôt let anyone walk behind me (I‚Äôve been jumped from behind), I can‚Äôt trust anyone and I‚Äôm always in a state of tension and readiness. 

My mind has cleared up a lot, I‚Äôve talked thru a lot of the flashbacks and situations where me/people I love were almost killed. I‚Äôm very hopeful for the future and I live a good life, I cleaned up, got off drugs, went to college. I‚Äôm doing great. The faces of my old enemies began to not startle me anymore when I would see them in my head. 

But I can‚Äôt just relax. I‚Äôm lying in bed rn, and the last thought I had was about an older man I met for the first time today, he literally was so nice and we had a good conversation‚Ä¶ I was thinking about this as I lay down but then my head comes out with ‚Äúif he tries to fuck me over I‚Äôm gonna kill him‚Äù. 

For context, I‚Äôm a fit 19 year old man. He was far older and smaller than me. This thought made absolutely no sense. Why do I see innocent people as a threat? It‚Äôs not like I always see them this way but I can‚Äôt get the smoke to clear when the mood takes me. 

My brain just said ‚Äúwhy would this random man be nice to you‚Äù and it immediately became defensive. I come from a place where most people are extremely friendly unless you make enemies with them. It‚Äôs like I think everyone has an agenda, things they want that they‚Äôd be willing to fuck me over for. AND I KNOW ITS NOT TRUE

I KNOW ITS NOT TRUE. 

I have been shown so many times that it is not true. It makes me feel like I truly am mentally ill, I‚Äôve never known anything different. I‚Äôve always been an upbeat guy, laughing all the time. When I was a child, before things happened, I used to only ever laugh or cry, there was nothing in between. I was always an intense kid. So maybe that doesn‚Äôt help. 

I just want so badly to come home and actually believe that the fighting is over, but I‚Äôm so UP all the time. It takes so little to set me off but the thing is I don‚Äôt even realise I‚Äôm ‚Äúset off‚Äù. It‚Äôs just normal to me. And then I realise people are afraid of me, intimidated. Cos I‚Äôm in fight mode. 

Last night I couldn‚Äôt sleep, and I was sick for the whole day, my stomach was so weak and nervy. I felt cold. My body wouldn‚Äôt stop tho. Adrenaline kicked in at around 10am, just after I rested while on public transport for a while. 

God I don‚Äôt know. I just wanna come home. 

It hurts me so much that people I love are afraid of me when they feel the intensity. They don‚Äôt realise that in that moment I‚Äôm actually a lot more scared than they are‚Ä¶ and there‚Äôs no good reason why anymore, it‚Äôs been over for years, they‚Äôre not coming anymore. 

But I‚Äôm just scared. My body is scared. ",ptsd

"How to deal with guilt linked to PTSD ?  It‚Äôs my first time posting on reddit so I don‚Äôt really know what I am doing (also English is not my first language). I was diagnosed with PTSD a month ago and since then my feeling of guilt became more apparent. I struggle with feeling like I am being a nuisance for people close to me and the medical professionals I am seeing. I also feel like my past is ¬´¬†not bad enough¬†¬ª to deserve this diagnosis. I know this feeling is irrational because all the signs are there and I should not feel this guilt, but this feeling is really killing me and I don‚Äôt know how to fight it. I also know that this way of thinking is due to my upbringing. Most of the time I feel like a liar, as if i had an impostor syndrome. Does anyone feel the same ? Do you have advice to help alleviate this feeling ? Will it go away with time ? ",ptsd
"Struggling with being enraged to the state of violence after yet another man put his hands on me I've written about the details in another sub. 

I've got a pretty extensive history of DV, SA, rape, medical plus religious trauma. The list is ridiculous.

Despite that I managed over a decade of youth work, I'm ferocious about the protection of others.

I came unstuck when I asked for help for the first time in my life about 6 years ago. I wasn't helped. I was blamed, shunned, judged and revictimised and I fought back with everything I had because it's always been in my nature to do so. I have the same ferocity for myself.

I've proven that, I just find another gear and run on pure adrenaline until the danger is past and I can recover in private... till the next round.

I recently (3ish months ago) got sober after becoming unstuck from the lack of support I had 6 years ago. Obviously substances made things worse and I've taken full responsibility for the hurt I've caused other people because of that.

I'm still proccessing alot of horrific things that happened a year ago in therapy and I'm oscillating from rage to numbness constantly.

I was starting to feel some stirrings of sadness about the whole situation when a man put his hands on me completely unprovoked in a inappropriate way (not SA) at the end of last week.

Because of that it launched me into a fight type ptsd response. The kind where your so enraged you could kill someone (and I stress I wouldn't - they are thoughts).

I'm a woman and I'm feeling very unfeminine about having such violent reaction. I asked my therapist about if it's usually a male thing and they said ""usually.""

I think I'm feeling some shame about having had to become my own protector, others protector and I can't function normally anymore. I can't even hide the rage (I used to be able to hide anger)... this is different. It shows on my face and in my body language and I know it can scare some people because they don't know what's about to happen or if I'll lash out. It provokes anxiety and fear in other people and I never used to be like this. Alot more awful things happened to me in those 6 years and I'm... different again with the ptsd I have. It's like my nervous system and brain got rewired to fight mode when I was attempting to put the pieces of my life back together.

The worst thing I've done when I'm like this is break inanimate objects, throw things,, swear and slam doors. When I've calmed down enough I always apologise and mean it. I think it's because I no longer want to die so taking it all out on myself like I used to has caused the symptoms to flip into outward physical symptoms.

I'm so fucking angry with the person who has set off the last round of this inside of me. I'll let it go but I'm still recovering from the aftermath currently.

"my event happened 3 or 4 years ago (I'm not sure it doesn't feel that long ago) and my cousin decided to hang out with the person who caused my trauma my cousin knows what happened to me and decided to hang out at a Halloween party with the person who tried to k1ll me. I seen her yesterday at a family party for my sister and I couldn't even look at her without feeling sick, I really hate her for that and idk if I can forgive her and she was just acting like nothing happened and tried to be ""cool"" the whole time by hanging out with older ones. obviously I didn't say anything to her cause I don't think I'd even get the words out. I just wanted to smack her across the face and tell her to never speak to me again but instead I pretended she didn't exist and I'm not letting that stupid pick me bitch near me again. I think the reason why she was with that girl was bc she was trying to be cool or something because the one I hate was dressed like a s1ut and my little cousin seems to want to be around those people idk why, but I wouldn't have even known if other girls at the party hadn't texted me to tell me that the bitch was there and they didn't know who could have invited her other than my cousin so I don't want anything to do with her anymore and she's not allowed into my house if she's gonna start hanging with psychopaths.

"Do I have to experience flashbacks everyday? I'm sorry if this sounds disrespectful. I posted a similar question on r/mentalhealth because I'm still not diagnosed with anything specific but it got me nowhere, so I decided to ask here.
I don't have any specific diagnosis and I'm not trying to self diagnose myself. My therapist did say I'm ""traumatized"", referring to an event that happened 10 months ago, but nothing else. In my free time I did some research and I found out I relate to almost all the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD (excluding nightmares): I experience them all: flashbacks, intrusive thoughts and memories... Just not every single day.
I have intrusive thoughts almost everyday and  full-on flashbacks roughly once every two weeks, but when they happen they're strong (I had to leave class once). It's like my brain is giving me mixed signals: some days it feels as if I'm perfectly fine, some days I get crushed by memories, and I don't know what to think of it. 
Again, I'm not trying to diagnose myself, it's up to my therapist decide what I should do,  I just want to know if it's normal. Thanks if you read til here!",ptsd
"Do you get triggered by general stress more easily than before? I was diagnosed with PTSD ~3 years ago and went to a trauma PHP this year. I don‚Äôt get triggered by my original trauma, but find myself getting triggered by other stressors in my life.

Example: currently having money issues and my car won‚Äôt start. Since finding out my body has gone into a fight/flight/freeze mode where my muscles are almost always flexed/tense, which were the symptoms I had in my PHP. This never happened prior to treatment.

"Can you develop PTSD from being physically ill? Hello, hope everyone is doing well. Sorry if this is against the rules or a stupid post, I will delete it if people want me to.

So I've had a look online at some information about PTSD or CPTSD and in some regards it seems like I might fit, but in other cases I'm not sure. For example, I've never suffered abuse or anything like that, my family are great. So I thought I might share my experience and see if anyone here can offer any advice, if that's okay.

When I was 13, I suddenly got really ill. I would feel like I was gonna be sick almost constantly, no matter what I was doing but I think it might've been worse when I ate. We had a lot of tests, for celiac disease and lactose intolerance, but couldn't figure out what was going on. I dunno how much I weighed but I wasn't eating and my weight dropped. Then after 2 months in December 2013 my appendix ruptured, so it looks like it was that all along.

Not long after that I started having trouble eating, like there was a mental block, it was really difficult every time I ate so I avoided it a lot. Then I started to have OCD symptoms like having routines about everything and obsessing about the possibility of being sick. Things got worse and worse until I had to go into the psychiatric ward in 2015. I was there for 3 months, and by the time I left the eating problems and the OCD seemed to have receded.

But after I left, I realised that I no longer seemed to feel emotions or enjoyment about anything. I don't know when it happened or how or why but at some point while I was at hospital I went from crying every day to now having not cried in over 9 years. I'm just numb all the time, I don't enjoy anything or have any interests or passions or anything. The OCD and eating problems have returned but in slightly different guises, along with depression, and nothing seems to help, not therapy (CBT, TherapyForYou, counselling, group OCD therapy, art psychotherapy and currently seeing a private therapist) or medication (Sertraline, Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Vortioxetine and probably others I've forgotten) or anything. I had EMDR but the lady ended up stopping it because it wasn't doing anything. So now I'm stuck, I have no energy or drive to do anything, even the stuff people suggest like exercise or trying new things. I've read about things like the freeze response and it seems to make sense but I don't know what to do about it. 

Sorry for the long post, I didn't know what was worth mentioning and what to omit",ptsd

"I asked my psychiatrist to put my ptsd and agoraphobia on my record and they just asked why? So there‚Äôs two reasons I want it official. 

One is because it can help me in my application for better housing as I‚Äôm not considered a priority as I don‚Äôt have any mental health issues as far as they‚Äôre aware. I wanted a letter written to show my problems and a diagnosis rather than word means a lot also.
It‚Äôll also help me claim disability benefits 

The second is simple. If I‚Äôm told I have it, put it on my record. It is my record and I want it to be as thorough as possible. It‚Äôs important information for professionals in the future or anyone who needs my records to know. 
Me not being able to go outside or socialise is very relevant. My ptsd effects me greatly on its own and also effects my agoraphobia along with my bpd 

But they just said ‚Äúis the bpd not enough‚Äù and I had to plead my case as to why I want it for an hour

I just feel like they‚Äôve shown how little they understand me and want what‚Äôs best for me


My ptsd is from an abusive relationship but also repetitive sexual trauma. I‚Äôm in a supported accommodation which means I feel unable to do simple things like put the bins out because there‚Äôs staff everywhere and other people walking around the building and one of my traumas is from supported accommodation too.

I get flashbacks, nightmares, panic attacks, I‚Äôm always on edge and uneasy but the main thing is how it effects all my other problems like agoraphobia and bpd.

"Anyone have advice for how to know if memories are real? Hi, I'm sorry if this is not the place for this, but I wasn't really sure where to go with this.

Basically, I have been diagnosed with DID, but the ""root"" of that, meaning the specific trauma that caused it has always been a bit unclear. When I was 8 I lived alone with my dad for a year, and all I know from that is that it wasn't good. I went to therapy when I was 11 and already then I couldn't remember the year with my dad. 

Now, I'm doing a lot better, I'm stable and pretty mentally healthy. I think that's why the lost year has suddenly kinda ""resurfaced"". I haven't been in touch with my dad in years, but wished him happy birthday a week or so ago, and since then things have kind of been chaotic. 

I want to remember what happened. After I moved away to stay with my mom, I was broken. Suicidal, depressed, I had daily panic attacks and nightmares most nights, and I was only 10. It's just not normal, and it makes me think something might have happened to make me that way.

I know he was verbally abusive, and I was neglected pretty bad that year, but that doesn't kinda seem extreme enough for how bad I got? 

There are also these snippets that make me worried I might have been assaulted, but I was 8 and its 20 years ago now, so how do I even trust whatever fragments I get ahold of?? How do I know what is a real memory, and what is just me projecting my worst fears? 

If anyone has been through something similar I would love some advice. Unfortunately going back to therapy isn't an option right now.",ptsd

My best friend lives in New York City, they offered to let me stay with them for a few months until I get on my feet. I just can't seem to do it. I have a job and am terrified that Ill just move there and drain all my savings. The job market is so rough right now I can't seem to land anything better than what I have in my hometown, I just don't know what to do. What if I fail and wind up broke and back where the trauma happened again? I don't feel like a person here, I feel like a shell. If I move out I want to be sure I never come back here again. It feels too risky but my episodes are getting worse here. And Tbh I am scared. ",ptsd
I had something happen to me 1 year ago and It hasn't gone out my mind  It starts off with me sitting in my house intill I get a call it was from a lad called Charlie he acted as my friend and stuff so he invited me to meet him I said sure them I met up with him when i got there he had some uver lad with him I didn't really worry about it at the time intill me and them was walking about they said let's go to somewhere quiet and they brought me to a field and next minute you know the lad starts pushing me and I thought it was a joke at first intill both off them started on me they beat me till I couldn't get back up they kicked me in the head 3 times punched me in the stumuck 4 times and broused every part off my body and left me there it tuck me 2 hours to walk home and when I got home the police never did enything and now Charlie still pushes me around alot and I can't stop seeing what happened in my sleep I really don't know what to do because it's just damaged me inside so bad that I can't hug enyone with out flinching or enything like that I really don't know what to do.,ptsd
"Why do so many interactions with my family feel incredibly fake  I‚Äôm 18 and there‚Äôs been a lot of times where I‚Äôve wondered if there‚Äôs something wrong with me that my family hasn‚Äôt told me about. There‚Äôs this intense air of walking on eggshells around me and concern in my families eyes. I feel like they explain things too much to me, explaining far more than I asked or using excessive detail when asking me to do something or when they are explaining really simple things as if it‚Äôs my first time doing that task or hearing about a simple concept. Using a fake high pitched voice to express concern drives me fucking MAD, they say they are trying to use a ‚Äúcalming‚Äù tone and it enrages me. I don‚Äôt need a calming tone or all this extra shit. I just want to be talked to like a normal person. I feel like they hold back their true selves and im being treated like I am mentally ill and It‚Äôs really tiring",ptsd
PTSD and gender dysphoria Trigger warning SA. When I was young I was raped by someone. As I've grown I've worked on it but my PTSD has come back. Something else that has been bothering me is feeling more uncomfortable in my skin and clothing and feeling like I belong in a body that is the other gender than what I was born as.

"I think my ptsd is ruining me About a week ago I went to check up on someone I was concerned with and found he committed suicide in his bedroom. He'd been in there for 3 days and you could tell. It was difficult to process, and I don't think I fully have yet.

Lately I've been getting extremely wasted and making a fool of myself in front of my friends and my girlfriend. When I start drinking it's not like I'm even thinking of what happened, I've just been subconsciously allowing myself to get smashed more. It doesn't help that my new antidepressants make things worse before they get better, and it's difficult to push through when what I saw keeps flashing in my head.

My friends have been expressing some concern for my mental health, and I honestly agree with them. I'm very much struggling, not just from that event but from a lot of difficult things in my life. I want to be a good boyfriend for my girl and a good role model for my family, but my mind is slipping.",ptsd
"Fear of being alone at night I live alone and I hate being alone at night. I have a significant other and spend the night with them 1-2 days a week but other than that I'm on my own with just my cats most nights. It was so bad that during the summer I would go to bed when it was still light out to avoid this, but since it gets dark so early now I can't do that any more. I'm not sure why. My trauma is not particularly related to the night time but something about it just scares me so, so much. When I leave my SO's house Ill sometimes end up distraught and crying at the thought of spending the night alone. Does anyone else experience this and has anything helped? Spending less nights alone is probably not an option right now, and I already have pets for company.",ptsd

"I hate when people use the terms PTSD/trauma colloquially I know I'm not supposed to assume that something wasn't traumatic for somebody. I know not to assume that somebody doesn't have PTSD just because they haven't told me they have it. I'm aware of Big T Little T trauma.  

But my goodness I cannot stand walking out of a test or a class and somebody laughingly joking, ""OChem is giving me PTSD."" ""I was traumatized by that exam."" Like sure yeah I'm sure that clinically you can be traumatized by academics but I feel like they very clearly mean it colloquially, and it just bothers me because I'm pedantic and want to say ""You weren't traumatized, you don't have PTSD, your life was never threatened and you don't live your current life avoiding specific sounds and scents because experience the wrong one and you get teleported back four years."" 

I know I can't stop the world and I know these terms are ingrained in casual society so complaining won't do anything, but sometimes it just ticks me off a lot. ",ptsd
"When you've hit rock bottom the only way to go is up First off CW for abuse, csa, hoarding, and ideation

This is my first time posting something like this on a reddit forum besides maybe some drawings on other forums. Reason why I'm here is for support and to connect with others who may have gone through similar.

Little bit of background I'm 21 and have delt with PTSD for as far back as middle school. I wasn't diagnosed until June of 2021 and have been struggling to figure out what this means for me since said diagnosis. One thing that you should know is I'm also AuDHD and have MDD for context.

To make things short, I came from a broken home, 3 siblings (C is currently 27yro, N is 24yro, I'm the 3rd born and my youngest sister Ce is 19yro as of writing) single mom who at the time I was born was divorcing my dad. My dad was abusive physically to my mom and had very untreated ADHD, his anger was out of control 99% of the time.
I was too young to witness any of it, once I was old enough to remember anything he was already kicked out and out of my life.
I was 5 when my moms new boyfriend moved in and later in life at 7-8 years old he would abuse me sexually, later found out all 4 of us kids were abused by him. He was also just a massive dickhead, who was (and I don't like using this word for this) a narcissist.
He started fights and loved to see and make my oldest sister who was severely autistic, extremely upset.
She would get so upset she would get into physical altercations with my mom almost on the daily and threaten her sisters including me that she would murder us in our sleep. We had to lock the knives away in a separate drawer.

Needless to say, little me didn't get much sleep at all as a kid. If I wasn't kept up by my sister and step dad having screaming matches, I was up awakened by panick attacks that my sister would one day come and kill us in our sleep. To this day I have insomnia because of high anxiety.

My paternal grandma was the only one who really took care of me. My mom wasn't in her right mind at the time of raising me and my grandma noticed at a young age I wasn't held as much as a mother should hold their infant. So my grandma held me many times I've had autistic meltdowns and my mom would disregard me as being difficult. My family never caught onto the fact I was AuDHD because in comparison to my high needs autistic sister, C, to them I was as neurotypical as they get. So I never got accommodations for my AuDHD.

The problem is my Grandma never really did anything to help with C's anger against my mom and step dad which would only end up in more arguments. My grandma meant a lot to me but by age 13 my mom had stopped taking us to our grandma's since she thought my grandma was only making things worse (and to an extent, she was).

Leaving the only person who ever treated me with kindness dispite my AuDHD was only further destruction to my development (hence the PTSD diagnosis).

January 11th 2019 was the day my step-dad got outted for sexually abusing all of us kids. My sister, N, came into my room crying because my oldest sister C had told her that my step dad had groped her the other night. I had to call my mom from work and all I remember was the sound of my mom wailing over the phone begging N to say she was lying.

We called the cops. They took my sisters reports. And I stayed silent. I stayed silent because being the ""trouble child"" in my family as well as undiagnosed untreated AuDHD it was easy to blame me for a lot of things and dismiss me for my feelings and concerns due to me being ""unruly"". I thought at the time they would dismiss my assault just the same as everything else I had concerns of throughout my life.

After that I knew no one was taking the grief well and neither was I. My family was just so angry at eachother blaming everyone for the fights the assaults, who deserved what more, who's fault it was, who caused it. Everyone was pointing fingers all at anyone but the man who assaulted us.
I was excluded by my sisters for being ""papa's favorite"" since to them ""I was never assaulted"". Mom detached from us kids because every one of my sisters were mad at her for bringing her boyfriend into our lives only to traumatize us. Everyone blamed eachother for grieving. Everyone blamed eachother for not listening to what the other has to say.

No one was getting anywhere.

I had known my mind was fucked up beyond imagination so I sought a counselor through my school who then refered me to a therapist office that provided my school services since my highschool was in a low income area of Seattle that had students who have been brought up in bad homes.

I started therapy sophomore year of highschool and was diagnosed with Post traumatic stress at 17.

I graduated during the pandemic, moved to Ellensburg WA to attend CWU for only 6 months before realizing I didn't have the funds to complete college. Then moved back home March of 2022

It was the hardest decision I've ever made. As I had promised myself I would never come back to my mom's house after graduating.

I got a summer job that paid well then worked as a receptionist at a clinic in Seattle in September 2022. Come October I would meet my first boyfriend...now ex.

My relationship with my bf (well call him Jackie) was a breathe of fresh air. He lived in Bellevue and we hit it off pretty well through bumble. He lived with his parents since he was attending college and working and didn't make enough to move out and wasn't in school enough classes to move into dorms.
He came from a pretty privileged background his dad a white collar worker, a boss of a boss for a tech company in Seattle. His mom, too disabled to work and had to retire early.
He had one sibling, older than him that was moved out and attending school.

Everyday was bliss. It went from getting yelled at by some patients family at work then going home to a house of family members who hated eachothers guts. I lived with my little sister in a small room and being both adults wasn't ideal at all, we would fight over space all the time. But my mom didn't have the money to move us to a larger house where we'd have our own space.

But on the weekends? The weekends....it was another world. The grass felt greener on the other side. Weekdays was long shifts and a hoarders house of spoiled milk and leftovers piled in a fridge. My mother and sisters fighting at night until I'd wake up at 4 in the morning to go back to work but the weekends....

I went to Jackie's house. Clean food, clean water, no bug infestations, no fear of spoiled food and botulism, no fear of having to buy take out and sleeping in moldy bed sheets. The weekends. They were what I needed.

His parents knew that I was living in a bad home and made it known that I could go to their home at any time to escape for a breather before going back to work and paying off student loans.

Come October last year I had to move into his parents due to my school charging me 200 more on my student loans each month. That along with paying moms rent and gas meant I was spending more money than I was making.

I got into a huge argument with my mom, I asked her if I could spend less on rent due to an increase in loan payments and she didn't take it well. I took an uber to spend the night at Jackie's. I woke up with the idea to move in. The clinic that I worked at had a unit in Bellevue. If I had gone up the ladder from Receptionist to tech I'd be making more. But I'd be paying just the rent and loans instead of my mom's gas, the groceries, utilities ect ect ect.
I talked with Jackie's parents and they let me stay, knowing I was in a bad home they set a plan for me to move in and work full time so I could pay off my debt. They said no matter what happened to Jackie and I, their house was a safe haven.

Jackie broke up with me on the 13th of October this year. 2 days after our 2nd anniversary. I'll save the details because that can be it's own post here since it relates heavily to my post traumatic.

But when we broke up, I had been kicked out by his parents. The break up wasn't over something bad that he or I did to eachother, we just realized we didn't work out since we were both dealing with stuff. Jackie was trying to deal with trauma they had gone through years ago that they didn't realize had effected them till he started to see it effect our relationship. And I the same.

We both agreed to split and go no contact. Our feelings towards eachother indifferent.

I had to move back into my moms house. And it's been hard doing that while grieving my first relationship and my first LONG TERM relationship. My little sister, Ce, has been there for me but only for a bit until it exhausts her. I get it, my house is a family who hasn't properly grieved their traumas and don't believe in therapy (unfortunately).

Getting back into this environment is hard. 

I have to walk on eggshells around my mom and sisters. The food here is spoiled and my mom keeps buying more food that only then becomes spoiled because there's no room in the fridge for it to be put in.

Talking about the trash in the house has been hush hush. I get that working with hoarders it's very important to not make note of the hoarding and instead approach it from a point of understanding their trauma. But if I actually want to help my mom then it needs to involve an actual therapist to coach the act of removing the hoard.

My sister Ce has given up on trying to help my mom since she's tried everything and came to a point ""here. You're more likely to get kicked out by mom for mentioning the kitchen than you would catch botulism from 7 day old leftovers.""

The first week moving back in after breaking up with Jackie, I was incredibly suicidal. I went back to the house I promised I wouldn't come back to. I was kicked out and into the house my exes parents promised they would not send me back to.
I didn't have Jackie to text for support whenever the house became too much for me. Never mind I'm never welcomed into his home again, be it his parents or his future apartment.

I have no one.

The only thing that's helped me is a couple of friend of mine I've reconnected with, listening to music especially Tyler, the creators new album, watching all the shows I used to watch with Jackie as well as the shows I promised him we would watch together.

Coming back to a house like this is extremely triggering. And it's hard to move out since everything is expensive and I'm still in debt so I don't have the credit score to get me a car or an apartment even if I wanted to or could afford it, I wouldn't get it with my score due to being in debt.

I don't know how I'm going to get out of this all. But I hope to post more on here to connect with people who have post traumatic as I can expect will need a support group now that I'm back in a not so great environment.

I'm trying to find hope everyday and everyday I'm finding a little bit of myself again after my break up.
I still have my job, I'm so grateful for that and my boss for transferring me to a unit that's closest to my mom's place so I don't have to lose my job.

I lost a home that accommodated my needs, a family who listened and understood me, a boyfriend who gave me the love I told myself I never deserved. I'm not about to lose my job.

There's hope. I'm not about to let all this get in the way of me getting out. Promise, I'm gon make it out.",ptsd

They kept it inside of them for years and I am the only person in the whole world that knows about their predicament (they told me couple of months back). I feel genuinely awful for them and lose sleep because of that...but the same time I am deeply frustrated because I have no idea what to do.

I listen and give advice but I only see it through my lenses. My advices seem rational and good to me but I didn't live through what they did and could just be doing more harm than good. I am definitely pushing for therapy (although it might not be so developed in their country...)

What are the best approaches here? I am very lost. Letting them vent seems to help them but only short term... probably because this is so outside of my field

I despise the person my trauma makes me I got emotionaly abused by my mother and she had a boyfriend once he physically abused me and the worst part is she let it happen. She knew what he was doing. He once choked me unconscious while she was watching. I was so scared I peed myself a little bit but instead of being there for me she slapped me and let him smash my head onto the TV cabinet . The abuse wasn't what hurt and still hurts. It is the fact that she not only let it happen but that she was willingly part taking in it . And what did I do to deserve this? My grades were bad and my mother didn't like that . This was for years ago and I cut contact with her year ago (on the fifth of June to be precise).

Id really like to start my own business again so I don't have to rely on other people's behaviors to make it through the day. But I'm just so lost. If anyone can give any advice. I've just lost all hope and I am up for any guidance. I've had PTSD for 35 years. It's not a passing phase. I need a job that is sustainable. Thank you for ready. Please be kind. ,ptsd
"I am finally getting my independence back!! Four years ago I survived two separate traumas with in a span of two months apart, the second was a violent trauma and both nearly killed me but the second was way worse and it's taken me years to get through.  

What happened to me isn't important but what is important is I'm starting to get my independence back!  I haven't left my house alone in four years, I haven't driven a car in four years.  Yesterday I was required to drive with others and while the trauma I survived wasn't based around cars or driving it was still something I haven't done and I was nervous! 

Today I had to drive someone to work and then drive home... alone.  Driving home by myself was the first time I was alone outside my home in four years and I did great!!  I'm actually excited to do it again and I'm starting to get back what I lost.  Physically I am significantly healthier then I was before my trauma, psychologically I've been apprehensive but I am happier then I've been most my life, just not independent until today!  Wish me luck?",ptsd
"How to be able to eat when dealing with trauma? I'm processing a lot of traumas at the moment following a break-up from a long-term  relationship that was very toxic in a lot of ways (on both sides btw, I'm processing harms I've done as well as harms done to me). But anyway, I am struggling so much with food and eating right now and I don't know how to manage and how to get support.

It's always been this way with trauma. As a kid, I was abused for years and my eating was so affected that doctors had to get involved. Whenever I've had traumatic events, I just cannot eat. It's like when I'm in trauma, my body is just incompatible with food. It's not a weight thing, I don't care about my weight right now. At the start, it felt like an upside that I was getting to lose some weight but I'm starting to hate how much weight I've lost in the last two months. I look sick and I feel weak all the time. 

Right now, I just cannot eat unless I'm around other people or unless I guilt myself into trying to look after myself. I hate this so much. Food makes me feel nauseated to think about and it feels wrong in my mouth. Chewing feels disgusting and I have to distract myself to get it down my throat. I'm mildly panicking at the thought of trying to eat dinner alone tonight and I'm already trying to mentally justify why it's okay to skip it.

Can anyone relate? I feel like such a freak and I tried posting on an eating disorder sub but it's not the same. I don't know how to heal this. I don't know how to feel safe eating food. Has anyone had any success managing this and can offer some advice?

"Angry that I'm alive Hi there. I just needed to vent somewhere about this and I haven't been able to find real support on this...

I am angry that I'm alive. Not all the time, but most of it. I have chronic pain and other medical issues on top of several mental health diagnoses and I often feel like they all tag team me to make sure I'm miserable. My baseline at most any given time is uncomfortable, which is always present in some way, even when I feel decent or am having a fun time. I hurt, inside and out.

I can't get away from the memories. The triggers are everywhere and are immensely invasion. I feel everything so intensely that it takes everything in me not to resort to SH just to feel something different and in my control. I think about ending things more than I'd ever like my family and loved ones to know. 

I think about the spiritual side to things and all the existential questions. Why am I here? Why was I born? Is there a reason to this all or are we just some ant farm experiment from a sadistic higher power? I have my own thoughts about spirituality and am pagan, but I struggle hard. I'm angry that I'm here and a lot of the things I hear for an answer as to why I'm here in this life feel intensely disgusting to me and they don't make sense. I can't accept hearing that ""I chose to incarnate here for my soul contract in this life, so I'm going through all this because I agreed to it before I was born"" and the like. That feels victim blamy and yucky. It doesn't make me feel empowered. It makes me feel condemned from the start and like I'd like to strangle my spirit self for this, therefore I can't accept this being the way things are. This isn't up for debate here, I'm just mentioning this because it's where I'm coming from. I don't want a bunch of religious stuff debated or thrown at me. That's not why I'm here writing this.

I just want to know how to cope with being in so much pain that existing hurts, living is a chore, and in turn, I'm pissed off that I'm here. This includes being angry about being thrust into living in a society that seems not to like people like me. I love my parents and all, but ffs... I'm so tired. ",ptsd

"Panic Attack - PTSD Caused? I am diagnosed with PTSD, I had a severe panic attack earlier and couldn't figure out, does ptsd cause panic attacks only related to the trauma or make you more susceptible to panic attacks. I got a panic attack because I was listening to a documentary, though I had no relation to anything that anyone experienced in it I felt myself getting anxious and feeling uh not safe feelings and quickly escalated into heart racing and being unable to breath and think, suddenly scared someone was going to be watching me from every angle or break into my house and hurt me.

Honestly I don't go many places because I'm disabled in multiple ways, and now PTSD has gotten added to that list.

"Does anyone else feel weird about setting boundaries?  
So, bit of a weird one. Mention of physical attack and mention of previous abuse but nothing too graphic

I have been particularly triggered recently, panic attacks/flashbacks related to csa/sa etc. I was attacked at work by a patient who grabbed my neck, penned me in and then tried to punch me which started these up worse than normal. 

I was relaxing at a friends house and she noticed how toned my legs had become and touch them to feel the muscle. All in good fun between close friends who are basically sisters ya know. I asked her to stop which she did imediately and apologised for making me feel uncomfortable. 

I then felt bad for setting the boundary and apologised to her for being weird about something innocious and something we are used to doing. She said i don't have to explain anything, i set a boundary and thats perfectly okay, i have body automony etc Everything was fine but i was worrying that id hurt her feelings. She it not someone who makes me feel bad/guilty about things but i felt bad, i dunno if its because we are used to people not listening to us or because im triggered (hate this word but its appropiate) at the moment. I can't have people touch me even in a friendly way at the moment even for hugs if i've not initiated it myself and usually i've been  fine. 

Anyway the details aren't really the issue its just more why do we feel bad about setting boundaries? Does anyone else do this/know why we do this?

5 years ago i was dating this girl (MTF)  who raped me, its a long story but essentially we where both on sex enhancing drugs (meth) weve been dating for a few months at this point and the sex was fine and going well until it wasn't, i was laying down when she began to penetrate me with her fingers and it began to hurt and i told her to slow down it hurt, she then went faster and said ""not it doesnt' then commented on how 'tight' i was and how i just needed loosening up. she kept going, i kept saying no stop and she kept ignoring me, it hurt more as she went, i dissociated the rest of the it and she kept going until i finished and i felt horrific, i felt dirty and assaulted which i was, i broke up with her. then confided in someone i considered a friend at the time who was also friends with her, after telling her what happened my friend let me know what had happened was sexual assault and when i was ready i should report it, i never ended up getting around doing that as 'the friend' told her instantly what i had said and they where quick to get to together and talk about what happened ( i was not present at this get together) i was then confronted in the days following by other friends who i had not told about this saying that 'she' had told them that i had instead raped her and i need to stop lying and upsetting her with this. i, a man. had to tell a bunch of other men in the room who had no business knowing what was supposed to be between one other person what had happened to me in detail to be believed. there was heaps of shit and lies they created together just to try and silence me, another friend at the time who i tried to tell wasnt interested in hearing it and when someone brought me over to let them know i was raped they turned around and said ""fuck off get out i cant hear this right now"" i was angry at my mates and cut all of them out of my life, they couldn't be the mates i needed at the lowest point of my life and thought it was a joke and used it as a excuse to start drama, now me and that same close friend as made up in that time, and 5 years later we had a fight recently where i brought his response to me being sexually assaulted was proof to me that he doesn't give a fuck about anyone except himself, he then took that as a reason to message my rapist (her) and start the drama up again saying that i am starting all this shit when i didn't even mention her, i told my friend his response to me getting hurt was fucking shit and now im getting messages from all sorts of people from that time harrassing me saying im a bitch and whinger and stop talking about it, others saying shes going to go to the police and drag me through the court process to prove im a liar and as of right now, i have no one that believes me and its traumatizing me all over again and pushing me to crisis and people like my close friend think that its funny. this all happened after i started standing up for myself against toxic people in my life. lol.

"Is there any end to it? In my mid 30's. Been actively trying to get help since 23. Married 4 years now and my wife is talking of leaving she cant handle it. She's already left a few times on the condition I will change. I do my best to treat her the best I can but it's not good enough.

I am emotionally dulled I think. I have anxiety, depression, and flashbacks that interfere with my daily life such as work.

Age 2-18 abused daily by parental units and some siblings (physical, mental, emotional, and spiritually). In my late teens started abusing myself (cutting), and then drugs and alcohol heavily until 26. Have been in recovery for drugs and alcohol almost 2 years now, and have seen countless therapists over the past 10 years. Working on seeing a new one that can do emdr.

Everytime she threatens to leave (she does this by not coming home from work and staying at a friends house a couple days to a week to think things over) it sets my triggers off like you wouldn't believe, feelings of worthlessness, abandonment, and fear i will lose my best friend if i can't change fast enough. This triggers even more flashbacks and makes sleeping or work even harder. I just discovered 2 years ago I REALLY need stability in my life and these events really throw everything off balance.

I want to get better and have made some great progress the past couple years but it often seems like theres no end to it.

TL;DR tell me there's some hope, I need some happy success stories with ""becoming a real person"" despite having ptsd.",ptsd

"Trauma(?) dreams I don‚Äôt understand I have a lot of weird dreams connected to my father (who I haven‚Äôt seen since I was 13). The worst part is that I know they‚Äôre not real but they‚Äôre disturbingly vivid. I don‚Äôt know what to think of it.

My dreams are usually about being raped at his house, the one he was in when my parents divorced. Whether by him, by a friend of his, or by his girlfriend, it‚Äôs always got something to do with him. One time he was the one abusing me. One time he found me in the aftermath and blamed me for it. One time it was his girlfriend. Nothing about these dreams is consistent except sexual violence and him being there. 

I also remember being terrified of undressing in his house. I didn‚Äôt feel safe. Getting ready for school was a nightmare and bathing made me sick to my stomach. I don‚Äôt know what I was so afraid of but I would have anxiety attacks about it. There are a few odd memories that stand out too. He once spanked me, pants and underwear down, as punishment for something when I was little. Another time I was undressed for a bath crying because I was so upset while he was watching me to make sure I actually bathed. He never abused me though. I think these dreams are just the wires crossing in my head between my sexual abuse (unrelated to my parents) and the feelings of abandonment from him leaving? I‚Äôm not sure, but it scares me",ptsd

"I was raped when passed out drunk 2 years ago and I‚Äôm only getting upset about it now. Confused why I‚Äôm upset when it wasn‚Äôt personal and I have few memories of it I got seperated from my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô on a night out and went back to her hotel to try and find her. My last memory of the night was in a room with at least 4 men in and was later found by other hotel guests naked in the corridor and my stuff was dumped in the outside bins. I woke up the next morning in her room not knowing anything bad had happened until I heard her on the phone to the police. Condoms with my DNA were found inside the room. 

A part of me is angry and upset that people are like that out there, but I know of the evil in the world and have read about much worse. I feel like I‚Äôve got over this.

I‚Äôm also upset that I wasn‚Äôt more demanding of answers from police. I understand this was my brain in defence mode and believing it wasn‚Äôt true to protect myself. 

I‚Äôm angry at my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô for totally abandoning me when I was extremely drunk. She‚Äôs not in my life anymore, she was always a shit friend and I should have never trusted her. I‚Äôm grateful that I know the kind of friend I deserve now. 

I‚Äôm angry that I got black out drunk so many times before that, always told myself I wouldn‚Äôt do it again, yet it kept happening. I‚Äôm annoyed that I drank so much around someone I had never gone out drinking with before. I‚Äôm guilty that I put my real friends through nights out with me as a liability. This I‚Äôm blaming on being young and not setting myself strict enough rules around drinking. I have learnt from this and I‚Äôm glad I will be safer in future.

I also keep finding any excuse to make the men and their behaviour ok, like maybe I was compliant at first (still is rape). I‚Äôm telling myself I know nothing, anything could‚Äôve happened. It wasn‚Äôt personal.

"I have recently gone through a very stressful situation involving gun violence and need help/advice/someone that has gone through similar situation to talk about it with me. Flashbacks don't stop, I can't stop thinking about it, and can't find any logical reason for this event to have happened to me Very recently while riding my motorcycle on my way home, using the same route I've been using almost daily for over 2 years, I had an unhappy encounter with a reckless person with no self control at all. It started at an avenue, traffic was stopped, I was filtering since I was on a motorcycle, and suddenly another person on a motorcycle pops out of nowhere and tries to squeeze between me and a car, but failed because there was not enough space, so I went in front, and noticing the way he was riding, I decided to move quickly to get some distance from him, but he was following me. I was starting to go dangerously fast but I was pretty chill at the moment moving between traffic just enjoying the moment and he was trying hard to keep up, so I weaved my hand to the side for him to pass me or at least try to, but he couldn't. That made him so upset I could never ever imagine how a simple joke or something supposed to be a funny moment could startle someone like that. Moments later, when traffic was less dense, I reduced my speed, not much worried about him, but he caught up and didn't pass me, but rather started kicking my bike to try to make me lose balance and fall. I was like ""what the hell man?"" but I didn't say anything. Then I stopped and he stopped next to me looking very angry, and he suddenly starts reaching for a gun. He pulled a gun on me in the middle of the traffic, and I was just looking at him not understanding his reaction, I just said ""calm down man, I'm sorry if I did anything that bothered you"" Something along those lines (I can't remember perfectly as it was super quick and stressful). He pointed the gun at me and even hit me (it left a bruise on the side of my chest where he hit me) to intimidate. Meanwhile I was trying to not escalate things at all, because at that point I knew I was dealing with a crazy person and even the slightest form of confrontation could lead to me getting shot. I didn't complain about anything, and acted like it wasn't a big deal, just telling him stuff like ""sorry, my bad"" (although I knew I didn't have to be sorry for anything). He was probably expecting a fight or some sort of panic reaction from me, but since things didn't go like that he couldn't say anything, he only stared at me for some more seconds and told me to leave quickly. I left then and told the police everything. ",ptsd

"Has anyone intentionally gone back in time to resurface your traumas? This only applies given the fact that you HAVE overcome addiction derived from PTSD or a particular trauma but this is open to all opinions of whatever your nature of suffering is or overcame. 

The reason I am doing this from 2018 - 2023 I worked for a boss who didn't do my tax or super. So doing stat Dec now. I was an apprentice (plumber), I'm extremely tough and I'm as tough as they come (I'm not boasting, its fact I was unbreakable), the company, 1 boss, 1 apprentice, company pays late all the time, boss was a narcissist, the anger the shouting all that jazz, paid annual leave 3 weeks after NYE THE FU**I*G DOG. Didn't bother me, I was good until 2022, caught by police unregistered work van (3rd time caught over a 5 month span THIS is when I mentally SNAPPED or soul left body), I used the van to go tafe for exams that day, that day I became an alcoholic, did too much for someone and left myself to shit like a slave. Overworked and red-lining, as in instead of working optimal like average society just turn up to work and go home do 9 to 5 where its somewhat pleasing, chat with co-workers, bludge a bit, pull sickies, not to worry much kinda things, proper company rules regarding employee saftey and treatement, no abusive behaviour, everyone respectfully monitored but my position? Throw all that shit out the window: this place required operating over the maximum capacity everyday, I was born for this but c'mon EVERYDAY! well super rare to get chill days (this is long story short.)

I printed 400 pages of bank statements, THEREFORE required to highlight wages paid as there were no payslips; company did not do group certificates, and instead of just high lighting the wages I went further resurfacing and writing down small entries I remember in a journal when seeing the dates and leaving notes on the bank statements, I found means to go through photos, messages, spending 5 hours on separate days apart through a 4 week period, marking days of trauma/what happened on normal days, I have successfully conjured the state that was in the past as of 25 OCT 2024. That meant I was sober for 5 months and I have decided to intentionally drink just to feel more of that old pain so I could write what that old self was feeling. Bringing my old self back who I tried killing.

If I've come this far why turn back? Before you all say it's a mistake, you must believe these following words; I am in control of this, I am powerful, it's just that this particular suffering that I spent a year forgetting never disappeared, everything I've overcame is not on any scale, my instinct leads me knowing Im ready to face my past and learn)

My tax is almost done 10% left. It was tough going through it and doing all this can be reused for another purpose like super insurance claims and workers comp documentation. Making a claim was never my intention but it seems as I'm doing my tax, it appears as though my notes reliving the past serve an extra purpose.

FYI: I stopped work July 19 2024 due to being diagnosed with AVN avascular necrosis. I cannot work like normal again. Hip needs surgery and I'm 33.

The trauma changed me a lot and like it‚Äôs like I went from being a carefree innocent sweet trusting child too a cold empty shell. I no longer played with toys. I no longer played with my sister or my friends. And it kept on happening I kept on being raped for like a year. As ive gotten older Ive resented my childhood being taken from me so quickly.

Today I was having a really bad flashback then suddenly it was like I became a kid idk how to describe it like I felt like I was a child again like even my inner monologue was my childhood voice. Like I completely forgot about the trauma and I went into a drawer I keep of some of my old teddies and I started playing with them. It was really fun then suddenly halfway through I became myself again. And I started bawling my eyes out crying.

"Symptoms resurfacing years after ART? Hi I hope this type of post is allowed. NOT asking for medical or diagnostic help!! Just wondering if current symptoms align with any accepted knowledge about ptsd/ART/ phobias. 

 I had pretty bad diagnosed ptsd after a single incident a few years ago. Happened when I was 18, received ART advance resolution therapy at 20 and it genuinely felt like I was ‚Äúcured‚Äù for years (specific triggers sometimes but not the regular day-to-day). 

I‚Äôm 23 now and I think a lot of it is back. But for no reason. I‚Äôm aware of retraumatization but NOTHING happened. I just noticed hyper-vigilance, tunnel vision, and mild dissociation is occurring now whenever I‚Äôm out at night, even in groups of people and in ‚Äúsafe‚Äù environments. 

I have a really bad phobia unrelated to ptsd (fully irrational one) and lately it has been so bad that I am constantly panicking no matter where I am. The thing is‚Äî I‚Äôve noticed my phobia gets more active when other things are at issue and although it‚Äôs always bad, it isn‚Äôt always ‚Äúcan‚Äôt walk down the street at night‚Äù bad. So when I‚Äôm having my hypervigilance etc. walking at night I am actively panicking about my phobia but the symptoms match what ptsd was like for me and are the same severity of my ptsd hypervigilance when the phobia version was never THAT bad. 

In short‚Äîcan ptsd randomly resurface with no external factors after years of it not really being an issue due to ART? And it is it possible that it‚Äôs the PTSD leftover even if I‚Äôm actively thinking (in the moment) that the panic is from a phobia?",ptsd
"Advice/ TW everything I do not know what to do anymore. Long story short: my mother‚Äôs a bipolar drug addict and my dad works 4 jobs. There‚Äôs 5 of us but 3 of my siblings got removed from my parents custody by child services years ago and so it was just me and my sister left. Last year was probably the worst year of my life abuse wise and the only reason I am here today is because of my sister, I can tell you right now my mother would‚Äôve killed me or I would‚Äôve killed myself if it weren‚Äôt for her. Now my sisters in college and it‚Äôs just me all alone, everything has been okay-ish, or as okay as it can be so far. With the occasional hits and fights and having to deal with my mother drunk/high. I‚Äôm currently writing this post at my chorus concert crying in the bathroom. I‚Äôm having an anxiety attack because last year after my mother had promised me she‚Äôd come to my chorus concert and she didn‚Äôt (I don‚Äôt even know why I expected her to she hasn‚Äôt been in years) I was really mad on my way back to my house when the concert had ended and when I walked into my house I found my mother passed out on the floor covered in blood. As I said before she‚Äôs bipolar. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm freaking out, but also sad that it‚Äôs my first concert my sister wont be at because she‚Äôs in college, and my dads working, so I have no one here. Another thing is ive been very hypervigilant because I can tell my mothers becoming manic and that mixed with the drugs sends her into this (sorry if I‚Äôm misusing the term) but like almost drug induced psychosis. Yesterday she was just standing outside out house with no shirt on screaming and banging on the garage doors and house and screaming at no one. But what makes me most nervous is how bad it got last time. Last time it got like this there was one really bad day, she basically tried to rape my father, and when he tried to get away she put a knife to him and then gave him the knife and started screaming/crying and begging him to murder her and when he wouldn‚Äôt kill her (because why tf would he) she punched him in the face repeatedly till he got a black eye, and then she came upstairs and was yelling at my sister so I was like leave her alone and she ended up coming to me and shoved me againt the wall, then putting me to the window telling me to jump out and kill myself and that no one needs me and stuft and I dont even know if id be here right now if it werent fir my sister who intervened. But im really freaking out right now an idek what I was lookijng to get out of this post other than to say I need help and I dont know what to do. I‚Äôm just a kid. Someone please give me advice or something please im begging I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore and I cant do it anymore. Sorry if this post is way out of line.",ptsd
"I Really Need Help, Not Sure What to Do I was diagnosed with PTSD when I saw a therapist last year and I'm wondering if anyone has a similar problem as I do. I decided to see a therapist, because I didn't know what was wrong with me.

I have this problem where I am ""possessed with hatred"" over someone who bullied me or tried to intimidate me. I engage in this odd ritual, (not sure what this is or if it has a medical name), where I bite my hand and imagine violently killing and torturing the person who bullied or intimidated me. I'm not sure how to get rid of this, I just want it to stop.

Hatred is always haunting me. I remember events from my past where I was bullied, intimidated, made fun of, or tricked into doing something without understanding that I was being ""played with"". Some of these memories are over a decade old. 

It always begins with me feeling a strong sense of anger for not standing up for myself when someone bullied or intimidated me. Now it's gotten so bad, if someone honks at me or does something slightly intimidating or tries to make fun of me, I do this ""rage ritual"" of biting my hand and imaging myself killing them in a very violent way. 

Again, I just want this to go away. Does anyone have this problem and if so, what are you doing to treat it? Thanks.",ptsd

"Do I have PTSD or am I being dramatic? 
‚ÄºÔ∏èTW: ABUSE, DRINKING‚ÄºÔ∏è

So, my father was the worst type of person you could meet. He was a narcissistic, selfish man and only ever cared about himself.

He had a massive drinking problem, and was constantly drunk or hungover. 
Whenever I would so much as check the time on my phone, I would get yelled and screamed at. Sometimes he would even hit me.

Now, I always thought this was normal behaviour. I never told my friends about it because I figured what‚Äôs the point? 

One night I was playing with my little sister, when she accidentally bumped into the coffee table. My dad immediately looked over at me, and started yelling at me that I should be more responsible. I‚Äôm pretty sure he even hit me. I was too overwhelmed, so I ended up running to my room and just crying in bed. At some point my mother must have been called (my parents are divorced) because she had arrived and tried to comfort me. I ended up going home with her, and said I didn‚Äôt want to see him anymore. So I haven‚Äôt.

Anyways, back to the original point of this post, I‚Äôve recently been having flashbacks to that night and a few other bad nights, and it‚Äôs really taken a toll on me. I‚Äôve told some of my friends the brief version of what he did to me, but no one knows the full story except for me. 

Is this PTSD, or is it just a normal thing that comes with trauma?",ptsd
"Fireworks for days I‚Äôm just exhausted. It‚Äôs been days of this, every evening. I‚Äôm trying to do everything right. I‚Äôve medicated. I had snacks earlier in the day. I‚Äôm trying to drink a ‚Äúsuper food‚Äù smoothie to make sure I still get nutrients. I drank plenty if water so I‚Äôm not dehydrated. I‚Äôm doing all the things I‚Äôm supposed to.

I don‚Äôt want to be grumpy about other people having fun, but every evening people are sending up loud bright fireworks right in the street, & I‚Äôm just so tired of flinching with every bang.

I should be grateful I guess. I‚Äôve spent fireworks days frozen in fear under the covers before now, but I‚Äôm just upset. Every year it seems like fireworks goes on for more & more days.

"How do you find a happy medium?! I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2020. I basically ruined my life and as of January of this year, I‚Äôm bouncing back better than ever. Long story short, lots of drugs and alcohol and whatever else I could do to numb myself. But now, as I‚Äôm actually living fairly sober, I‚Äôm noticing I get very overwhelmed by how I structure my day. At first, I wasn‚Äôt doing jack shit. I work from home, so I‚Äôd just do that and play with my dog. literally the end of my day. Now, I‚Äôm really into fitness and have been for a few months, but there are some days where just thinking about having to work AND squeeze in a 40 min workout completely overwhelms me. I‚Äôm still able to do these things, but there‚Äôs a basically a mini meltdown in my brain for a good 2-3 mins. As long as I keep my feet moving, I‚Äôm fine. But it‚Äôs been getting worse and worse lately. I know I‚Äôm mentally better off when I have a very regimented schedule but now it feels like it‚Äôs too much? And when I think about it in the grand scheme of things, I‚Äôm not doing any more than I have in the past. I‚Äôve had to go into work and be a real adult even when at my worst and it didn‚Äôt feel this overwhelming. In addition to this, any time I leave my house for any reason, I‚Äôm nervous as shit. And it‚Äôs never anything specific, just a pit of fear in my stomach. I could be going to see family and I have to take something beforehand just to cope. Once I‚Äôm there, I‚Äôm good. It‚Äôs the getting there part. I had a date last night and almost threw up during the date. I‚Äôve never been this way.

Am I still getting acclimated to my brain? Does anyone else experience this?

On another note, there are some other signs that may point to ADHD‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt want to self diagnose by any means, but it has been hinted that ADHD could be the case even by others.

"Why do incoviences or mild upsets send me spiraling at points? I'll have days or points where I'm ok but then something happens that's a bit upsetting and it sends me into a giant depressive spiral.

Even if it has nothing to do with my trauma, something negative popping up puts my head in a place to think about everything and anything else that hurt me, or is bothering me and when I get in that mindset I don't have the clarity to pull myself aside or stop myself in the depressive spiral.

For instance last night my boyfriend clarified to me that he didn't like me having a wish list and that it bothered him that I would just go to him for those things, I'm disabled and when I can't cover some things currently I feel more comfortable trying to find a way to get them on my own (nothing illegal) than risking feeling like a mooch despite that not really being an issue with my bf. I grew up with my mother as a single parent and to put it briefly I alway watch what I get and feel guilty or wrong when getting things I don't necessarily need.

So I made the wishlist as a ""if anyone feels like it, feel free to take a look"" essentially no obligation just it's there if anyone would like to. The items I put on it are items I hope or intend to get in the future either for my cat who has osteoarthritis or for me to help with rough points of my disabilities or to help me further my education and studies.

My boyfriend didn't say anything bad and actively promoted it the first time, then yesterday this time the second time I promoted it he had an issue with it and said it was about principal.

I wasn't promoting it in anyway that was wrong relationship wise or suggestive/nsfw and there's nothing like that on my list. I simply mentioned it  very off to the side and not in tour face of an account of mine.

He had an issue with it, and was insinuating I should delete it. I went ahead and did but I let him know I was disappointed that it was an issue and that he disliked it so much, I by the end told him that I'd like him to clarify more why it bothered him as he really only gave ""a matter of principal"" and ""I really don't like any online relationships"" (it's an anonymous wishlist so idk what he means, and I made sure he knew the wishlist wouldn't have me talking to anyone or vise versa or revealing any personal info.)

I was upset after this because the night I repromoted it I had added a good amount more and had put a good amount of time into picking things out and adding little descriptions.

By the end of all this I deleted anything promoting the wishlist and any links to them but I was upset it felt like I had to do that at all. I let him know I wasn't happy with the outcome and didn't really get to finish before he decide he was gonna head back to bed cutting me off in the process. (I have asked him not to start uncomfortable or messed up conversations/the like before bed at a point before this because his go to is to start it and then cut it off when he realizes it's late despite it already being late when he brought it up.)

So I went to bed upset when I had been good and then the spirals started, I started feeling down fell asleep, woke up again during the night in a depressive mental state couldn't sleep to almost 5 am and during the time I let him know about the other things that were bothering me or had me in a bad mindset. (Our time zones are different right now so when it was almost 5 for me it was regular morning hours for him)

And I just UHG I'm so tired and exhausted of deteriorating into these spirals and then feeling like a giant burden after.

I can't control them and I don't know what to do. My therapist has given me ways to try and break the spiral but I feel that don't really do anything and I'm still in the same spot mentally.

I'm insanely lonely and all I have right now is my cat, family is abusive and or far away and don't reach out much. Family friend is also out of the country and was supposed to vome back sooned but made the assumrion that I'm fine because i'm doing well with my studies and decide to stay longer without talking to me, my boyfriend is studying abroad and gets exhausted with any sort of emotionally taxing conversations and just shuts down most of the time, and I have no emotional support network I'm completely alone and I'm ok sometimes and then I have days where I just break down and can't handle it, and then I can't even vent that much because no one can handle it or is abusive and I can't share this stuff with them.

I feel like I'm losing my mind, I can't get anything more important done without help and I have little to none right now and the help I do have is anxiety inducing and very spotty/unreliable.

I'm trying so hard and I don't know what to do",ptsd
"An anxious shower experience I was in the shower this morning. Last night I had a really bad ptsd episode after several months, almost a year of being clean of it. In the shower, I was having flashbacks of little 3 year old me, unconscious after my parents had drugged me. They were moving my limp body to a hospital bed. They began to sit me up to take my clothes off. I could feel their and the doctors‚Äô hands touching me all over and holding me up. I could see my head drooping forward as they began to put the hospital robe on me. In the present I could feel the weight of their actions pressing on me and I couldn‚Äôt help but brace myself, tighten my glutes because they felt the most vulnerable and shake. I wish it hadn‚Äôt happened like this. I wish they cared for me and didn‚Äôt spend a lifetime neglecting me. Once I got out I thought of the way my parents used to hold me down firmly as I screamed and cried and said I was scared because during the ophthalmology check up the doctor would ask the secretary to put stinging eye drops on me that would dilate my pupil and prevent me from seeing. I felt so vulnerable and violated and scared. This would happened yearly. They would never pay me any mind, wouldn‚Äôt console me but simply stare and minimize my experience with their words. I wish I had parents who understood their actions and had the guts to face them and tell me they were wrong. Hell my throat hurts from writing this.",ptsd
"Uncomfortable by T just saying ""okay"" when I disclose trauma or difficult events I have been seeing my T for trauma and to do EMDR (along with talk therapy and CBT). One thing that makes me really uncomfortable is that whenever I retell my trauma stories or tell her about a difficult experience, she'll just respond with ""okay"" as I'm telling the story and at the end. I know Ts needs to be neutral, not show any emotion/intense reactions and be nonjudgmental when clients disclose trauma, but it makes me feel crazy when I talk about something horrific and I get ""okay"" in response as if I just said I'm thinking of waffles over pancakes for breakfast tomorrow. It makes me feel many things, like she's not seeing the seriousness of what I am sharing or that she's not really listening.

Two months ago, I was telling T about one of my worst traumas: a major medical procedure in childhood where I was on the brink of death. The doctors were very callous towards me during and then after in recovery, even as I, for example, screamed bloody murder and was scared out of my mind and in pain. As I'm telling the story, with each horrible detail, I just get ""okay"" in response and then ""yeah, back then doctors didn't understand the psychological impact medical procedures had on kids."" Nothing even close to ""wow, that was horrible you went through something like that"" or ""it was wrong that they ignored your physical and mental suffering.""

Last month, I told her about the horror of recently going to get bloodwork and how they wouldn't let me lie down to do it so I ended up passing out on the floor. They tried lifting me and whacked my head hard on the floor instead. I managed to get up myself when they shook me awake, only to feel nauseous and vomit all over myself and collapse to the ground. At each point in the story, T goes just goes ""okay"" and then ""we can do some EMDR around that experience."" Again, T registers no shock or surprise at this experience and no reaction when I angrily ranted about the people at the lab, not even acknowledging that they behaved wrongly and inappropriately. I know she isn't supposed to pass judgment, but is she really not allowed to acknowledge that someone was obviously wrong?

Edit: I want to add that the ""okay"" response is for everything I bring to therapy, even if it's not trauma and just shitty experience. Some guy was riding my bumper and honking at me for three miles nonstop so I felt unbearably anxious? ""Okay."" A dentist's office lied to me about how much I'd have to pay out-of-pocket and charged me more? ""Okay."" An extended family member tricked me to get some money from me? ""Okay."" It's become maddening to me that T can never say or validate that those things or people are not right.",ptsd

"I blocked someone who use to abuse me after an argument.¬† # 

I was bullied pretty badly in high school and faced racism. Anything from being addressed as the n word to being picked up and slammed to the ground while a friend of the main bully recorded me.

I‚Äôve gotten a black eye from him even and nearly went blind. He faced no consequences as he was a master manipulator and people like him for being the high school ""Jock‚Äù.

He always said sorry then repeated the behaviour and laughed with his buddies about it. He even made fun of my heritage (where my parents are from in Africa).

I get an apology about two years after high school and it (in my opinion) looked like an apology for himself. Sure, he said he‚Äôs sorry (he‚Äôs said it so many times it doesn‚Äôt hold value) and was more focused on saying in his apology ""I understand you probably hate my guts"".

I accepted the apology because my dad told me to.

Since then, I‚Äôve been through addiction & other not-so-proud stuff I‚Äôm not interested in sharing here. I decided to message him after all these years (been about 10 now) and it was a friendly message. Leaning towards me calling him a lovely person and how I understand if he still feels bad for what he did to me and said I understand the message could go unseen but I just wanted to share.

He, yet again, said he feels bad about how he treated me and said I look like I‚Äôm doing well and he‚Äôs happy specifically for that.

I just asked him why he called me the n word all the time and would beat me up over it. I asked if he found racism funny at the time. He denied absolutely everything he did. I then sent him screenshots of how he use to speak to me and he said ""Man, I don‚Äôt remember saying that, clearly I did though, there‚Äôs no denying that photo. I honestly don‚Äôt remember using that word with you or others. No one deserves that"".

For the sake of convenience of this post I‚Äôll make it short. We went back and forth over it ((and he said ""James, deep down, do you really want to message me day in day out about this? God doesnt want this for you man, im not him but i think hed want you to forigive and heal) and he then accused me of spreading rumours about him over the last two years that he r\*\*\*d his ex and said how I can‚Äôt deny that as he has these messages pinned to my IP address.

I blocked him and unblocked him after an hour saying how crazy that sounds and specifically said the last time we spoke was in 2018/19 when he messaged me out of the blue. I then tell him if he has all that info, what does he plan on doing with it? And said intimidation and what he claims to be true do constitute grounds for legal action and said we can take this to court.

He says ""James, for the hundredth time, I‚Äôm done with these conversations. Chao for now"".

I said ""for the record, I hope those things are not true Chris, I just can‚Äôt connect the dots on why you think it‚Äôs me who did that. Chao"".

After a few days, I blocked him for good.

"I was at my gf‚Äôs house, hoy triggered and during an episode I yelled at her mom. now i‚Äôm not allowed to go there anymore, i don‚Äôt know what to do  I (19 F) struggle with C-PTSD, ASD and depression, my ptsd has many causes but I often get anxiety and panic attacks and dissociate which has led me to having many episodes in situations where i‚Äôm surrounded by people who don‚Äôt know how to act and have sometimes been very disrespectful to me, this is not exactly what happened here but i‚Äôm gonna explain.

My gf‚Äôs (23 F) family own a mini market which is right next to her house. my gf and I where hanging out in a little staff office in the mini market when her dad and one of the employees walked in, the employee was very distressed and my my gf‚Äôs dad explained that one of her employees (40 F) got electrocuted by touching an outlet. my gf and her dad left to go see what happened with the outlet and i was left with the employee, i noticed she was looking extremely anxious and since i know how anxiety attacks are I tried comforting her and teaching her how to do breathing exercises to calm her down, when she was doing better i want to check on my gf an her dad, they where checking the security cameras and her dad was extremely mad because in the video he saw she touched her own phone charger not the outlet which she was trying to blame and he went to question her about it being very disrespectful and mean to her despite her being in an obviously bad state. seeing this whole situation made me very upset and it started bringing me flashbacks to situations where i was having anxiety episodes and people where yelling at me and putting me in even more distressed, i didn‚Äôt say anything at the time but i was felt very dissociated and anxious after that.

then my gf went to tell her mom about everything that happened while I was there, her mom and I have always gotten along fairly well despite her usually being a very antisocial person.
her mom started defending that it was good that she got yelled at, saying that she deserved it and that she was ‚Äúexaggerating‚Äù and ‚Äúa manipulative liar‚Äù that‚Äôs when i got re triggered. i started feeling the face of everyone who had treated me that way in her face. i was so mad and stressed. i started crying and telling her how i‚Äôve been in situations like that and that people deserve empathy especially it situations where they went through something terrifying and they aren‚Äôt doing well, the only thing that should matter is their well being nothing else. i noticed how i couldn‚Äôt even talk right anymore and i didn‚Äôt even know who i was talking to anymore so i left. 

my gf followed me and tried comforting me but i started realizing how much i fucked up and she definitely looked worried about it too. 
i told her i would apologize and before i left she went to her mom telling her about how i wanted to apologize but she refused to hear me.

a week later my gf went to her family home again and talked to her mom about it trying to give her my apologies and explain the situation but her mom was still mad and told her that she didn‚Äôt want me to go to her house anymore and tried telling my gf basically that i‚Äôm a bad person for doing what i did and that she should leave me. 

now I don‚Äôt know what to do. my gf is very understanding of my but she‚Äôs also a bit disappointed by what i did and her mom is still mad.

"Am I lucky, abnormal, resilient, or just a ticking time bomb?  Hi all üëã I need to know if there's people like me out there. For context I'm a previously healthy 27yo female and 2 years ago had an unexpected massive MCA stroke. I was treated very quickly with a powerful clot-busting infusion which reversed 70% of the effects. It also triggered severe haemorrhage from some undiagnosed stomach ulcers (read: projectile vomiting pints of blood) which sent me to a resuscitation bay for an hour and a half.

I'm a veterinary surgeon by profession and during periods of consciousness fully understood the direness of the situation medically speaking. I probably would have at least offered euthanasia if this were happening to a dog. I experienced truly awful physical sensations including many different types and severities of pain, nausea, gasping air-hunger, pissing myself, and a relentless volley of non-consensual touch such as stripping/cutting of my clothes, attempts to access veins all over, urinary catheterisation, oral suction, and awakening to find a man cutting into my groin to place a pacemaking wire into my heart. Twice I politely asked a nurse if I was dying and twice I was told I was in the best hands (yikes).

I was told it was looking bad enough to need a medically induced coma but that survival to successful intubation in cases like this was poor. I was offered a priest but not access to my family in that moment(??). Ultimately they skillfully avoided the need for intubation by putting an endoscope down my throat and cauterising the bleeding while I choked on both the endoscope and my own blood. Don't get me wrong, I am actually grateful for that and impressed by it having performed lots of endoscopy myself.

Once stable, I spent time in ICU where the psychological trauma manifested itself as Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome) resulting in heart-attack-like symptoms and a couple of days of treatment for heart failure which did resolve.

After this was a relatively short (2 week) stint in stroke rehab where at the same time a region of skin died and fell off the inside of my right arm owing to escape of a drug under the skin during resus.

Emotionally, I had moments of raw fear for my family knowing the pain it would cause to lose me. I also quite naturally don't like pain or unexpected rough/intimate touch. But other than that, I cruised through the whole thing with a sense of acceptance and calmness, including the possibility of death. That especially wasn't a problem, in fact at moments I would have welcomed it as a relief.

I live on multiple medications and have some problems with strength, sensation, vision, fatigue and pain. But I have also since become an amateur climber and mountaineer in defiance. People ask about my visible scars, but I can speak openly about the experience and do so with a sense of humour and excellent story-telling. My partner (who I had not met at the time) finds this shocking. I have learnt information and techniques from the experience that I use on my patients.

I sometimes have dreams about drowning in blood and flickering ceiling panel lights give me enough sense of unease to try and move to a different room (I stared at one above me in resus). The sound of curtains on rails makes my hair stand up a bit. But that is all.

I declined every offer to see a psychotherapist or counsellor afterwards, didn't want to waste their appointments. I was raised by two nurses to be resilient and non-complaining, and I treat animals in various states of trauma every day. But I'm still surprised by how unaffected I am.

Are there others like me out there? Am I lucky to have the right brain chemistry to handle this, have my parents raised me well, am I a psychopath, or is this actually just suppression and in your experience is there a possibility this could all come out later in a big mess? Should I bother seeing a professional or can I just keep blissfully living my second life? I don't want to have to unpack it all unless absolutely necessary

Thank you all, and I'm sorry in advance that you have lived experiences that mean you are here to read this and respond. ",ptsd
"A lyric I found that just spoke to me so much... and made one thing make sense. ""They say time is a healer, life is a teacher  
Show you, show you the way  
They say time is a healer, making you stronger  
Well, if that's the case

**Then how am I still wounded?**""

  
The word *wounded* adds a layer not found with some other metaphors for trauma. Something I have been experiencing ever since I saw that ghost (my own).

A *scar*, once the injury is healed, doesn't hurt passively. It's a reminder of pain, but might not be pain itself.

  
A *wound* can hurt all. the. time. Even when it's not a sharp pain, you're always aware of it. And the smallest poke or stretch can set the wound ablaze. As if you're being wounded all over again. It's omnipresent. Always weighing down on you, even during your victories, big or small. Deciding to raise its voice just as you begin to relax after a hard day. Keeping you up at night.

That's what it feels like.",ptsd
"I have never shared my trauma on a platform with strangers before. Can it be classified as sexual abuse? I really wish I was held right now. I was born with severe astigmatism and strabismus (exotropia) on my left eye. After appointments made with approx. 8 doctors, they kept measuring the angle of my eyes I grew to know when the right time for surgery was. I was three years old when my parents lied to me. They hadn't allowed me to eat anything all day, saying we'd get fast food after we ""visited grandma at the hospital"". I was happy about it so we took the car. We stayed waiting in the waiting room for at least 2 hours. Suddenly, who I now know at the my ophthalmologist of like 10 years walked in and called us in a room. There was a painting of a ship battling a wild tide, more chairs with fake leather and those gold buttons lining them. I was asked if I wanted a drink. He came in with a white plastic cup filled with orange juice: but it looked dull, grey-ish, and smelled fishy. I tried a small sip and didn't like it, but I was pressured into drinking it all. I noticed my parents staring at me with tears in their eyes, crying. I felt panicked/distressed at the site, but suddenly my eyelids began to droop, I felt heavy, swaying on my feet. I felt sleepy in the most artificial way possible. They sedated me. My mom held me in her arms as I finally succumbed to the drug. I woke up with excruciating pain in my left eye. They'd covered it with one of their white patches. I was in hospital clothes on a hospital bed in hospital room. My grandma had never been there. A lady I didn't know came in with a dinosaur plushie, saying she was rewarding for being brave. I didn't know what she was talking about, I think they had me on other painkiller drugs. My parents never cared beyond my physical state, never asked how I felt ever in my life. They lied to me about everything. At the doctor's they would kick me out of the room, look at me weirdly and slam the door in my face any time my surgery had to be talked about. When I had the courage to bring it up, once I was beginning to remember the more I grew, they could only talk about how THEIR actions hurt THEM, not even acknowledging my struggle. My trauma manifested a lot in my dramatic play with dolls. They somehow always ended up drugged and at the hospital and then the scenario would go blank. It was as if my mind was asking me ""what next?"" I experienced severe reactions once I fully remembered everything at age 12. I felt so betrayed, anxious, and terrified of my family. Whenever I set a boundary such as ""don't touch me"", they always violated it despite my protests and fear every time. It still happens. I was severely emotionally neglected in all aspects. Later on, I began feeling the hands of the surgeons crawling up my back, and grabbing my ass and squeezing it. I would get flashbacks of myself unconscious getting stripped of my clothes by strangers, without my knowledge or consent. How they had to open my eyes with their fingers and tools while they operated on me, and my gaze being blank, innocent, unaware. I'm shaking while I'm writing this. I felt a complete loss over my body, I am 17 now and full relaxation is the most daunting thing to do. I have refused to ever attend services like spas or massages in fear of having to lay facing down naked. I have frequent and intense thoughts of rape and it is one of my worst fears. It's just the fact that I was an innocent girl getting touched by strangers, even in a non-exploitative way, their hands all over my body, then literally opening and slicing and stitching it while my parents did absolutely nothing. Told me nothing. Offered me no support. Avoided me. Left me and every possibility of a good childhood seep into oblivion. I wish I could say I value family, but it is what I fear the most. I'm having trouble expressing this right now but I am hoping you people will have something consoling to say. Thank you for reading this and I appreciate you. I have never been comforted on the matter before.",ptsd
"Trying to Figure Out if I'm a Jerk I had PTSD from a coma years ago. A year or two ago I went through a 30 day 100% sleepless spell. My egg cracked. In the immediate aftermath I had either nightmares or breakdowns or both of all kinds of hellish things where I literally thought I was in hell. It gave me CPTSD. After things were better for me, I sought out help first from a psychiatrist who gave me daytime Prazosin and Buspar which helped a lot. Then I started seeing a psychologist who might be helping already. But as I become more and more me, I'm walking around just agreeing with people a lot less. I don't agree with them so I say so. One of my dearest relationships was with my now-grown nephew. He bluntly told me he was ready to choke me when I was so sick because all I did was agree with what he had just said. It was all I could do. Now I can do more. So I've told him a few times when I see things differently and he gets offended and won't talk to me for a day or two. The problem is, he's 29 years old and only wants to talk about the video game he's playing, the movie he's watching, or the new toy he bought. It's better when we're together, but I never see him in person. On the phone, when he will (I'm not making this up) give me permission to call him, I talk a lot more but he doesn't say that much. I want him to be happy and have the things he wants. But our family is full of people who are having a lot of problems and our country is having a lot of problems, and I get to hear about the 99th remaster of Doom. Who gives a fuck? I asked for permission to talk to him last night and he said ""I really don't feel like it. I had a busy day at work."" I told him I'd try to pretend that wasn't really hurtful and said goodnight. He said nothing and no thing ever since. When you need permission to call, when talking to someone is such a chore that a busy day at work makes you too tired to endure it, is there a relationship left to save? When I was going through my very bad time he barely made an appearance. I had thought of him as one of my closest friends. He said he could tell there was something wrong with me, but i would talk about it. So he just quit coming around. Thanks for caring. Now I feel like, if I lose this relationship, am I losing anything? It hurts me to think about this stuff. It hurts me the way he treats me. We were close until I got sick, then he got bored and moved on. Me and my ex-wife were close until I got PTSD, then she didn't like that I had been so sick so she started cheating on me then left me. When you get PTSD, even if you don't abuse them, do people just walk away from you? How do you even go about finding new people. My world is almost empty. If I'm driving people away to figure out how before there's nobody left. If I have to pretend I agree with everything people say and never give my opinion to be in a relationship with them, am I in a relationship with them?",ptsd

"Attn folk with PMDD: Anyone else here have random shame/guilt arise during their ovulation/luteal times?  Hi folks,

I am reaching out to you as well as the u/cptsdwomen and u/pmdd groups to try and see if this is more than just trauma rising up.

**This post is primarily for women, femmes and all who menstruate** (or who used to) and have un/diagnosed PMDD... pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder - a disorder often co-morbid with PTSD and CPTSD.

*Some context*

I have CPTSD from old stuff, PTSD from new stuff, and PMDD throughout all the things since age 9. I've been through some scary times since COVID and experienced a couple crimes that brutally affected my life within the past two. The legal after effects as well as fallout financially and healthwise are with me everyday.

BUT (hopefully) the worst is over and I can keep plugging away and slowly healing.

What's happening as the outer stuff eases (from complete chaos to normalised hardship), **my past two cycles, I've noticed an old** ***old*** **shame/guilt feeling creep up and blanket me come up from out of nowhere.** Had that happen *lots* as a child. It would take over while at a friends' house or while watching a movie or in an otherwise pleasant, low-key situation.  (Yep, there's abuse from back then too)

I have a trauma counsellor (she's on vacation til end of month). I do all the things (as best I can) and have had to do so since the past two decades when it comes to mental/physical health. So I'm not a newbie to the 'work' and not looking for advice like ""talk to your counsellor"" (because I will :)

*My question* ü§î

**What I am trying to figure out is if others  who mentstruate also notice weird and random waves or bogs of shame take over during otherwise ok moments or within a mild trigger or interaction? Especially during/after ovulation and during the luteal phase?** I need to know if I am alone in this or if there are others finding this happen in there cycle too.....

**If this is relatable, would you be willing to share?** I'm trying to figure out what's happening beyond ""old trauma is coming up, if you don't know exactly what""....

"is it possible to barely even remember what happened? When i was around 6 i was SA‚Äôd. I remember telling my mom, I remember being interviewed by social workers and i remember being a kid and knowing that i was SA‚Äôd, but I cannot remember any details or anything that happened to me for sure?? I have one event that I remember very VERY vaguely as in I almost question its legitimacy (but i know something happened because he WAS arrested). 

Recently, I‚Äôve even discovered that more things happened that I cannot remember at all and didn‚Äôt even know happened to me.

However, I still struggle knowing the fact something happened to me. I still think about it everyday, i struggle with reminders of what happened (smells, places, tastes), I‚Äôve started having nightmares about him, struggling to focus in class, and pretty much every other symptom of ptsd, but I can‚Äôt really remember anything? How is it that i have all these symptoms from something I can barely even recall? Is it still possible to have ptsd?

"Extreme abuse survivor success stories make me feel worse Title sounds awful, but to elaborate I absolutely want people to overcome PTSD and find success, I really do hope we are all able to feel safe and have beautiful futures soon.

I feel bad feeling this way because I'm sure they did not mean to make me feel like crap for not suddenly getting my crap together now that I'm ""free"", and as I learn more about PTSD it's left me feeling like I could never reach anywhere near their heights. Some of the biggest stories involve abuse far more severe than my own, and it makes me mad at myself that instead of creating my own small business and becoming an ""inspiration"" I struggle to get out of bed, brush my hair and feel anxiety talking to a cashier. 

I'm not sure if they never had those years of being stuck, realising they don't have an identity outside of their trauma, lack of drive to do anything and feeling alien from every regular person around them because no one could possibly relate. Did they share their story back then or hide it? Was adjusting to the real world also incredibly hard to do? Were they also emotionally unstable? Did they deal with years of foggy memories and fatigue? Did they also feel more hopeless outside of the abuse? 

Idk, it's just hard trying to find examples of success where it doesn't jump from the worst things I've heard to suddenly having a loving family, living upper middle class and being believed. I would be heartbroken if they were putting on an act, but I wish they would talk more about how long it took to actually recover. ",ptsd

"Almost Died First time posting, hello my name is Paul. I have so much to say, will try to make it as short as possible. Well, let's start at the day of my accident. I work as a maintenance man at a housing complex. The job was to remove a toilet and replace it with a new one. I completed that task and was throwing the toilet away in a dumpster. Somewhere in the process the bottom had gotten broken. The toilet bounced when I threw it in. It slice me write down the middle of my arm, the inner part right at the elbow. I looked down and it was wide open. I grabbed it and started holding it together. Bleeding all the way back to my car. I started asking for help. Someone who was they're trimming trees saw me. She immediately took off her belt And applied it as a turnicate. It was gushing pretty bad. But thankfully she slowed it and I owe her my life. I had lost so much blood.At that point I started throwing up and then lost my vision And also having trouble hearing. When the ambulance arrived. I was in and out of it. When I arrived at the hospital It became one of the worst experiences of my life. Because of the emergency they couldn't give me any pain medication at that point. Because it had sliced me down to the bone and severed the artery. They started sewing it without any pain medication. I felt everything really bad hand pain because of the turnicate. At that point they had started given me blood, my vision started coming back. When they finished with the artery , they were able to give me pain medication. I was kind of in shock at that point. They were actually surprised buy how calm I had been threw the whole thing. I think that to because I was dying. I was told I lost over three liters of blood. People always talk about that. Seeing the light or other things like that. What I saw was a literal flash of my life. I was thinking of my wife and kids. Family and friends I had lost contact with. Family and friends that I had lost ect. This next part, I will make short.It could actually be a whole separate story. I was cleared to work only after ten days. I came back and I still think I was in shock. I lifted a water heater hurt myself again. Then was out another three months. When I came back my employer Just treated me like trash and has been for awhile. I came back with restrictions.  When they were up They came up with minor reasons to give me right ups, to make me look bad. I believe they were doing this to set me up to get fired or something. The accident happened in September 2023. I have all sorts of nerve and muscle issues, And don't have the strength or confidence to find a new job yet or else I wouldn't be here. I've just been feeling horrible about myself. Have constantly thinking about death and the accident. Don't know what to do, or where to go from here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TW: Staturatory/Grooming/Emotional and physical abuse/mention of SA

So when I was 15, I was freshly traumatized from being SA'd by my friend and was quite frankly very messed up. I wound up meeting a guy in high school we'll call Victor. Vuctoe was someone that kept to himself, only had a couple friends, etc. We shared the same (awful) friend group and this started a relationship I wish I was never apart of. Note at this time he was 19, I was 15, and I took of it being wrong but he played all the right cords and every little lie and promise so that I would trust him. I started noticing alarming things when his family member would make comments like ""you'll find better hook ups in college"" and no one corrected the brothers behavior. He wound up convincing me to give up my v card in exchange for his and I'll never forget him and his father shaming me for it and making me make a promise that I would never tell my mother about me and him having sex because in his words ""I would go to jail."" It continued through the years but it wasn't the sex that wasn't the only thing. His parents shamed me for having a disorder I couldn't control and having a menstrual disorder that I also couldn't control. I later found out me not controlling it was because of the extreme stress he put me under. When we graduated high school together, I wound up doing a vast majority of his college work including essays, math work, assignments, etc. During this I was shamed often, locked out of conversations when he got upset and would ghost me, threaten to leave me, and when he'd be ""better"" it turned into love bombing in which I fell all over again because I swore he loved me. He dumped me back in late May and by the time he did, he was abusing edibles because he wanted a ""happy"" feeling. All we did was fight, and when he broke up with me it was like the gates of heaven opened. I felt a lot of weight off my shoulders. However then the harassment started a couple days later. Him telling me he couldn't live without me, that he loved me, that he needed me, etc because I wouldn't respond and just left him on seen. I had to file a police report because he showed up to my house, my father had to get involved to tell him to leave me alone and not come back, it was horrific. Now six months later, I'm in a new relationship and although I'm very happy I am horrified and angry at the things I have seen and the questions that have been answered as to why I felt so bad both physically and mentally. I'm angry almost everyday, I'm writing my ass off everyday in my notes app and never posting, and him and family members of his continue to stalk my social media frequently, and I've now had to block several accounts from both him and his family. I am sick. I am tired. I want peace and quiet without having to feel like I'm so unloveable because someone tore me when I was already down. I wish I wasn't so stupid and shattered as a teenager that it drives me crazy. I feel like I cannot be loved and that I'm not worthy of it. Frequent nightmares of him getting violent and putting his hands on me, etc. I'm just tired. I want to be free from the anguish I went through. I wasn't the best person either but I wish someone understood.",ptsd
"I was honest with myself, and it‚Äôs terrifying. I had an honest conversation with myself. The realization was the most painful emotional thing I‚Äôve experienced. I vomited and collapsed.

I am not alive for myself. I have no will to live. I am staying alive for my kids who live with their mother, I see them two days every other week. I am staying alive for my family, parents, brothers, my sister. Because I know they‚Äôd be devastated if I left. That‚Äôs it. If those few didn‚Äôt exist, neither would I.

I searched for the will. I couldn‚Äôt find it. I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm tired of being told how strong I am for pushing forward. I don‚Äôt want to be fucking strong anymore. I want it to end. I want peace. This world is hell. I‚Äôm tired of promises being broken. The betrayals, the hope that gets fucking smashed to nothing.

I am constantly waiting for the next shitshow to fall in my lap. It‚Äôs my whole life. Every step I felt like a cancer the world is trying to remove from existence.

I want out.

I am in therapy, and it is intense. I have no idea if it‚Äôs working. But I‚Äôm still doing it. But I don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs for me anymore. It doesn‚Äôt feel like it.

"9 in a year. People call it ""fake trauma"" and I need to know if this is true. Amongst my friends, I saw nine suicide attempts in one year. Somehow none were successful, although a few got very close. Now every time self-harm or suicide is even mentioned I just cannot function. I cry, I panic, all that. Or I just close off. I hate it and wish I wouldn't, but it's unfortunately out of my control.

"I feel like I just woke up from a coma and it's horrifying and uncomfortable  Hello, 

I (25F) have cptsd. It feels like the last 8 years were being lived by someone else and it's single handedly one of the worst feelings I've ever known. 

At some point, I believe around 16, something changed and I shut off more than I'd ever shut off. I feel like some other dumb bitch with zero reasoning skills made all of my decisions for 8-9 years and now I'm living a life I'm confused by and scared of. I genuinely walk around feeling like I fell out of a sky ceiling portal thing  and landed here in someone else's shoes. I would never live like this????? But I am! I did it! I'm the one who put me here, allegedly! 

I had a lot of outside influences too. My parents are beyond abusive so I had to escape them first, then I married my husband far too young (against my wishes) and got mistreated even more, then his family decided I should be XYZ at this or that given time, but nothing was ever good enough.

I just need a name or a word for this. Just what is this feeling. What is this trauma process. I wake up in a panic daily because I don't know how to manage it and I'm fucking sick of therapists (THE ""PROFESSIONALS"") going ""uhhhhhhh I don't know but that's weird."" Literally what did these people study in school if they don't fucking know? I'm EXHAUSTED of hunting for someone in the field to get it! I'm tired of explaining it all repeatedly with no results. 

I'm just tired and don't want my life to be this

"Skill that my EMDR therapist taught me and asked me to work on, worked!! I‚Äôm really proud of myself for it!!

Well tonight something happened that triggered me and sent me into a mild panic attack and I tried going to the safe place we created. And it worked!!

"Having trouble navigating my ptsd. *This post could potentially be a trigger for some people.* I have never posted on Reddit before but it seems to be a successful place for connecting with others feeling similar.
My 25 yr daughter had an overdose in March 2024. The overdose led to 4 serious cardiac arrests, 50 mins of CPR including paddles, kidney failure so dialysis was started. She was in a coma for 10 days and by some literal miracle she woke up! The feelings of happiness - there are no words to describe it.
During this time our 6 yr grandson was with us and that was another hurdle to navigate. I was terrified that I was going to have to tell him his mommy is gone. That was heart wrenching beyond words as well. 
My daughter is doing well, sober and working towards having him back with her. I‚Äôm very proud of her progress and support her 100%.

Now here I am and the dust is settling and I am slowly falling into a horrible paralyzing depression. I get things done that are needed but I feel so empty inside, so disconnected and I cannot stop thinking about it all. 
I don‚Äôt know how to feel like myself anymore. I‚Äôm depleted and very disassociated with my emotions and even things like feeling hunger.

"I found out today that my former boss is in jail for r@pe! I don't know how to even react to this news . I passed by the city i used to live in 10 years ago and felt like to go to my student job place ( gas station) . I realised it has changed as if the owners changed. I was happy and full of nostalgia as this time of my life was very exciting, i was moved out to this city so it was the beginning of adulting. The boss who hired me was a bit flirty at first but he never did anything to me . In my opinion he was a narc as he was very manipulating and didn't paid
Me on time . I always had a weird feeling about him but more of "" this person is mean and weird "" and i just didn't want to interact with him . At some point I left and he wanted to remain friends but I just moved to another city and completely forgot about him. 
So today out of curiosity I simply type his name on Google only to find a mugshot pic of him !!!!!!! That he is serving jail time for raping a girl he met online !!!!!! He had 2 Previous cases of harassment !!!! I don't know if anyone have exp√©rienced something similar ??? I just felt like I escaped a predator and it's really scary .",ptsd
"Any more (former) LEO or militairy here?  Hello brothers and/or sisters. I'm sorry if this question is asked here before. Furthermore, English isn‚Äôt my native language. 

I was wondering if there are other (former) law enforcement officers or soldiers here on this subreddit. Maybe we can share some stories about which country you are from, how does your governent, agency, co-workers etc handle your PTSD (√≠f work related) and do you receive  benefits, pensions, treatments etc. 

I feel alone, so i hope to read some stories from ppl in similair situations. 

I'll kick it off;

I'm from NL. Worked in the militairy for 5y, in law enforcement for 18y. Suffered from work related c-PTSD from my time in the police. Worked, amongst other things, as a k9-officer, riot police, first response unit and special guard unit. During my many years on the street i saw a lot of horrible things, i've shot a guy, suffered hearing damages, was assaulted, threatned etc. 

I'm in treatment for over 2y now and will prob. be (medically) discharged in the near future. In my country you will need to be examend by a basic insurance physician before discharge. He/she will decide how many % you are unfit for duty which will correspond with how much benefits you will get. Sometimes a very dishonest and respectless process which gives a lot of stress. This semi-goverment agency doesn't want to pay ofcourse, so they are know for telling ppl to work insane jobs which are not capabel of working. This agency is a lot in the news here lately about how they operate.

Speaking in eating disorder therapy today about how severely i used to punish and treat myself when i was at my sickest with bulimia and my therapist sent a report to my GP and my psychiatrist requesting trauma treatment. 

Can a person be traumatised by their own hands, their own thoughts, what they put themselves through and what they endured from themselves?

"Victim of SA ‚ö†Ô∏è don‚Äôt read if ur sensitive to sa 

four years ago, i think somewhere in april 2020, it was night and i was sleeping. i woke up in the middle of the night to my mom‚Äôs husband touching me. I remember my shirt was lifted up and he was touching my cl!t. I screamed my mom‚Äôs name but she didn‚Äôt hear me. He also left without saying anything after i screamed. I was flabbergasted about what just happened but i went back to sleep. When i woke up, I told my mom about this later after it happened but she didn‚Äôt believe me at all. She only believed me when her husband admitted it like months later. Because of this, i always act like a ‚Äúbitch‚Äù around both of them. Arguing is very common in our household and my mom always blames these on me. She keeps telling me I need to grow up and that it‚Äôs easy to get along with her husband if I just act nice towards him. But im only like this because of what he did to me; anytime I told my mom this, she scoffs it off and tells me that it‚Äôs just my excuse for acting like a bitch. She doesn‚Äôt even side with me. It was four years ago and i haven‚Äôt told the authorities about this but i really want to because it‚Äôs troubling my mind ever since then, and it will probably be like that forever. One reason i dont wanna tell the authorities is bc hes really old and is very sick so i dont want him to spend his last year behind bars. But i might tell the authorities because im getting tired of him always arguing with me and my mom. Hes very verbally abusive. Also i have proof of him admitting he touched me. i js dont know what to do with it. I might tell my school counselor about this but i dont know what will happen to me. My mom will probably hate me and i will probably be sent back to my home country, which i dont want to happen to me. Also, this happened four years ago when I was 11 years old. I‚Äôm scared no one will side with me and my mom and her husband will send me back to my country or do something bad to me. I told my friend if i should tell anyone but he said i should wait till im 18 (im 16 right now). Do you guys have any suggestions of what I should do?

It all started after we got a puppy who I devoted all my time to. Then our neighbors started giving us issues as their constant blasting of music which could be heard in our home really triggered me. I have always been someone who does well in silence. Noises trigger my fight or flight response. Afterwards my mom who is a big source of my trauma reached back out to me but eventually broke my trust yet again. 

Now I have been stuck in this state. I‚Äôm always tired and fatigued at work no matter how much sleep I get. Noises startle me no matter how big or small they are. I always feel like my senses are heightened, and I cannot think clearly. My stomach is a mess and rejects a lot of food I eat now.

I‚Äôm 19, so on Halloween probably around 11-12 years ago, me, younger my brother, my mum and my brother‚Äôs dad (he ain't and will never be my step dad but that's a whole different story) went trick-or-treating, as normal families do. Now, I am probably on the spectrum so when I was a kid, I had a lot of sensory issues but I've worked on them and I'm doing great now. Anyway, we wrapped up trick-or-treating in our neighbourhood and headed over to my brother‚Äôs grandparents‚Äô house so we could get candy from them. So, we get there and I rang the doorbell, and instead of someone opening the door to give us candy, they OPEN THE DOOR AND FUCKING SPRAY ME STRAIGHT IN THE FACE WITH SILLY STRING‚Ä¶ as I said, I was a very sensitive child so I didn't take kindly to that, and that incident basically ruined Halloween for me. Since then, I have decided to skip over Halloween entirely and start the holiday season early. 

I don't know if this belongs here but I thought I would tell the story somewhere, and maybe someone will relate to it, who knows? Some people think it's kinda odd, or I'm rigid but whatever. I don't care for Halloween parties, I rarely ever dress up (and if I do it's a low-quality costume to fit in because I have to), but I do enjoy the cheap candy üòÇ.

"I don't feel like I should be traumatized over what happened to me. (Work-related, long) It's a bit of a confusing story, I can't explain the whole thing without basically making a book. 

Early this year I was at an internship for college (off campus), and had conflict with one of my supervisors on the site. They clearly did not like working with students and did not want me there, but I needed them to teach me/reinforce certain skills to pass the internship, and I confronted them firmly but in as professional terms I could about it. It only made things worse. By their own admission, I was not the first student they had problems with.

Soon after, a piece of my personal property went missing, which I figured was coincidence, but then another one was tampered with. I finally reported the situation to my university. Again, this only made things more tense, and I was getting into conflicts with this supervisor multiple times a day every day.

Eventually, I was accused of cheating on a certain task. I don't know whether it was a deliberate setup or a mere coincidence with how that happened, but regardless, the site reported me to my university. I was absolutely terrified I was going to be kicked out of college. Had a mental breakdown as soon as I left for the day. Fortunately, to my university, the entire situation was suspicious, and I was sent to a new site to finish my internship, and had no problems there. 

For awhile, I thought I'd gotten over it, until these last couple of months. I graduate in December and I am terrified of getting a job in the field I had my internship in, but it's the only thing my degree applies to. I keep getting flashbacks and having nightmares. I keep trying to reason with myself when the anxiety hits, and it works temporarily, but it always comes back. And while I'd never actually do it, I fantasize about purposefully failing this last semester so I can delay getting a job. 

To boot, I did witness something very horrific at the new site I was sent to, at the fault of no one, it was just an extremely unfortunate event. I played Tetris after because I knew it might give me flashbacks and heard that may help. I haven't had any flashbacks or nightmares about that incident and I feel guilty that out of the things my brain chooses to be traumatized by, it's by someone being mean to me rather than something that actually ruined people's lives.  

I just don't understand why I'm so caught up over something that ultimately worked out in my favor. I feel like I need someone or something to smack my head on straight. ",ptsd
PTSD and LSD Has anyone had a really bad trip that feels like it changed their mental status? I am going on a year of having a terrible first and last trip off acid and I have yet to feel normal again. Countless days where I want to just end it all because of how I feel on an existential level. All of my feelings of sadness or horror are just heightened through the roof. I get really nice breaks from it and it gives me hope that I can actually be better one day but my lows are extremely low to the point I get extremely scared of what is going on in my brain. Is anyone else dealing with this or have gone through this before? I want to know what I can do to help restore my mental health or at least deal with what I‚Äôm feeling.,ptsd

"One of my biggest fears came true - I had a flashback in public and a random person was really rude and judgmental I was at a store and saw an upset kid who reminded me of a kid I'd met in Afghanistan years ago, a kid who witnessed something a kid should never, ever witness. I was there too, but I was 19 - the poor kid was 6, if I remember correctly. I can't even imagine how much worse it was for him.

Fast forward to 2024, I see this kid at the store about his age who for some reason looked almost just like him. I don't know what he was upset about, but he was upset about something. I think he lost his parents in the store but I'm not sure. He turned, made eye contact with me, hugged me (or as much of me as he could reach from his height) and started crying. Long story short, I ended up on the floor right along with him, holding him and bawling my eyes out. 

This one lady walks by, looks at me, and says, ""What the fuck is wrong with you? What are you trying to accomplish? You want attention, well you got it - now what do you want?""

I could barely say anything but I managed to tell her that he reminded me of someone I'd met years ago. Something like that. I don't remember exactly what I said. 

She started yelling at me, saying how ""Everyone just wants to play the victim those days"" and all that. 

Playing the victim was the very last thing I'd wanted to do. I just wanted to go to the store and come back home like a normal person. I'm not proud of myself for what happened either, but I feel like there was absolutely no reason for her to be an ass about it.",ptsd
"I do not know what to do.  This is the only subreddit I could think of coming on for some advice, I‚Äôm sorry if this is a waste of peoples time or seems tiny in comparison to the horrific things that some people have been through but I really am struggling.

Before I start I am a teenage boy so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm reacting in what many would call a childish manner. 

Tuesday night I got into a fight at a football match, it was with a person I know from school and I completely deserved it, I was being a dick really and got what I had coming. I use the word ‚Äòfight‚Äô lightly because I‚Äôm not very big for my age and would never purposely get into a fist fight with anyone because it‚Äôs not who I am and I would never win. So he gets about 4 clean shots on me (at least that‚Äôs what I think, I remember one of them but the rest are all such a daze, and in complete honesty the whole memory is a blur.)
I am so stunned by what is happening I‚Äôm not defending myself or anything and I‚Äôm lucky he either hasn‚Äôt hit very hard or it‚Äôs just my adrenaline because I don‚Äôt really feel the shots and thank goodness there‚Äôs no serious damage apart from my lip is now inflamed.

I got home and broke down into tears (bad I know üôà) I was so upset with myself that I had put myself in that situation and just felt as if I had screwed everything up.
I decided to apologise to the kid over text and it was all good he apologised for punching me.
I slept fine Tuesday night but it was probably because I was so tired from all that had gone on.

Today has been the worst, it‚Äôs all I can think about. What will happen at school? (Nothing most likely because we are fine) *I have a week off for people wondering* So I know Sunday I won‚Äôt get a wink of sleep.
The event just keeps on replaying in my head continuously, when I‚Äôm doing daily things. My parents know about it and they told me off last night but today they seem worried about me my mum kept asking if I was ok after all that had happened and obviously I said yes.
The truth is it isn‚Äôt, there‚Äôs a horrible feeling in my stomach every second as I feel I‚Äôve let everyone down and made a bad image of myself.

I decided to go to bed early tonight to try and clear my head a bit however I‚Äôve been trying to get to sleep for hours now but I can‚Äôt because this fight keeps replaying in my head.
It‚Äôs all I can think about, who I‚Äôve upset, my lip, what could have happened, does everyone think bad of me etc.

What do I do to recover?

As stated at the beginning, I am sorry if this seems futile compared to what some people have gone through and I‚Äôm sorry if this is not PTSD in the slightest, I just don‚Äôt know who to turn to right now.",ptsd
"Was I even raped? How do I deal with this betrayal?  TW- Sexual abuse 

Some background- I have chronic anxiety, C-PTSD, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD. I was originally put on an SSRI (Paxil) when I was 10 for anxiety and panic attacks. I'm currently on medications and in therapy.
Both my parents have seen my mental illnesses impact my life and evolve. 

**I remembered I got molested from ages 9-11 by my best friend's dad when I was around 21. He did horrible things to all of us. After remembering, I lost it. I became suicidal, it triggered my bipolar tendencies, it was bad. My mom convinced me to break up with my bf (same man I'm seeing now) and move down to Florida to get some ""help"". I went to the psych ward a few times because of them but they didn't help. They actually kicked me out because ""I got a staph infection""... 

NO! My cousin raped me in my sleep shortly after moving down there. I had my sleep apnea face mask on. I couldn't consent. I just woke up and he was inside me. That's rape, right? 

Every time I bring up the fact that they still talk to and hang out with him they get really defensive. My mom blames me for what happened because ""I should've known better than to spend the night"". She blamed my illnesses and said drugs may have been involved. I DON'T EVEN DRINK ffs! 

I wanted to go to the cops. My rents wouldn't let me. After me making that threat I was no longer allowed at family functions. My dad even forbid me from going to my grandmother's funeral üòî 

I eventually got worse and worse. I was always in hysterics; constantly crying. I would call my mom when that happened because, well, she's my mom. One day she said to me, ""I went to the doctor and he said if I keep talking to you like this I'm going to have a heart attack and die and I'm not willing to die for you."" So, I backed waaaaaay off. Eventually, being unmedicated was too much for me and I couldn't work. I got evicted. 

I HAD TO SLEEP IN MY CAR! SO DANGEROUS FOR A WOMAN IN FLORIDA! THEY DIDN'T CARE! Then I had to move in with an autistic man with mental illnesses who forced me to do sexual stuff for my medications. I couldn't take it anymore and caved, called my parents and asked if they could put me up in a hotel (they're loaded and have no shortage of cash). I had just filed charges for sexual battery and had nowhere to go. I was surprised that they gave me any money at all. They were convinced I was on drugs and basically disowned me for a few years. I wasn't on drugs. I was undiagnosed and unmedicated bipolar. 

Was I even raped?! 
How do I stand up to my parents and tell them how much this hurt/hurts me? That I felt so abandoned, scared, and alone... I feel so betrayed.

But that's besides the point. I started this new job, I've been there for almost a month now, and I can tell everyone thinks I'm an idiot. I can be very scatter brained definitely and sometimes I'm in a daze as work. I wish I could explain why I'm this way but it backfired the last time to tried to be open. It just sucks because I remember at one point people actual had respect for me and were interested in what I had to say. Now I can't even form a proper sentence.

Personally, it‚Äôs impossible for me to untangle the two.

"Just got diagnosed  Hello, I have just joined the sub because today my therapist told me she believes I have ptsd from am abusive relationship I experienced for a few years. It was never physical really just emotional or a few pushes here and there. He cheated on me repetitively without my knowing and sexually assaulted me multiple times. Distributed the videos of us together when I was underage and put me in dangerous situations as well as comparing me to other women and calling me names repetitively. He also kicked me out in nothing but a jumper and left me freezing and stuff like this. Also ridiculed my mental illnesses. I don't want to go to far into it as it's hard enough talking about it let alone bringing up the memories. I never thought I had ptsd I thought I just had anxiety but the more she explained the more I resonated with it although I don't get flashbacks at all. I'm now just a mess sort of sat here like if I had just left him I wouldn't be in this situation. I can't stop blaming myself I feel brutal.

"Tics while eating after traumatic event? I don‚Äôt know if this truly fits here, so feel free to redirect me if necessary. [TW: suicide (graphic maybe?), disordered eating (not eating disorder)] 






So a couple of years back in 2020 I saw a man shoot himself online. I barely remember what it looked like and Kind of forgot I saw it so I guess my brain is pushing it away as much as it can, which I‚Äôm glad about. After that I had nervous ticks making my neck cramp up multiple times in a minute, whenever I thought of it. On that same day I tried to eat a food I enjoyed and started having these tics again, signaling me to stop eating. I ignored it, because I was hungry and was physically sick after for at least 30 minutes. This then repeated multiple times. Over the while the random tics have stopped and only joined up when I feel uncomfortable due to weird sensations or in the eating situations when it decides I should not eat anymore. Now this is really annoying, because often I barely ate a few bites and am still hungry, but know I can‚Äôt eat more or else I‚Äôll be sick. 
Now I was wondering, is there really a connection to the two things? It definitely correlated at the start, but could it still be the same reason nowadays? I do stim after because of the uncomfortable sensation it gives and I have autism and adhd as well. It‚Äôs just really starting to get annoying ^^ could anyone try to explain this in the most rational way possible- (feel free to ask questions if necessary) ",ptsd

*On my sixteenth birthday, I was hit by a car. The injuries were not serious, but I received a concussion and a broken arm. It's been a little over a year since that day. I'm 17 and I think about the accident almost daily. I walk through the place where it happened every day, my injured arm periodically hurts and my brain seems to have become worse at thinking. Very often I can't cross the road, my breathing stops on the street and a stone seems to fall on my chest. But sometimes I cross the road quite calmly and breathe in a relaxed way. I don't have the opportunity to ask for help and I can't figure out what's wrong with me.*

"Insurer won't send me a psychiatrist's report.  Context: over a year ago, an insurer agreed to cover a physical injury but denied any mental injury (despite 3 psychiatrists confirming PTSD).

My insurer then accepted my mental health claim, citing the psychiatrist's report (without providing a copy).

"Yes, checking the mail triggers me badly due to medical bill trauma. (American) I hate checking the mail due to fear of medical bills. The PTSD original trauma was nothing to do with the mail. However, having to deal with the trauma itself, while being forced by survival (here in America) to continue to work while recovering from the trauma with no available rest (mental/medical) period, and not having emotional sense of survival security due to finances has caused checking the mail to become triggering on its own.

I'm hoping to spread awareness that yes, common ""minor"" ""necessities for survival"" can put additional mental burdens on people who are already struggling, so it's not okay to blame people for not being able to excel like people without the invisible burden of ptsd. It's wrong to blame people for seeming to just not be able to ""get it together"".

"I (22F) have an issue that I can‚Äôt seem to share with my therapists. My earliest memory is from when I was around 3 or 4 years old. I can recall it as vividly as if it were yesterday, and it unsettles me. During a summer vacation with my family, I remember going to take a nap with my mother after we came back from the sea. Under the covers, I took off my clothes and remember secretly touching myself. The only thing I knew was that it wasn‚Äôt the first time I had done it. 

When I was alone at home as a child, I would sometimes undress in front of the mirror and touch myself, not even realizing it was a sexual act, because I didn‚Äôt learn what sexuality was until I started third grade. I remember feeling a particular satisfaction from doing it secretly.

Later on, I discovered p0rnography, and it changed my life. The unrealistic body images and portrayals of sex gradually disconnected me from real life. Now, I hate my body and don‚Äôt have a single day where I feel adequate.

For years, every time I‚Äôm alone (even in my first job), I end up touching myself and wanting more and more. But because I hate my body, I don‚Äôt have the courage to enter into a relationship with someone else (this may be the only advantage protecting me from doing things I might regret).

At first, I thought I might be hypersexual. But it didn‚Äôt seem reasonable since it might be related to trauma. When I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 at the age of 20, I started to think it could be related to that (my hypersexuality)

Still, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs normal for a 3-4 year old to do something like this. Maybe it is, and maybe it‚Äôs something normal, but because I can‚Äôt share it with anyone, I can‚Äôt help but feel scared.

Last year, my sister, who is ten years older than me, confesse.d that someone in our family abused her when she was very young. But she didn‚Äôt want to share the details or reveal who it was. This scares me even more, and I can‚Äôt help but wonder if there might be things from my childhood that I‚Äôve forgotten.

I hate discussing it with others‚Äîso much so that some people even assume I‚Äôm asexual. My family thinks I‚Äôm disgusted by sexuality and that I would never be with anyone. But I am far from being that way.

I can‚Äôt share this experience with my therapists because, as I said, I hate discussing sexuality with others.

"I just got recently diagnosed, now a lot of really random things make sense. Hi. I just got recently diagnosed with ptsd. I'm 17f and I am shocked. I didn't think I have ptsd, but I just realized I have a lot of the symptoms such as:
‚Ä¢when I zone out I remember traumatic events from throught my life, I'll regain awareness and it will slow down but I zone out a lot

‚Ä¢I get startled really really easily, I will gasp most of the time but sometimes I full on scream and I flinch really hard from it, unnecessarily hard

‚Ä¢sometimes I just wanna really avoid things. Crucial things that I need.

An example of that is school, ever since kindergarten I've been bullied physically, verbally, and emotionally. I've had some terrible things happen to me at school and the adults don't care so why even be there if it's gonna make me all awful? One of the worst things that happened was a kid pulling a knife on me, it was a light silver dagger with a black handle. The kid never got expelled only suspended.

I will avoid the skatepark too, it's really disappointing because it's one of my favorite places, I've been physically assaulted on multiple occasions there. Adults don't give a shit. They REALLY don't.

 for context, i was like 4 or 5, maybe 6, and i remember this boy who was several years older than me giving me really uneasy feelings as a kid. to this day, whenever i hear his name or randomly remember his family, i get this feeling of dread. that night, as i was talking to my friend, i had this sudden memory (i think) of me being alone with him and him telling me to do some inappropriate things and then i remember a closed door. that's it. i don't remember anything else except having a hopeless and scared feeling afterwards. my friend asked if i was ok and i explained to them what was happening. they were asking questions and i kept saying it felt like i was remembering something but i didn't know for sure. they started freaking out and i started freaking out. it was like we were both finding out i might have been violated when i was a child together. 

after that happened, i started thinking back to my life around that age. i remember my parents saying i used to have severe night terrors when i was little and i would wake up screaming. i also became really sexual and easily aroused at this age. i wasn't having sex, but i was pleasuring myself once or twice a day until i was around 8 or 9. i also would have frequent dreams as a kid about being touched or undressed by strangers all the time. sometimes i would wake myself up masturbating in my sleep. i also remember being really paranoid about locked doors and bathrooms growing up. if i had a play date at a friends house, using their bathroom always made me feel on edge. i felt uneasy around most males growing up, especially my brother's friends, and would avoid being alone with them at any cost. i don't know if i was just trying to be appropriate or if it was me trying to protect myself from something happening again. i still feel wary around most men, but i can't tell if it's just a natural response as an adult woman who is familiar with the potential threat of men, or if i've been carrying a specific fear since i was a kid. the only other symptoms i still experience are the feelings regarding bathrooms and locks. sometimes i'll still have similar dreams as i did back then, but now that i'm older they're uncommon. however, now i'll have dreams about being sex trafficked or kidnapped; occasionally realistic-feeling dreams of just sex. i don't know if it's relevant, but i'm a virgin and i've never watched porn. 

all of these things are coming back now and i don't know if it's because something happened back then or if i imagined it. the past couple days have been me going back and forth between being convinced something happened to me as a child, and then thinking i just imagined the whole thing. i'm already in therapy after experiencing weird triggers and emotional flashbacks as a result from a relationship i ended this year. i've never had any of those symptoms for physical trauma, because as far as i knew i didn't have any until a few nights ago. i have no idea what's happening. i don't know what to do or what's real anymore. has anyone experienced something similar?  what did you do about it? thank you for taking the time to read this i will appreciate any insight.

They didn't come down until the road when I were and I'm not a consciousness bleeding in the middle of the road. They didn't come to the hospital. They didn't call the hospital to check on me. They refuse to come get me after I was helicopter to a further hospital to the trauma unit. How it helped me with nutrition I'm stuck upstairs in the house nobody's taking care of the puppy the right way and so I'm having to push through pain and injuries just to get up and down the stairs to try to get the dog to go out. My friends are showing up and caring and checking in especially my bestie. My cat doesn't understand and I don't know if the dog does either and I don't know how the dog was. I was for sure he was a goner under my wheelchair. Somehow he got loose and ran up to the house. Maybe his Lassie moment?

"Was this a flashback? Difference b/w flashbacks and emotional flashbacks? TW: references to physical/emotional abuse 

For context, my parents divorced when I was five. It was incredibly messy. They would fight constantly, sometimes in front of me, and sometimes it would escalate to where they would throw objects around the house or at each other. My mom and stepdad have been married for over a decade now with a very healthy marriage.

I have a handful of moments like these:

I was recently able to recall a memory of my bio dad pinning me down, holding his hand over my mouth, and spanking me with a belt when I was about 4 or 5 for crying. When I tried to verbalize this to my stepdad, I suddenly felt hot all over. I felt choked up, like I couldn‚Äôt talk or breathe well, and my heart was pounding so hard my stepdad told me he could feel it while I sat leaning on him. 

My parents had an argument sometime last year. My mom and my stepdad are happily married. He‚Äôs safe and he loves me very very much. But that day when I heard them arguing, it felt like I was on fire. I was shaking, felt like I had a hot flash, my stomach churned, and while they wouldn‚Äôt notice, I drove to somewhere secluded and sobbed in my car for 15 minutes straight. I turned off my location and was afraid to reach out to anyone, and the only thought on my mind was that I was alone and that I had to run away. Things weren‚Äôt safe anymore, and I was all on my own.

Are these flashbacks? I was under the impression a flashback meant a literal reexperiencing of an event, sensory-wise. Or can it also happen without recalling a specific memory? When people say they reexperience an event, do they mean externally, or in their mind‚Äôs eye? What exactly is the difference between being triggered and experiencing a flashback, and how would you go about recognizing them?",ptsd

"i need help, please hi, i didn't think i'd be coming to reddit of all places for help but here i am again :'D
this all happened to me when i was around 14-15 from what i remember, right after being sa'd for god knows how many times it's been now, i've lost count. i'm 17(f if it matters) now and ive only just remembered this

this all happened back in high school before i graduated and i used to hang around with this one teacher (f around the 50s-60s age i think) who i frequently had 1 on 1s with since i needed support due to things like my ptsd and autism. we would regularly talk like we were normal friends, but she would be kind of sexual with me every once in a while when it was just us alone together

when i would vent about my sexual trauma or just discussing other things with her, sometimes she would tell me about her sex life with her husband, telling me stuff about toys and kinks, all whilst i was in a vulnerable state after being sa'd. that stuff was normalised to me at the time, so i would engage in the conversations whenever they happened. she never touched me in any way that was sexual, just giving me really tight hugs and sometimes playing with my hair + other casual things. the only thing i could think of that could mean anything sexual was her nudging me when she made innuendos about her having sex with her husband.


she was the one that knew first when i had an issue, or in my school's eyes, being a troublemaker (literally having panic attacks w no support). none of the teachers were considerate when it came to this, that specific teacher questionably being one of them. she was dragging me to a quieter place when i was having a panic attack and physically holding onto me, and i begged her and another teacher not to touch me because of how overwhelming everything was, and so she helped this other teacher basically push me down the stairs and telling me i was a disturbance to literally everyone around me and threatening to call my parents. that same day, i was left in a room with her and other kids and i wasn't allowed to eat anything during lunch. she didn't acknowledge me whatsoever until i apologised

whenever something bad between us happened, i would always be the one apologising and basically begging for forgiveness whilst she gave me the cold shoulder and the silent treatment. i really don't know if this is anything severe and i need to tell my parents, or if im just overreacting about everything. please help, anyone, be as honest as you need to",ptsd

Since we've both become adults, we've been dealing with trying to get obvious adult things (I've been able to register to vote, my sister had to badger my mom about getting her a bank account).

Obviously, since *we are both adults* it is our responsibility to get things set up. Problem is, we're still freshly new adults (I'm 19, my sister's 18) and know barely anything about adult stuff (never were taught how to fucking cook btw, had to do it ourselves).

My parents have also been physically abusive and emotionally abusive so I've realized for a few years that they are abusive.

My question is, is blatantly disregarding me and my sister's concerns about having access to adult stuff abusive? Her response is mostly ""do it yourself"" in a condescending tone. She never offers to help guide us along, she never sends us stuff to look at, just. Do it yourself! You're old enough to know!

The abuse was awful, spitting, throwing my food away, stamping on me, dragging me across floors, trying to suffocate me, crushing my fingers, cut my hair, forced to have sex, chopped my toe off and emotional abuse telling me how fat I was, calling me names, telling me no one would ever love me, I should kill myself etc.


He then turned on our son and that was it for me and I kicked him out, I wouldn‚Äôt let my son go through what I did as a child. 

I then met someone else, he was so different, calming, lovely, gentle.

So, I've been in therapy for 10+ years on and off, mainly crisis support and working through general mental health issues. This is the first time I'm confronting my traumas, and for context I am a CSA and child abuse survivor. 

I feel like I am ready, I want to be ready. I am in a safe place now, but I can't move forward without experiencing PTSD on some level daily. Hence, therapy. We have not touched anything too deeply but it's still more than I've ever talked about it outside of conversations with my partner, or drunkenly trauma dumping to someone who has similar expierences. I guess maybe the seriousness of the setting throws me off. 

I've only had two sessions, in fact. The dissociation feels like a lot more, but at the same time I can't remember what it's like to not have this feeling. I'm more clubsy, can't focus much... I do have other life stresses, so it might not be the therapy. Still, I'm wondering has anyone else experienced this? How long roughly did it last, or is this a sign that I need to stop?

"How My Dog Helps Consider my dog is a rescue dog who was severely abused I am pretty sure he understands trauma a lot better than me. Ever since I have gotten him he has become extremely clingy, having to touch me every where we go, even walking between my legs when we go up and down the stairs. At nights he has to be close to me when we sleep sometimes even on my pillow. He is not a small dog either and has perfected how to take up almost every square in of the bed making it impossible to stretch out at times. However having him there does calm me and I can tell when my nightmares happen bc I wake up to him on the floor watching me.  All in all though next to having a weighted blanket on my bed he does help me sleep a little more calmly.  ",ptsd

"CPTSD finally out of denial, but I hate it  I (F 22) am finally acknowledging what I have but it feels too late. After college, I had to move back home to where the trauma happened and I get triggered constantly. I don't know what to do genuinely I am at a loss and feel like the universe is playing a cruel trick on me. During the last year of college, my Psychiatrist and therapist were making good progress, and around the end, my psych believed I had CPTSD unfortunately I changed insurance and was unable to fully address it. Since then I've moved back home and live in what feels like a house full of landmines.. It's horrible, I can't fully remember what happened to me but my childhood home and someone who lives in the house triggers these episodes constantly. I felt so much rage and fear for this entire summer, and I couldn't understand why. I am not a suicidal person but since moving back home and having episodes of this intensity I say things and do things completely out of character. I don't want to hurt myself or anything like that, but when they happen I am so scared. I have my first therapist appointment on new insurance, but I don't know if it'll help. I tried two different SSRIs and they made me feel worse. 

One thing that is really bothering me is that two people really close to me are taking SSRIs and they are helping them and every time I try and medicate myself it doesn't work or makes it worse. In fact, they are both taking the SSRIs I tried.  (one has major depression and the other has GAD). I am jealous of them. I am in pain and it feels like there's no way out. I have to be here and I can't get out. 

I try to be regimented, workout, self-care, job, etc. but I'm losing my battles lately. The only thing that I feel will ""fix"" me is moving out. Believe me, I've tried but I can't afford it. I am fighting as hard as I can to move out but nothing is working. I am not sure what to do, I am trying to tolerate things till the therapist's appointment.  I really did not belive that I had CPTSD, but after what has been happening to me I can't deny it. I am also horrified that I am this messed up, I dont feel like I deserve any compassion at all for how I behave. It is terrifying to me and the people who love me. I am scared to hurt them.

"FORGIVING Has anyone forgiven the person who assaulted them?? I was physically assaulted by my great-uncle six months ago and I haven't felt the same since. The way I was treated after the assault led me to jumping down a gorge that day, I was lucky I didn't have any injuries thanks to how lush the vegetation was. The shame and guilt that consumed me from the point on feels unbearable and I feel so isolated, the frustration building from being unable to move on from it. I've always struggled with depression throughout my adolescent years but even then I never physically harmed myself, now tho, I find the thought of slitting my wrist comforting, almost cathartic. There's also this unspoken but very present pressure from my family for me to forgive him but how can I? His actions have caused me tremendous anguish and yet I am expected to give grace to a man who couldn't even acknowledge what he did was wrong. My family has brushed this matter under the rug but something vicious in me wants to dig that wound deep and raw, until the blood touches my elbow, I want them to see how fucked up I am because I'm drowning. I can't persue my goals because even the memory of his shadow haunts me and it's suffocating. I cannot find it within myself to forgive him yet and even if I do, he's lost his place in my life. I am truly at a lost in this period of my life.",ptsd
"i get weak pretty easily now. kinda interesting actually. so, quick backstory. i was traumatized at 6, 35 years ago. 2.5 years ago EMDR got me on track to healing. in the past week or so i've been feeling especially weak for no obvious reason. but i was thinking about it today. one of the suspicions i've had about my PTSD is that being stuck in fight-or-flight i've been producing mass amounts of adrenaline and cortisol. i've been running on sheer rage for 35 years. today, however I was especially weak. i don't usually eat anything in the morning nor for lunch. i usually only eat dinner and midnight snacks. but today for lunch, feeling a little weak, i decided to buy a small bag of doritos. oddly enough, after half a bag, i began gaining energy and i had enough for the rest of the day. odd. i think my amygdala is finally shutting down from FOF and my body is returning to normal.

"He admitted to everything I court and they gave him only a warning and <600$ fine Idk how to feel. I wasn‚Äôt r-worded but still it was sex. Assault and it completely changed me as a person. The way trauma changes you is not apparent every day or specific because it fundamentally changes your values and perspective on things.

My lawyer wants to know how much I am still impacted by this because I can get victims money kinda from him, and she wants to calculate how much she can request him to pay me.

I don‚Äôt know what to say. The first month after the incident I didn‚Äôt feel alive. The 6 months after I spent every day thinking about it.

Is that the guys fault, that my best friend chose she didn‚Äôt want to show up in court as a witness? No. But did this entire thing completely isolate me from my friends and family? Yes. Did it make completely sensitive to this stuff to a point where I got a strong emotional flashback from minor things a stalker did to me? I was completely triggered and realised there were things I needed to work on when I was stalked and felt as if no time had passed 2 years after.

"Would you consider these to be red flags when seeing a PTSD/trauma-focused therapist? Should I switch? Hi everyone. First-time joiner, and a long-time PTSD have-r. TLDR: I have PTSD from childhood trauma I had as a kid from heavy bullying and other unfortunate things that happened. After having a neuro/psych evaluation recently, it's been made official that I have PTSD, along with depression, anxiety, and inattentive ADHD. The doctor who did the neuro/psych evaluation recommended a local facility down the street and I made an appointment with a specific therapist since he was the soonest available one.

Here's where the potential red flags come into play:

* I came in, no one was at the front desk, so I sat down and waited. A few minutes passed by and he came out of his office room (he wasn't seeing anyone). He was a little late but I disregarded it.
* I finally came into the room, and it seemed he wasn't prepared for my situation, so he had to log on to his work laptop, skim through my intake forms (didn't know about my neuro/psych report I sent the facility). And he finally sat down on his therapist chair. Not sure if it's just me, but if I were a therapist, I'd certainly want to prepare myself and read through forms/reports from my patient to know the situation at hand.
* He began asking me questions in typical therapist fashion which I welcome, but the kicker here is that I saw him almost nodding each time I would answer the questions! I think he also noticed that I noticed that he was fighting from falling asleep, but that's definitely not something I wanted to happen, intro meeting or not.

I scheduled an appointment to begin EMDR therapy next week with him, and I mentioned this to my wife and she said I should call to be changed to another therapist. I thought maybe I should give him one shot since he may not be a coffee drinker or something, but that's a little wild to me. I feel like I should switch to someone else, but I'm curious what your opinion is on the matter.

Thanks for your input in advance! I wish everyone the best of luck in your healing journey. üíú

"I'm anxious about today  I posted here not too long ago. My husband has PTSD and had a mental health crisis that has led to him having a court date. Today is his pre-trial date. I asked him this morning if he's talked to our heard from his public defender and he said he hasn't. We don't have court for about 3 hours and I'm already feeling anxiety creeping up on me.

I'm prepared for the worst and hoping for the best. The worst is he might have to spend 3 years in jail and pay $15k in fines. That's the maximum penalties for the things he's charged with. The best would be that they just chalk it up to a mental health crisis that he's getting help for and he doesn't get anything more from it than we've already been dealing with.

I know he's stressing and anxious too so I'm trying not to bug him with my thoughts and feelings but keeping it all to myself was too much so here I am, venting on Reddit. I don't know if this is the right subreddit for venting this stuff, but it's where I talked about it before so it just seemed fitting?

"Seeking Advice on Completing Studies with CPTSD Hello everyone,

I have a question about CPTSD and trying to complete my academic studies. I wasn‚Äôt able to submit my master‚Äôs thesis, and now, four years later, I‚Äôm feeling determined to finish because I‚Äôm so close. However, my diagnosis leaves me unsure about whether I can manage to complete it.

I received the CPTSD diagnosis after I initially failed my thesis. To apply for accommodations, I need to describe how my CPTSD affects my studies. I‚Äôm looking for specific exceptions, like extended deadlines, more time, or flexibility on the number of attempts.

For me, making decisions, staying focused, and finishing tasks has always been difficult. When I study, I often feel lost‚Äîespecially since I work alone and lack structure in my life‚Äîwhich can lead to dissociation and anxiety. I get overwhelmed easily, and deadlines now feel nearly impossible to meet.

Has anyone here with PTSD or CPTSD received accommodations at university? How does your diagnosis affect your studies, and are there strategies or resources that have helped you?

"Blacked out and had an episode I think I just need to vent.  I was raped 5 years ago while I was passed out drunk.  In the last couple of years, I've made some progress and have been working hard in therapy to get through the trauma and it's been working a little.  I'm coming out of my shell a bit more lately and socializing more than ever, which has been nice.  But it's still a daily struggle.

I went to a halloweekend party at a friend's house with my partner and my friend R on Saturday night.  We had all been drinking, but I certainly wasn't expecting to get hammered, I just wanted to have some fun.  Another friend made some sangria for everyone, which was wayyyy stronger than anyone realized, including me.  I had 3(!) cups of it within the span of maybe 45 minutes and before I even realized it, I was incredibly drunk.  I remember standing on the porch with a piece of pizza and then nothing, just little flashes here and there.  I like to drink but the last time I got this drunk was when I was assaulted, so I'm not used to it.

Well, while I was blacked out, I guess that was a massive trigger to my body and I apparently had a MASSIVE ptsd episode.  According to my partner and friends, I passed out, then woke up on the couch and started freaking the fuck out.  My friend R was trying to console me while my partner called an uber and they took me home, where I apparently started full on screaming when they tried to touch me to help me up after falling (multiple times) or to take my shoes off or anything.  I woke up with absolutely no memory of this, just a horrible hangover, a banged up body, and the post-adrenaline exhaustion.

On top of this, someone at the party texted my partner privately.  She was asking my partner if my friend R ""kissing"" me while I was passed out was consensual or something she should tell me about.  My wife assured her that there were no kisses at all and that it was just the way he was angled, he was just trying to calm me down and reassure me everything was okay, and that he would never do something like that.  I believe my partner, I think, but Jesus Christ.  I have not been able to relax since any of this happened.  Idk if it's just the kind of emotional hangover from having such a massive episode or if it's me trying to work out how I feel about whatever happened with my friend R.  He was, according to my partner, incredibly good with helping me when we got home and did a lot to respect my boundaries in that state while also trying to help me feel better.  But the doubt that lingers is so incredibly hard to get over.

All this to say I will never trust my friends sangria again, I hate parties and I hate PTSD. ",ptsd

All through it I was very dissociated. She told me that before we ended that she did a grounding exercise with me. I don‚Äôt know if I was very dissociatied after, but I was conscious for 1 second before I was dissociated again. From what I was told it was 30 minutes- 1 hour until I was found( my teacher thought I went down to the office, so that why it her so long to find me) from what I was told that i took me an hour to get out of dissociation and talking. I got out of dissociation but I couldn‚Äôt talk for a good while. And I realized after I came out of the dissociation that my teacher was there. In total 
my episode lasted 3 hours. 

My therapist has told me that I might have a dissociative disorder, she can diagnose me but I am getting a neurological testing done in the future. We talk about a lot of things so it‚Äôs sort of hard to ask her about dissociative disorders. She told me that the dissociative disorder could be with the PTSD or a stand alone diagnosis.

So, I'm broken. I'm completely and utterly broken. All my life I've been used, abused, and hurt. It started when I was molested. I guess it turned on a light switch in my mind and made me both incredibly sadistic and incredibly masochistic at the same time. I was also hit two times as a kid and exposed to a lot of frightening situations. The damage was done fast. Fast forward to teenagehood and then I become hypersexual and start engaging in dangerous online behavior with older men. I wanted to replay the chaos I experienced as a child. And I developed severe mental health issues like BPD and major depression...I became hypersexual and I fell fast. I became suicidal and was hospitalized.

In my late teens, I was sexually assaulted violently by my ex. It was the first violent struggle of my life. I screamed and I kicked and I fought but to no avail. Nobody could help me.  I felt disgusting in my body. I felt violated and horrible. I fell into a deep depression.

Then I ended up in an abusive relationship..He called me names, so many names. And he beat me until my whole legs were covered with thick, dark bruises. I feel a sense of fear when I hear the sound of the belt. Nothing hurt more than the searing pain of the leather against my skin. It felt like it was being burned off. He also forced me to be a camgirl for money. I hated it. I tried, even on cam, and no one cared. There's still pictures of it online. If I didn't do the cam work, I would be beaten or called names. I felt like I couldn't leabe him...

But I did..

Only to fall into the hands of another abuser. He was mostly verbally abusive, but he coerced me by guilt tripping me into sex. He lamented that I didn't want to have sex with him, and he would cry. We got in an argument and I capitulated. I had sex with him and I grinned and beared it. I winced in pain and I felt beyond violated with what was happening to me. He knew I didn't want it..but he didn't stop. I left him...but it hurt. He was the last person I was with (in person) 

I tried to have normal relationships, but it's never worked out. The only people who want me are abusers. I feel broken, unable to escape from the cycle of abusive that I both love (because trauma feels safe) and hate (because I feel suicidal). I want to end my life because I don't want to be broken.

I don't want to fall into the hands of another abuser but that seems to be my whole life. I've forgiven everyone who hurt me and I wish them peace and good things but it hurts being broken. I'm so hypersexual that I spend several hours a day in fantasy, mostly very violent ones, and not taking care of myself. 

It hurts so much. 

I can't take this. I can't stop blaming myself. I feel like I deserve it 

Help me...please....I'm drowning. ",ptsd
Is it possible to be traumatized by something that didn‚Äôt directly happen to you? My mom was shot by her abusive boyfriend in the face and she died February 2023. I didn‚Äôt have to identify her but I somehow had gotten ahold of the ring camera footage and I basically saw it and I went through a point of time where  was stuck watching it. My moms death ruined me in many ways. I think the hardest is living with the guilt and regret that she was homeless and I couldn‚Äôt take her with me and that for years even before her death I was so mean and not compassionate to the fact she was an addict all her life. I‚Äôm six months pregnant now and doing better but I have these days and nights where I feel guilty for moving on with my life and tonight as I‚Äôm typing this I‚Äôm trying to go to sleep and I keep picturing my poor moms lifeless face with the ugly bullet wound in her forehead. I keep just thinking about how scared she was and that she died alone on the street in her car. Left there like she meant nothing ,ptsd
"Just got diagnosed 2 days ago (therapy advice/venting) I‚Äôm kind of nervous.

"New to everything and still not sure if I‚Äôm going mad Hi all,

Very recently diagnosed with complex ptsd from sustained abuse from my parents. I was misdiagnosed for so many years and the painfully vivid memories where it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm back in that moment are driving me insane. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs normal to feel so crazy about the memories and being back in those moments but I just can‚Äôt seem to come back to the present moment as easily as I once did. 

There‚Äôs been a very specific memory that has been plaguing me for years which seems perfectly happy, probably the only one that is a ‚Äúnice‚Äù memory. For some reason, however, I can‚Äôt help but feel extremely on edge and uneasy whenever this specific memory comes up. I can‚Äôt tell you how or why but something feels unsafe about it. As soon as I think about it I‚Äôm fidgety and start scratching at my arms and hands. 

How can I get my mind off of it or any ways to help get me out of the cycle of reliving memories that just end up making me feel scared or worse?",ptsd
"Medication Dependency & Side Effects  I was just prescribed Buspirone 10mg for sexual dysfunction due to antipsychotic medications. I started about a week ago and the past few days I haven't been able to remember anything it seems. I've been forgetting what I'm doing. I forgot if I took my meds this morning. I forget what I'm typing and saying. I'm calling my psychiatrist tomorrow to see if I should stop but then I'd need to find another medication for libido. I have C-PTSD due to sexual trauma and I'm on so many medications I just have no libido. It's seriously affecting my relationship. THE PILLS I'M DEPENDENT ON DID THIS!

I'm also already on Sertraline 100mg and other medications that affect serotonin. I'm worried about serotonin syndrome.

I'm on Clonazepam .5mg up to 3x daily, Gabapentin 100mg in the morning and 300mg at night, Ziprasidone 160mg daily, Vyvanse 50mg, Thorazine 30mg, and Clonidine .1mg daily. There's so many different drug classes and I have no idea how they each affect serotonin. I'm really concerned about what all this stuff is doing to my brain and body. 

I'm well aware I'm on too many meds. But, I honestly don't know what to do. Believe it or not, my psychiatrist and I have been working on trimming this list down and decreasing doses and the list is smaller than it used to be. But, currently, I don't feel like I can come off anything else. I've done ECT (electro convulsion therapy) 2x to try and relieve my symptoms and it helped A LOT! It got rid of my suicidal ideations. But, I'm still a wreck. 

I've really tried to simplify my regimen but even with therapy I don't feel comfortable decreasing any meds at this time. I HATE that I'm so dependent on them! I'm basically addicted to Clonazepam now. I've never abused it but I've been on it for 10 years and when I don't take it I can DEFINITELY tell. I'm so frustrated üòû there have been times when I couldn't afford my meds and I had scary, awful withdrawals. I'm officially an addict.

I can't even get pregnant right now because I'd have to come off my meds and there's just no way. I'm seriously dependent on these psych drugs/benzo and I hate it. I'm worried I'm going to develop dementia early because of this. I HATE PSYCH PILLS!

"How to control what I say when I black out from flashbacks I have comolex ptsd (diagnosed by professional therapist 3 years ago I no longer have) because of an abusive relationship i am no longer in. I was single for two years and content


I started dating a wonderful person who we've discovered also has ptsd (undiagnosed) we trigger eachother. Its horrible. I remind her of her abusive parents and she reminds me of my abusive ex (but only when we're triggered)


we have 2 day long fights once a month on average. I get triggered and say something that triggers her and its just a stupid domino affect. We know we dont mean what we say when were in this state and I can deal with it but she cant.


She told me either I have to control what I say ""This relationship is horrible for me"" - for example, when im triggered and upset, or shes going to either 1. Kill herself or 2. have a heart attack. She doesnt want to leave but she fears she might for her life


Our ptsd outburts were getting better until she got in a car accident back in february. She broke her leg and has a buldging disc in her neck. She is always in extreme pain and needs cannabis for survival. I think this might be perpetuating some of this but I could be wrong

I support us financially and understand this isnt her fault. But we were only
together 6 months before this all happened. The only time we dont fight is when we're high 

I need help. Almost everyone I talk to tells me to leave her and im a saint. She isnt my responsibility etc. But if I do she will be homeless because she cannot work. She will actually kill herself. But now she will too if she stays with me. She has no family who can watch her


and I love her


if I can control myself when we have flashbacks we wont have problems. Maybe she can learn to control herself too


Please help me, I dont know what to do

"Can PTSD ever reach full remission? Without giving y‚Äôall my life story (this ain‚Äôt my blog lol) I lost my aviation medical some years back due to a combination of physical and mental ailments.

I‚Äôm doing worlds better now in both departments, with most of my conditions in remission. However, Transport Canada says they want every single one of my conditions in full remission before granting me my aviation medical back.

I‚Äôm not sure anymore if this is realistic. They specifically singled out my PTSD and said it must be stated by a physician to be in full remission ‚Äúfor a period of time‚Äù before even considering letting me fly again.

I have been doing regular therapy and working pretty hard on myself but given what I now know about PTSD and how it affects the body‚Äôs nervous system etc etc, idk anymore if this is a reasonable goal for myself.

"romantic trauma ruining my relationship  romantic trauma causing issues 

so for some context, im in a relationship with my fianc√© of 3 years we‚Äôre polyamorous and recently started seeing (not dating) this person, i‚Äôm not looking for advice or criticism on polyamory, that‚Äôs not the issue here.

so, to make a long story short my past two relationships before my current fianc√© was absolutely traumatic, i have cptsd and those two relationships are major trigger points for me. i really struggle with portraying romantic affection or affection in general due to it, i only recently managed to start actually being romantically affectionate to my fianc√© due to it. 

anyways, onto the problem, both me and my fianc√© are developing a bit of a crush on this person but there‚Äôs an issue. i‚Äôm jealous- not jealous because of my partner being romantic and stuff with another person, i‚Äôm jealous because i can‚Äôt do the same with the person? 

i can‚Äôt be romantic with them at all due to my romantic trauma, it makes me really uncomfortable and to a degree disgusted but at the same time i crave affection and the same things that my partner and our third person is showing eachother.

i like both of them so much and want to be able to show affection and be romantic to them even if just a little bit i really don‚Äôt know what to do in this situation?

the tension it‚Äôs causing me personally keeps causing me to subconsciously find stupid minor things to get angry with and i keep causing issues with the third person and stupid arguments. i really need advice on what to do to get over this romantic trauma and stop being so uncomfortable and making myself upset

"The difference between feeling aroused and feeling anxious  So I need some advice maybe some input here can help me. A lot of my trauma stems from SA and before my current relationship I never had a positive experience with being intimate. 
I am however in a healthy relationship for 6 years already and built a lot of trust and my partner and I are sometimes intimate. 
We have signals that I can give when I feel uncomfortable or anxious or anything to stop, so I can feel safe at all times and all that really helped me to open up. 
I noticed that there are times when I feel good and safe and I want to continue but I am not sure if I am about to have a panic attack. 
We always stop but that is very frustrating because it‚Äôs happening while I feel like I want to continue, but my heart is beating fast, I feel weird in my stomach and very tingly. 
Yesterday I thought about it and it bloomed on me that those could also be symptoms of just being aroused and I thought maybe there are some signs that could help me distinguish between anxiety and arousal. 
So if you know any differences focusing on body reactions (I really need to stop before the mind chimes in, because otherwise I will have nightmares and flashbacks) between those two that would really help me out. ",ptsd

The past few days I‚Äôve neglected my schoolwork because I‚Äôve been too hyper-fixated on this, but the difference is now it‚Äôs almost an enjoyable event for me in some weird fucked up way? Or maybe it‚Äôs a form of self harm, forcing myself to like what happened to me, while also letting it eat me up inside?

"C-PTSD: had a HORRIBLE year, was betrayed by a best friend and went through a hard period, but am determined to turn over a new leaf (includes a retelling of a specific event) **WARNING: THIS IS A LONG POST**

I grew up in a cult and have severe c-ptsd.

My childhood was full of physical violence, emotional abuse and gaslighting. Somehow, I still managed to finish both high school and college, got a job and moved away from home. I'm 25 y/o now.

I was always top of my class (an overachiever), but gave very little attention to my appearance (I had severe acne for 10+ years and just stopped trying to cover it up at some point). After college, I got rid of my acne and started putting effort into my appearance, but did it more to fit in than from genuine self-love.

When I was 24 'the year of doom' happened. I thought I had finally become a functioning member of society, but it turned out that I had gotten myself into three very bad relationships/situations:

\- I became best friends with the most unhinged woman I had ever met (but she hid her true self very well).

\- I was in my (second) romantic relationship with a man who mistreated me. (Hid his phone, talked with past flings, almost never did anything nice, let his friends disrespect me, constantly played me songs about men cheating on their girlfriends... But was the sweetest ray of sunshine when we had first met.)

\- I ended up working a job where the boss was a wuss and allowed my co-worker to put me down repeatedly. (And would then get extremely offended once I had decided to quit after a year.) They have had a problem with this particular individual for years (many people have quit because of her attitude, some even after a few days of being there), but have not fired her, as she knows more about the business than the boss himself.

After the incident with the 'best friend', though, I went through an episode of rage and self-hatred. I had first tried to commit suicide before I even started attending elementary school and was luckily unsuccessful. Then that need subsided. Until that 'year'. After that I tried again. **I'm absolutely not trying to say it was her 'fault' specifically, there were just too many things going wrong at the same time and this was just the proverbial 'cherry on top'. Had it not been this situation, it could have been anything else...**

**If you're interested, keep reading. Otherwise, please click away.**

**Here's the story (hopefully short enough without losing context):**

I had met my best friend in college. We were acquaintances for a long time, but became very close in the year after I finished school as she had kept inviting me out to events. She was the sweetest person ever. She not only introduced me to her entire friend circle, her fiancee, but to her entire family as well. In the entire year from the moment we started hanging out until her wedding she had NOT ONCE done ANYTHING that would rise suspicion. I did notice a possible mean streak once or twice, but we all slip up sometimes, so I just brushed it off.

I had never had a close friend, only people I went out to lunch with. The cult had taught me that hanging out with people outside our religion would take me away from God. By the time I met her, I had been an atheist for a few years already. But I knew that I had a problem with being too trusting. I kept my walls up with her and didn't wanna let her in too easily. I didn't overshare. I didn't self-deprecate. I just was. I thought I did everything 'right'. But she still turned around and hurt me once I had finally let her in. I think this is why I got so pissed afterwards.

So, after the 'honeymoon' year we had, she got married to her fiancee. She asked me to be her maid of honour. I was ECSTATIC as I truly loved her as a friend. I also felt proud of myself as I interpreted her request as me 'having made it' as a member of broader society. I was finally 'normal'. And despite my shitty relationship and job, I still had my wonderful friend who would always be there for me. She had at one point even said to me that 'she would always protect me and love me and that I was her soulmate'.

So yeah. Some time after the marriage, I'd finally had it with my boyfriend and I dumped him. I wish I had done so sooner, but he was my first 'real' relationship. (My first boyfriend had a severe porn addiction and had consequently become impotent because of it, which made the relationship very... hard to sustain.) She flipped completely once I was single - which was weird because I was also single when we first became friends. After the breakup she wanted to meet up with me to 'offer me a shoulder to cry on', but then just interrogated me the whole time.

What happened next all went down in a span of two months. She couldn't stop talking about different men lusting after her (her professor, acquaintances, random men on the street). When we were alone, she suddenly started acting as though she was single, always checking who was looking at her and twirling her hair. She also started making small, hurtful jabs at me and came up with very creative backhanded compliments. She implied that my ex-boyfriend secretly liked her, continuously repeated that 'it was obvious that my ex never loved me', tried to set me up with men she knew secretly had a thing for her, even tried to invite herself to a blind date her husband tried to arrange for me. She obsessed over how 'good' or 'bad' the guys I was getting to know were (i.e. their physical appearance, job etc - she wanted to know everything). She then even started insulting the size of my breasts. I had, understandably, decided to cut her off.

However, my new boyfriend (who she didn't know about for a long time) told me to talk it out with her like an adult and I agreed as I thought that I had nothing to lose. People close to me also told me that people sometimes have a crisis after they get married (especially if they get married young - she was just 22 y/o) and that she would probably get over it. I also didn't want to lose a (previously very good) friend if there was still a chance to mend things. Well, the talk did not go well. She was incredibly gracious at the time but (of course) deflected everything. Good old gaslighting. Then she became very cold towards me, but only when she knew we were alone/when we talked on the phone.

Soon after she and I had the 'talk', I had naively decided to give her a second chance and agreed to let her and her husband meet my new boyfriend. I suppose she really wanted to meet him as she had still been relatively nice up until the meeting. During the meeting she talked with a cutesy high-pitched voice and flirted with my boyfriend (in front of her husband) so aggressively that he had concluded by the end of the evening that the two were in an open marriage. At some point that evening the two of us were alone (the guys had left to get us something to eat) and she posed inappropriate questions about me and my new boyfriend's sex life. After I had diplomatically answered them she got annoyed and said that her boyfriend has an enormous penis and that she orgasms 6 to 7 times per round. She then clarified that she only told me that so that I 'would have realistic expectations for my sex life'. Talk about insecure.

After that meeting, I avoided her like the plague, deleted all my social media and decided to try and fade out of her life. I didn't want to make a dramatic exit, as I suspected that she may be a very vengeful person. But I had promised a mutual friend that I would come to a very casual birthday celebration of hers a month prior and I did not want to go back on my word. However, once I got there, the two women did a weird spiel talking about my boyfriend without letting me interject. I suspect they had made plans to do so beforehand, but even if they hadn't... my 'best friend' went 'off-script' either way. She literally couldn't hold herself back and said that my new boyfriend had a 'small dick'. The only person who even remotely tried to stand up for me was her husband. I stood up and left and blocked all of them immediately.

I thought that was the end, but two weeks later she suddenly started calling me from random numbers at ungodly times. I knew it was her, because who else would call at 8 AM on a weekday or on a weekend afternoon and then not leave a message if it was so important. But one fateful Sunday, my boyfriend picked up my phone, because he believes in always answering the phone no matter what. He didn't even recognize her by her voice but she immediately went and slid into his DMs after I had blocked that number too. In the DM she accused me of 'having used her for friendship until I got a boyfriend' and of me hurting her so severely that she NEVER wanted to have ANY kind of relationship with me ever again, but she reportedly still wanted to know 'why I had abandoned her'.

He poignantly told her that he was surprised that she had the guts to say that I was the bad friend and even more guts for writing to him after what she had said about his penis. She then started profusely 'apologizing' while also hammering home the point that I was the one who had 'misunderstood' her comment. But once he refused her proposition of another meeting, she flipped the script and said that she had actually never said that his penis was small and that I was the worst person she had ever met. That I would leave him too one day and that he would be sorry that he did not heed her warning.

My boyfriend then told me to maybe write to her one last time - to close the chapter, not for any other reason and I decided to do so. I tersely summarized the worst things she had said/done to me, but said that I still wish her all the best in her life. I also asked her to never contact me or my loved ones ever again. The reply I got was the most disgusting and hurtful attack on my being I had ever experienced. She said I am so rotten that she did not wish me well by any means. That I am 'intellectually impaired' for not understanding the things she had said and that she had NEVER insulted me once. She also got indignant as I had written in my message that I would rather have no friends than abusive ones and she tired her best to insult my very ability to be a good friend to anyone... I don't care to go back and re-read exactly what she had written, because I had managed to forget some of it and will hopefully someday forget it all.

That was the end of the 'fairytale' friendship. After a year of love bombing, the relationship was irreparably destroyed in two months. However, she has kept the social media post she had once made for my birthday on Instagram and Facebook, acting as though we had never fallen out. In that post she, ironically, calls me 'the best person in the world'.

We may be very attractive to abusers but the more we stand our ground, the further we will have made it in our journey. Believe in yourselves, respect yourselves and (most of all) be gentle to yourselves. I too suffer from constant re-counting of unpleasant events, rumination, over-explaining and hyper vigilance.

"Reconsidering medication Recently I've have several large triggers that have disrupted my ability to get through daily tasks and take care of myself. I'm now re-experiencing previous traumas that haven't bothered me very much for years up until now. 

I'm currently in therapy with someone that I feel I've made a lot of progress with up until this point, she works with somatic and energy medicine, very big on how trauma is stored in the body, and we do some IFS/parts work. 

All that being said, the parts work and energy medicine is not getting me through the worst of my anxiety anymore. Previously, it would help stave off panic and anxiety attacks, but now I'm drowning. 

I had an old prescription of Klonopin (from around 4 years ago) that I caved and took last night, and it's the first genuine relief I've had from being constantly triggered in over a month. It's made me start to consider if I should be getting back on an as needed anxiety medication. I've previously been on a variety of different medications and Klonopin was the only one that offer real benefits. However, before all this I had been considering getting back on ADHD medication as well, and I worry one would interfere with the other. 

All this to say, I'm thinking about trying to get back on Klonopin, but worry about how it may impact the progress I've made without medication, as well as if it would interfere with ADHD meds. 

Thank you for any advice you may have to offer!",ptsd
"I‚Äôm just so tired I just wanted to sleep in 20 more minutes in hopes I could have a better dream, that I could make the flashback nightmare go away, I used to have them so often and I still have them frequently but not most nights out of the week and I had a bad one last night, one I haven‚Äôt had often in years, and my client/mom (I‚Äôm a caregiver) keeps coming in my room and asking me things and making commentary while in there about how I need to tidy up and so I just decided to get up, I was mad I ranted to myself I shed a tear or two and moved on and laid in bed on my phone after getting dressed to try and relax, I felt fine I left my room to cook and the trash and are just full from my client and idk how she does it but she fills the trash SO often and it‚Äôs hard for me to take out as a disabled person myself and I let her come with me as she always wants to but i really enjoy having alone time doing small tasks as a 23 year old who doesn‚Äôt want children (this job feels very much like having a child, same tasks/demand but different age) and it fucking falls over and eggs crack all over and shit and now I have to pick it all up and so I being done even though it‚Äôs legit 9 am I start crying and just telling myself I fucking hate this shit and she snaps and tells me it‚Äôs not the end of the world. I never fucking said it was the trash itself isnt a big deal, it‚Äôs having nightmares that I can‚Äôt get out of my head and having to wake up AT WORK constantly and have to make someone else meals I wouldn‚Äôt eat both as I don‚Äôt like those foods /I don‚Äôt eat breakfast, to then do all their dishes and sweep and mop and never get any real days off.

"I don't understand/relate to my diagnosis. Any resources to help?  I was originally diagnosed with PTSD in 2019. I kind of related back then but I felt like I have gotten better than I didn't qualify for the dx anymore. I got rediagnosed last Wednesday. 

I have multiple instances of abuse and SA as a child/teen. So I get why they say I have PTSD but I don't understand the disorder that much I feel. Looking straight at the diagnostic criteria I don't relate to all the criteria.

Is there anyone that can help me understand more? Any resources out there? I may just not know how it actually affects me since I have so many other diagnoses. To clarify I'm not asking if I'm misdiagnosed or not, just for a better understanding of the disorder.

"had to help save my grandmas life (TW: hospitals, medical emergencies) I‚Äôve lived with her since I was 11, she‚Äôs like a mother to me. She took too much medicine and passed out and stopped breathing. I had already taken my night meds so I was very out of it. I already have a c-ptsd diagnosis from my parents and some other childhood experiences, but I think this was genuinely traumatic for me.

I had to help her breathe, and call 911 and help her since she was partially seizing. Her face was purple and blue. I haven‚Äôt gotten the image out of my head since.

I just turned 18, and I‚Äôve never had to experience this before. They asked me all these questions and I was so confused and lost. 

All my neighbors were outside and saw us and me sobbing. It feels dumb to be more affected by this than her, since she feels much better now after some help in the hospital. 

My bio mom, who I do love but she just has issues and isn‚Äôt fit to parent me, showed up and just fell asleep immediately and then left. I was up for over 48 hours straight. 

Today I feel so foggy, almost high. Like my brain isn‚Äôt here. People are saying I‚Äôm talking different, my stutter is worse. I haven‚Äôt showered since and I can‚Äôt bring myself to eat. I just have no appetite. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. I don‚Äôt want her to know since she already feels bad about it, and it‚Äôs not her fault.

"Cutting off family 
Cut off dad not sure how to feel.

Don't really know where to start, abused by mother and father as a child, physical, emotional, whatever it happened. Just lost my job due to restructuring and I am stressed as hell, but my mothers gone and my dad on his way out, I have a 14 year old sister. ( all this just for context ) 

But space created room for our relationship to be okayish with me and my dad, unfortunately memories resurfaced recently that has made that allot harder. My whole life I have been invalidated in my feelings being told it was just discipline and I was a difficult child, he has never apologized seriously always in a manner in which he truly doesn't care. I've got PTSD and BPD diagnosed at the current moment with the additional depression and anxiety mixed in.

Now to get to tonight:

Essentially I get a call from him typically an every 2 week event and he starts speaking on mental health as he has recently gone through a near death experience and (he is also now super religious)  suddenly believes you can have mental health problems, he speaks on how my mother gave me mine and I correct him saying that both were very much involved. He then switches to how its my fault that I turned out how I did, that I feel angry all the time and am not exactly a joy to be around 24/7. He then asks for examples I give them, things like how he grabbed me by the throat and pushed me against the wall and screamed in my face while I complained I could not breathe, or him attempting to break my arm because he felt disrespected (in front of family members who are apart of this cutoff) Or him kicking down my door because he was angry at me and couldn't open it correctly thinking it was locked.

At this point he began to say he has no regrets and is done apologizing for the past, I mentioned he never apologized seriously once. (Not sure it would matter tbh) He claimed it was discipline and mentioned I was a smartass and difficult child, I then brought up my sister whom has not had to experience this at more than 30% to my knowledge, and she is just like me because she spent most of the time with me, he claimed its different (thank god it is because if she had to suffer as well I'd have lost it).

But then after I said ask anyone outside the family what it sounds like to them and see what they say, at that point he said I am done with this you can choose to make yourself suffer have a goodnight.

Not my finest moment I just said ""get cancer"" and hung up.

At this point I've begun separating myself from social media with them and cutting off all lines of communication with that side other than my sister who completely understands why I am doing this.

I cut off my mom as a child and it was easy, haunted me later on like years later. But why does cutting him off feel so wrong like I am making a mistake even though all he brings me is anger every time he talks to me he says he is gonna die with no regrets, which I know its wrong but it irks the hell out of me.

I haven't ever felt validated or like what I went through was truly as bad as it felt, every day walking on thin ice hoping to not piss him off for something so small. I still to this moment am wondering if I did the right thing and don't know where to go from here, what if they try to contact me? What if he does end up passing? Do I show up for my sister or save my mental? 

May not be the place for it but I am struggling I am not gonna lie, I cannot see a therapist till the 7th and I only get 12 free sessions and now that I have been termed a week before I got benefits I don't know what to do.

Don't really know if I am venting or asking for advice I am just so tired, this week has been hell for me.

Thanks for any comment given.",ptsd
"can ptsd be caused by a suicide attempt?  hi guys! 

to get straight to the point, i attempted suicide last year and it was a very horrific experience for not just me but for everyone else who had to see the aftermath 

i won‚Äôt get into the specifics of what i did or what others saw, but to paint a picture the aftermath looked like a crime scene. 

i find that i have flashbacks of the noise the attempt made, what i saw was happening to me, the screaming, and going to hospital shortly after. 

i noticed that whenever i bring this experience up, or just in general think back to it, it brings me to tears and my heart starts racing and it‚Äôs almost like i lose sight of what‚Äôs in front of me and i‚Äôm transported straight back to that night

"C-PTSD, Intimacy Issues, Ketamine Therapy Hope it's not TMI but I'm desperate. My C-PTSD (from sexual trauma) has been AWFUL lately. I haven't been able to be more intimate than just cuddling. This has been going on for like 2 months. I feel awful for depriving my partner of intimacy but it just makes me so nervous. I hate having sex. I hate sex. I'm not interested in it in the first place because I'm on so many psych drugs. Low sexual function is a side effect so I just started taking Buspirone 10mg to help. I'm in therapy and am debating starting ketamine treatment to help with the overall anxiety I have associated with sex along with helping my depression, and forming new healthy habits. 

What should I do? I don't want this to ruin my relationship. I have a very safe and open relationship so I never feel pressured but he gets depressed if we wait too long. I've done EMDR therapy for my C-PTSD and had an awful experience and refuse to ever do it again. My current therapist and I are doing cognitive and dialectical behavioral therapy. I've even done ECT (electro convulsion therapy) to deal with my PAST suicidal ideations. It was a miracle for that but I'm still depressed. Does anyone have any supplements or remedies to help improve libido? I'm clearly open to trying things.

I was also wondering what effects ketamine would have on C-PTSD. I've done research and the company I'd go with starts their doses at roughly 20mg daily. I asked the live chat about interactions with my medications and they said there were none. 

I'm on Clonazepam .5mg 3x daily for chronic anxiety, Vyvanse 50mg for ADHD, Sertraline 100mg, and Lamotrigine 150mg 2x daily for bipolar. Some of the resources I found implied that there COULD be interactions but I'm not sure if that depends on the dose or not. Thanks so much for your help and advice! ",ptsd
"I wish I could just quiet my brain, I don‚Äôt recognize myself anymore  I was diagnosed with CPTSD almost a year ago exactly. It gave me a lot of insight into my thought process and how/why I am the way I am. Still, there was no real before and after or symptoms (not to my knowledge). I had always been that way. It was just before and after being able to describe them though a diagnosis.

Then five months ago, a traumatic event happened, a violent death. It's difficult because both the perpetrator and victim were family, so there's equal parts of loss and betrayal.

Now I have a true delineation of before and after. Even if I had PTSD long before this, I had a lifetime of finding ways to hold onto my own identity amongst it all. Now I barely recognize myself.

I'm really struggling right now. Treatment is a mixed bag. Medication has helped ease my nightmares and I'm drugged enough to get through the nights more or less. But during the day, my mind is so active. I think of everything that everyone around me might say, think, or do. I don't want to be caught of guard. I don't want to be vulnerable. This ranges from being ""prepared"" mentally in case a trip turn to the grocery store turns deadly to wondering if others close to me are planning bad things.

I love my partner so much that love doesn't seem like a strong enough word. I am tremendously grateful for his companionship, his partnership, and the strength that both have endowed me with. I have always trusted him and he has always validated that choice back tenfold. He is the only person I feel physically safe around right now, even though I judge myself for being frightened that others may harm me physically for no reason whatsoever.

There's other ways my anxiety is suddenly manifesting though with regards to our relationship. He's been my rock and has picked up a lot of slack in helping me take care of even the basics-- making sure I eat, things like that. He hasn't pulled away. He's held me close. But now he'll be sitting next to me, doing nothing suspicious, and my mind jumps to wild conclusions about the longevity or security of our relationship. I've lashed out with sudden frustrations that don't adequately respresent my everyday state of mind or perception of our relationship. I've spiraled. 

I'm not working anymore. I'm grateful to be able to take some time off. I'm receiving short term disability. Which leaves me with quite a bit less per month than I usually made at work, but is helping me to try and ""focus"" on recovery.

The free time is also detrimental though because I just can't stop thinking. I just wish I could turn my brain off and rest. It's so hard to be present. When I manage it, im able to enjoy brief periods of life but then it all gets lost again in the chaos. I just wish it would be quiet.

If anyone has any advice, please let me know.",ptsd

"I had a SA repressed memory come back after waking up from Anesthesia  It's difficult to start this off without sounding outlandish or weird but the impacts of this repressed memory coming back after waking from general anesthesia has completely altered my reality. It's been difficult to discuss openly since nobody has openly expressed something happening like this. I've generally been known as an engima in the health field but I feel so alone in all of this and a part of me is in continuous denial. This memory was something completely random as I was never aware of having being SAed. I've had my suspicions based off certain elements such having a weird anxiety when people go near my back area. So I was completely put off guard with this new found information.

To give some context without being too personal, I am a 22/F was having a procedure called a cystocopy conducted that involves the inseration of a small tube up urethra in order to examine the bladder. Due to the invasive nature of this surgery the doctor had decided to put me to sleep while doing the procedure. As someone who's done a few other procedures in the past, I've never had any issues with general anesthesia and wake up from it in a great mood. These other surgeries were not in the private areas however, which I believe may provide some additional context. 

After the surgery was conducted, I had woken up, felt the pain in the gential area and instantly had a memory of being being violently SAed. It was a very quick glimpse of this memory before my brain shut it down as quickly as it appeared (I saw a quick glimpse before It was instantly hidden). Now....while feeling the pain of the procedure and having the memory occur, a series of other physical stimulus started to occur which sent me spiraling all in the matter of seconds.

 I want to make a note that when I look back to this occurrence it felt as though every response was subconscious.

Anyways, after feeling the pain, seeing the memory, I noticed I was unclothed and the thought of ""not again, not again, not again"" was surging through my head. Then I noticed the liquid that was all over my body (water from cleaning) I remember saying ""who did this to me?!?!"" And proceeded to look down to see my thighs covered in yellow stains (numbing agent) thinking I had been marked from the assault. Essentially I was reliving and feeling everything that had happened to me within the memory.

After all of these things had occurred (which all happened in a matter of less than 2 minutes) I tried to physically remove myself from the bed and head to the bathroom. A part of me was trying to flee (fight or flight) and the thought was I was now tampered with and needed to clean myself in order to purify. As I gripped the handles, while swinging side to side because I was still high, a nurse ran over to me confused as to why I was trying to get out of my bed. I was of course silent and told the nurse repeatedly ""I NEED TO GO TO THE WASHROOM."" The nurse sadly was dismissive of my request and tried to make me urinate in a pan. I kept repeating to her that I needed to go to the bathroom, in which she reluctantly had moved the bed and navigated me in front of the washroom, where I proceeded to continue with my inner turmoil. 

IThese emotions and the reliving of this trauma was ongoing for over 3 hours.I ended up shaking/trembling subconsciously the entire time. I didn't know it was that long until I was notified by the nurse in the ER I was in recovery for that long. I even remember the doctor trying to speak to me but I was unresponsive and another nurse coming up to me to ask if I was alright since I was in COMPLETE distress. It has been impacting my ability to live and my therapist believes I've developed severe PTSD since it completely altered all elements of my life. I am recovering slightly but the constant thought of it being a fake memory plagues me and the constant anxiety formulated after experiencing this has impacted my ability to function. I don't know what to do but I just don't want to feel alone anymore. It's hard to discuss since nobody understands it so I decided to turn here. Any thoughts are welcome.",ptsd
"I‚Äôm sad, mad, and have a lot of anxiety. It gets severe Trigger warning : assault, death, loss

My boyfriend was killed in our home 2 months ago.

The day before his family came over for a drink. It was out of the blue, drugs were involved. It was the 2nd time his family ever came to visit us in the 3 months we lived together. We had been in a relationship for 6 months and knew each other for 8 months. The day before he was killed, we planned to have a drink just the 2 of us, as I mentioned his family came over unexpectedly. His sisters, his brother and his mom. We were having a drink and I ordered for some more. I didn‚Äôt want to share theirs so I decided I would stop drinking around 11pm maybe 12am and wait for the alcohol I ordered. It never arrived. When I stopped drinking, I went downstairs to sleep with my children. At some point around 4 or 5 his mother came downstairs and threatened to kill me and my children, that she was gonna comeback and burn our home down. So I called my boyfriend on his cellphone, from downstairs to where he was upstairs. I cried to him and told him what his mom just said. (Apparently she says things like that alot when drinking). He came to comfort me and one of his sister came downstairs as well to reassure me. They told me they wouldn‚Äôt let anything happen to us. They went back upstairs to continue to drink. Shortly after, I heard some noise coming from upstairs. I thought they would settle it on their own. But it kept going, so I went upstairs to check what was going on. 3 of his sisters were attacking him and he was fighting as hard as he could back. He was outnumbered. I saw one of his sisters pull out a knife and she began stabbing him. I couldn‚Äôt stop it and it all happened so fast. His chest was covered in blood. There was blood all over the walls and our bed. They finally stopped attacking him and on the way out, they warned me not to call the cops. But as soon as they walked out of the house, I locked it and called the ambulance. I was scared to call the cops. And I also didn‚Äôt know how serious his wounds were. I told him I‚Äôm going to call 911 and he agreed. That‚Äôs the last time I heard him say anything. 911 operator told me how to help him, to put pressure on his wounds but there were so many. The shirt I used filled with blood, his shirt filled with blood. The operator told me the ambulance was outside but when I went to check, they were treating his sister for a less serious wound. She stole his ambulance. It took the operator and the paramedics 10 minutes to work it out that she wasn‚Äôt the victim that needed help. 10 minutes was a lot while he was bleeding and in pain. His blood was filling his lungs, which I didn‚Äôt know at the time. I found out later when he passed away at the hospital. In between all that time, I had no idea when his other siblings and mother left. Or how the fight even started. All I knew is he fought for his life til the very end and he protected me and my babies. Our babies, he called them and raised them as his own. After the ambulance finally showed up to help, they began working on him, while I had to make sure the children were okay. The police showed up and the girls tried to frame me so I was detained. I was put in handcuffs and had to sit in the back of the cop truck while my boyfriend was dying and our kids were downstairs alone. What a nightmare. They asked me what happened and I told them my point of view. They handcuffed his 3 sisters and put the killer in the back seat with me. They let me out and uncuffed me. I was able to go back inside to try to be by his side without getting in the way. Eventually they stabilized him enough to transport him to the hospital. He later died, not enough oxygen to his brain and his heart couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. I went to tell his family and from there everything felt so unreal. I got to be part of the planning of his services. For which I‚Äôm grateful. 2 of his sisters were charged with manslaughter and 1 with murder. The 2 were released and the 1 is currently still in jail. A week after he passed away, the day of his funeral it all hit me. But I still felt numb. I felt numb for a week and a half and then the anxiety came. It felt like I was going to die all the time for any little reason. I still think that even if my heart races a bit that it‚Äôs the end, or if I get a random sharp pain, that I‚Äôm gonna die. It‚Äôs terrifying. I was on anti-anxiety meds for 5 weeks, prescribed 7 Ativan and I have been in touch with my therapist who I‚Äôve had for 2 years already. But after the 4th week of meds, I decided to have a drink. 2 missed doses and drinking too much messed me up so bad. My anxiety was at its worst that it‚Äôs ever been in my whole life. For a week straight. I was so scared of everything. I called the ambulance to get my vitals checked and they reassured me it‚Äôs anxiety. It‚Äôs just a nightmare. As of today I‚Äôve been okay for a week now. But today I had some anxiety and realized it‚Äôs never gonna completely go away or go back to normal. It‚Äôs always gonna be there. Just like the grief.

I‚Äôve had to shorten the story quite a bit. So many details but unnecessary to mention. I miss him so much, he was the only man willing to step up for my babies. I wanted to marry him, I wanted our life to be long together. His got cut so short. And this experience made me so scared to live life. Fearing that I will die. I used to be so careless about my life. I almost miss that, it was better than being scared all the time. It‚Äôs going to take a long time to heal from this. I want to be able to help others in the future, to let them know they aren‚Äôt alone and they‚Äôll get through it. ",ptsd

Recently, I was diagnosed with ptsd with dissociative features.

It‚Äôs been pretty heavy, but the good news is I‚Äôll be starting emdr therapy soon. I had a few questions for anyone else experiencing this as well. 

1) how long do/did your disassociation last?

2) while in intense disassociation, is it normal to have hallucinations? (Mostly for me it‚Äôs auditory, and it‚Äôs always random words. Occasionally I‚Äôll see things, but I‚Äôm aware both are hallucinations. Even though I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm gonna lose that grip)

3) if you‚Äôve done emdr, did it help?

I was alone in my apartment, just me in my pets, for a week and a half, so afraid at first we wouldn‚Äôt be able to get enough food or water. We had no power for 13 days, no cell service at all for 3 so I truly had no way to know if my parents who were trapped by fallen trees were alive or not. We had no running water for almost 3 weeks. Several towns are now gone, and reading yesterday that had the dam near me failed, I would likely be dead along with everyone in its path has just worsened my PTSD anxiety to a level it hasn‚Äôt been in a long time. I‚Äôm also a nurse at the hospital here and was back at work the Monday after it hit, so not even a break. We didn‚Äôt have running water there so we bathed using buckets. Work is still the only place I can get a shower. 

I am anxious about everything now. I go from obsessing over what if my pets and I had drowned along with tens of thousands of people to panic about the election (which was already stressful) to panic about things just so far out of my control it‚Äôs crazy. I did okay during the disaster, somewhat, but it‚Äôs just all hit me and I am trying to cope. Sleeping is proving pretty difficult with nightmares about drowning. How can I ever feel safe in my home again? 

I have an appointment with a therapist this coming week and I don‚Äôt even know how to talk about it. Condensing my OCD/PTSD history and explaining how I feel now just seems so overwhelming but I know I need to go. My anxiety now that the gravity of the situation is hitting is just awful. I don‚Äôt want to be crying a couple times a day and afraid to sleep in case something happens. Even light rain is terrifying for us now‚Äîit starts and my friends are panicking too because the last time it really rained left whole towns as rubble and killed so many people. 

Thanks for reading‚Äîany suggestions as to ways to relax and cope temporarily would be wonderful. I will keep my therapy appointment and I‚Äôve also ordered a trauma journal too. I appreciate anyone who read this. ",ptsd
chronic pain?  sense i was a kid i‚Äôve gotten chronic headaches and migraines also pain in my back and neck. a few yrs ago i was in an abusive relationship which made my ptsd worse and the pain got even worse i get pain in my face now too. idk how to cope w it what do yall use or do? ,ptsd
"Mum told me ‚ÄòI‚Äôll tell you if your flashbacks are real or not‚Äô This happened the other day. I told her that my therapist mentioned my body is ‚Äòforcing me to process‚Äô my childhood trauma. Because of this, I‚Äôve been having flashbacks or kind of visions/physical sensations 20 years after the event. Long story short police were involved and they never found out if anything actually did happen to me because I was so young and wouldn‚Äôt talk about it. I still don‚Äôt know if anything happened to me, and so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just overreacting. My therapist said it doesn‚Äôt matter if the flashbacks are real or not, the fact is I‚Äôm having intense reactions to them, and to deal with how to cope. I reiterated this to my mum, who then told me that because she was an adult during the time and remembered it all that I can come to her with these flashbacks (and she doesn‚Äôt mind if they‚Äôre really uncomfortable to talk about) and she can say whether it happened to me or not. I find this weird, as one of the reasons she started drinking for most of my life is that for 4 years she never knew what was happening to my sister at the time, and so she blamed herself for it. I find it a bit rich that she now knows everything and can discern whether something happened to me or not. Anyway I dunno I might be overreacting, I know she meant well‚Ä¶

"Is ptsd from weed possible?? I'm not a regular consumer of weed but I've taken an edible a few times.. not much (dumb teen...I've learned my lesson) . I haven't used in over a month and both of my last two times I greened out. So you know the feeling of the panic attacks  and mind craziness you get during a green out well at random times through the day I get that exact feeling for no reason at all and it feels the exact same as my panick attacks from when I have previously greened out. Like just out of no where I get these mini panic attacks that slowly start to build up like my hearts heating up or something and I'm gonna pass out and idk why. So it just makes me feel like I have ptsd from marijuana because b4 my last time consuming, this NEVER used to happen to me and that was a main reason i don't consume marijuana anymore... sorry this was long....pls tell me someone can relate.....üßçüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",ptsd
"Working through trauma amidst triggers I am almost two years out from my main PTSD-triggering event. I have been working with a therapist and a doctor and taking medications. Every time I start to feel good and think maybe it is time to try more than talk therapy (EMDR or WET) I end up facing a trigger out of the blue and get thrown into a trauma response. When I'm in these trauma response head spaces, I don't think it would be productive or healthy to put in more trauma processing work. 

TLDR: Is there any advice on balancing trauma processing work between flair ups.

I am scared about my diagnosis and need advice please hi I am a young adult female and I was sexually abused and now I am really not well. I dont eat much I hurt myself and my emotions are a lot.

I have gotten mad sometimes at people and im really distressed but most of my anger is toward myself like I just hate myself more than anything else.

"I wish I could be normal again. I don‚Äôt want to be this way. I‚Äôm angry at the people who excluded me,abused me,raped me when I was still so sweet and young and innocent.

"Does anyone happen to be a parent to your own parent?  M20. Me and my mother live poorly, even though we are always in touch with other family members, even dad's side. Mom's kin isn't really all suppotive because they're either as poor or just don't really care about us. My mother could always contact with dad's kin, even himself because they are kind and actually caring and supportive to each other (they divorced when I was 3 because ""they don't fit each other as a married couple""). But she seemed to do this very rarely. We both went and still go through unpleasant financial problems (which only get worse and she doesn't even realize that). 

I understand that mother suffered from her own parents, that her father has gone when she was still young, her mother doesn't care about her etc. In fact, I was unable not to know that because she states her family issues every second time she breaks down which is a lot. She finds it normal to make her son she just screamed on comfort her.

And these breakdowns weren't mere screams, ‚Äì they made me unable to comprehend any normal quarrel or trouble because they seemed like a regular conversation in comparison. I thought that such humiliation was normal. Only recently it was shocking to me to even listen to someone's mental problems, I didn't even think people could be troubled so easily. I couldn't find one, ONE amusing or at least somewhat not frightening story I myself experienced in my childhood, couldn't remember a single moment I felt truly safe. But I do recall a lot of people asking me if I'm all right when I was simply standing or sitting, I turned out to never feel free neither. 

I undoubtetly was born without a goal of parenting but only means of calming herself. That childish, irresponsible brat! How come she finds it acceptable to be calmed by her own child and not the other way around? How does she want me to be empowered, to even want to live when almost everything she does is let me down and give nothing in exchange of suffering her tantrums? What the hell is she thinking? 

She heals with time, however. It's disgusting to admit her current state is not even her worst. She belittled me in my childhood as much as one can belittle another. That she's broken does not excuse her in the slightest, why making a child in such conditions to begin with? Why is it that she depends on me but I would rather starve to death than contact to her ever again? 

But, my life keeps going. I'm not close enough to dad and mom's family tree is a clusterfuck of unhealthy people and people who try to fix it. I prefer to just consider myself with no family at all. I believe only after I get rid of them all I can finally enjoy my life. ",ptsd
"Family wants to take a roadtrip So a little over a year ago I was in a horrific car accident, my coupe ended up under the trailer of a semi truck, I had to get surgery, I am still in physical therapy, and in mental therapy and have been diagnosed with pretty severe PTSD as a result of the collision. 

I am originally from Indiana (currently living in Texas) and my family wants to roadtrip to my hometown for Christmas. I‚Äôve tried voicing that I am extremely anxious about being in a car for 18+ hours, on highways that are plagued with semi trucks, and are just typically pretty busy. 

My family keeps saying ‚Äújust don‚Äôt worry‚Äù & ‚Äújust sleep the whole way there‚Äù (even before this accident I could never sleep in cars so I doubt I‚Äôd be able to now.) I tried to look into flying instead but it would be $800 to fly, and that‚Äôs wayyy out of budget for me. 

A huge part of me wants to stay home, but I don‚Äôt want to spend Christmas alone.

What should I do?",ptsd
"Needed a place to talk  Hi all

First time posting to this thread. 

Lately, as in the past four weeks or so, I‚Äôve been struggling a lot with my PTSD. 

It‚Äôs like an unwelcome relative that comes for a visit every so often and messes up everything around it. 

In 1998, when I was 13F, I experienced a traumatic event. It took me about 7 years to seek help. Luckily, I found an amazing provider who was Harvard educated and was one of the few people doing EMDR therapy at that time in my area. She was phenomenal and truly saved my life. I was in a bad way when I went to see her, very self destructive. The EMDR literally saved me from myself. 

I went onto college, then grad school, got a medical degree, began practicing at a large company in my field just outside of Boston. 

While there, I broke up with a longtime boyfriend. Went back to dating online. Met someone, and sadly had another traumatic experience almost 20 years later. This second time was much worse. 

I tried to hold onto to my life at the moment. I was in denial it had even happened again and tried to brush aside the physical remnants of the bad event, tried to keep pushing on moving forward. But my performance at work started failing. I was making mistakes. I wasn‚Äôt myself. I couldn‚Äôt focus or concentrate. Nobody knew. Then I got sick. It was awful. 

I quit my job and moved into a family beach cottage. Away from the city. 
Tried to regroup.  

I was drinking again - now at the beach cottage.  I eventually realized I needed to admit to myself something had gone wrong - something had happened to me. Again.  

I felt humiliated and ashamed that I could have ‚Äúlet this happen again‚Äù.  I sought out treatment, help again. And this time I knew where to begin. 
EMDR. 
Found an amazing specialist. She was expensive, but worth it. I went 2-3 times a week. I started working on renovating the cottage. I worked on starting my own practice in this new location. Started to live again with purpose. 

I work on many of the PTSD symptoms that were stopping me in my professional and personal life. She showed me how much I was dissociating and how often I would be triggered into panic attacks. She taught me how to ground myself. And the EMDR worked. It helped me admit what happened. Then start to heal. I still couldn‚Äôt work yet, but I was getting better. Then covid happened. 

Fast forward a few more years, I‚Äôm still not back to working medical in my field.  Taking care of others the way I would want to show up for them and be the best provider I can be - seems impossible when I‚Äôm so deeply broken still. Damaged. Or that‚Äôs how I feel. 
I will go back to it someday. I hope. 

But now, this year I have a partner and a little boy. The three of us and our little dog make up our happy little family. We love each other deeply and we‚Äôve been able to spend so much time this past year together, watching my son grow and learn. 

But the month of October can sometimes be hard. Some years it is not, like last year. Some years, it triggers bad memories, nightmares, anxiety attacks, drinking benders, and dissociation episodes that seem unavoidable. 
And now I have my little boy. 

This month has been hard. I‚Äôve been drinking more than I realized.  10 AM and I want to crack a beer open. I don‚Äôt - but I deeply want to. But why? There is no threat in my life right now. No major stress or impending doom. I‚Äôm content and happy on paper. 

Thank god my partner is so understanding. It is one of the things that we share in common. He has C-Ptsd from an unsafe unstable childhood. So when I tell him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not okay right now, but please don‚Äôt hug me. I don‚Äôt want to be touched. I just need some time to readjust. I will be okay. I always am. Just please make sure our son is safe in his play area right now, so I don‚Äôt need to worry about where he is.‚Äù 

He immediately understands, no questions asked. He helps me the way I need the help. I‚Äôll do the same for him. 

I isolate. That is what I do when I feel my PTSD rearing up again. Isolating makes me feel better. But also makes me feel guilty. These days in October in New England are some of the most beautiful days we get. And I wanted to enjoy this beautiful Saturday afternoon outside with my baby boy and partner - but I just can‚Äôt today. I just need to be inside. In my room. In my bed. Resting and trying to calm down my nervous system. 


Ground yourself. 

Repeat your mantra ‚Äú You are safe. You are safe. You are far away in time and space from that day. That person who hurt you is not here. They are far far away in time and space. You are safe. You are safe‚Äù

"How to cope with continuation of anger and nightmares  F20 and got out of 2 abusive relationships, one a best friend and the other my partner. Almost a year ago, my best friend was going through a traumatic time and drove incredibly recklessly with alcohol in her system and me in the passenger seat. I didn‚Äôt know she was drunk until it was too late (I being 19 at the time didn‚Äôt have much experience or knowledge behind what drunk behavior would look like.)

She was screaming the entire time, got pulled over going 90 mph and got off with a warning because she was sobbing hysterically (The cop that pulled her over came to our passenger side since we were on the highway, which is probably why he didn‚Äôt smell the alcohol. I wish he would‚Äôve so I wouldn‚Äôt have had to experience any of what she did to me.) , saying she felt like she was gonna crash her car, saying delusional stuff to strangers in traffic whilst stopping, made me drive after she promised me she wouldn‚Äôt do that because I have EXTREME driving anxiety and I had no idea where we were, then proceeded to drink more alcohol in the passenger seat and when I told her to stop she said it was just water, kept being on her phone whilst driving even after I begged her to stop, had the music up way too loudly so we couldn‚Äôt hear the directions when I tried to turn it down, swerving, stopping in the middle of city traffic for along time to find her vape, and was just really disrespectful to me the entire ride. I keep having nightmares about when she was driving me over the bridge and acting crazy. I thought for sure she was going to swerve us off. 

Sometimes I can still smell the alcohol and hear the things she was saying. She did a bunch of other more messed up things, and in conclusion, had a whole month to apologize to me but never did. I gave her a home to live in, took care of her pet, drove her places, and quite literally took care of her. The fact that she put my life in danger, treated me absolutely horribly and just never apologized, and then proceeded to participate in a kiss with my partner is just a pain I can‚Äôt ever get over. The fact that she called me fucked up for calling her out and saying she‚Äôs disgusting for not apologizing to me makes my blood boil. She apologized for my partners behavior, but not hers. I didn‚Äôt deserve what she did to me. 

She kept making the excuse that ‚Äúshe was dealing with extremely heavy things.‚Äù . I was also dealing with trauma but didn‚Äôt inflict more on her. I always have nightmares about her and I feel like I‚Äôll never be free. She follows me everywhere and I just want her to leave my mind. She was nothing but a horrible friend to me, traumatized or not. She ALWAYS put men first and discarded me and what I‚Äôve been through. When I was sobbing because of what she said to me, she was laying in bed with the random stranger she invited in her house instead of me. She didn‚Äôt care about the pain or trauma I also experienced. She didn‚Äôt care how she scared me when she punched the bathroom wall, or when she would constantly bring up porn and sex and I begged her to stop because I had my own sexual trauma. It was always HER trauma that mattered more. 

When she asked me where I wanted to sleep and I said her room, she said ‚Äúoh well actually the boy wants to sleep with me tonight,‚Äù that hurt me badly. I feel my anger suffocating me about the entire situation. I want peace and I  want to be free from the nightmares. It feels like I never will. I understand she felt bad, but that doesn‚Äôt excuse her treatment towards me and the fact that she didn‚Äôt apologize. She could‚Äôve owned up for what she did, but she instead chose to pretend it didn‚Äôt happen and blame it on her trauma and my partner (who was also in the wrong.) I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôve had residential care for 3 months and intense therapy. I feel at a loss.

"I can feel my brain and thought patterns literally changing  I live in Israel (let‚Äôs keep it civil please, I‚Äôm an individual and a human being and shouldn‚Äôt be held accountable for the actions of my government) and I‚Äôm having a really hard time. 

Even though I live in the center, and not up north where there‚Äôs alot of drama, I am under tremendous stress at all times. When I‚Äôm at home, I have to have suitable clothing on so if there‚Äôs an air raid siren I can run to the neighborhood shelter at a moment‚Äôs notice. I have a go bag for my boyfriend and I, waiting under our bed to be taken with us to the shelter, and we‚Äôve had to bring it with us many times, without knowing if we‚Äôd ever see our home again. 

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where we don‚Äôt bring the go bag with us to the shelter or even leave our house for every air raid siren. Via our emergency notification system, we can see if what‚Äôs coming is a hostile aircraft, or missiles, and we can act accordingly. We only really go to the shelter when we‚Äôre told to stay in a safe place until ‚Äúfurther notice‚Äù like during the second ballistic missile attack from Iran a few weeks ago‚Ä¶ 



There are a few stand out moments that I still have flashbacks of: Last winter there was a terror attack in my city, I was home alone and I ran out of my house to lock my gate, and bolt my windows. I turned off all the lights in the house and hid under my bed as terrorists stabbing people and running people over were literally on the street outside of my house. I called my parents who were outside of Israel for a trip at the time, and I spoke to them for what I thought could be the last time. 

As I mentioned previously, a few weeks ago there was a large scale ballistic missile attack from Iran, and I really struggled. The whole day things were tense and we were hearing rumors. My boyfriend and I were in the park with our dog when we heard explosions in the distance, which is not abnormal, but added to our growing fear. We then got word that the IDF has told all citizens to stay ‚Äúclose‚Äù to a shelter until further notice, and so we went home and waited. Just when I started dinner, our phones went off with emergency notifications that we had never seen before. Usually it‚Äôs something like: ‚ÄúMissile Attack. Head to safe room and stay there for 10 minutes‚Äù it takes 10 minutes for all the shrapnel from the missiles destroyed by the iron dome to fall, and to protect people from the shrapnel, they recommend staying in a shelter for that amount of time. But this time they didn‚Äôt tell us what was happening, just to go to a shelter immediately and stay until further notice. We grabbed our dog and our bag and went to the shelter. There were no air raid sirens, but we could see our neighbors heading to the shelter as well, carrying their guns, herding their kids and dogs down into the shelter. I tried to call my family who live on the other side of town, but the phone lines were down completely, and that‚Äôs when I started to have a panic attack. We sat on the floor in the corner of the shelter and I laid my head in my boyfriend‚Äôs lap and felt the walls shake with explosions. I didn‚Äôt know what was an interception and what was a fallen missile. I didn‚Äôt know if we would come out of the shelter in a few hours and see a wasteland, or if we would ever come out at all. Later my parents showed me a video they took of two missiles landing simultaneously a few kilometers away, and I watch the video on repeat now, I don‚Äôt know why, maybe to torture myself? 

There are air raid sirens more and more often lately, I‚Äôm a nanny and I can‚Äôt take my babies out of the neighborhood anymore; I used to take them to the library, the pool, the park‚Ä¶ Now with every step I take while pushing the stroller, I tell myself ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the building I‚Äôll run to if there‚Äôs an air raid siren‚Äù and before I even pass said building, I‚Äôm already looking for another one that will be a better option for when I pass it. I don‚Äôt put the shoulder straps on my baby so if I need to grab her quickly, I can just slide her out from the hip straps and not have to fumble with buttons. 

My boyfriend and I were going to visit some friends in Tel Aviv, I went to put on heels and I looked at my feet, realizing that if there was a siren or a terror attack, which are becoming common in Tel Aviv lately (I was at the scene of a shooting a few years ago in Tel Aviv, before the war) I wouldn‚Äôt be able to run and I might fall, which could cost me my life. 

My heart sinks and my ankles feel weak when I hear a loud motorcycle, when a car slows down beside me, when I‚Äôm home alone‚Ä¶ I get so afraid to take a shower in case there‚Äôs a siren and I can‚Äôt get dressed fast enough. 

The way I plan my life, the first thoughts that come into my head when someone walks close to me on the street, when I have to take the bus, when I hear a loud noise, when I wake up and I‚Äôm not sure where I am, show me that I‚Äôm not the same person I thought I was when the war started. I live in flight or fight mode all the time, and I‚Äôm scared that if I survive this, and everything goes back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù I‚Äôll be forever afraid.

"Newish SA and other trauma PTSD diagnosis I (25f) got diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD earlier this year.

I am an unreasonably self aware person. I know when I am not doing things that I should. I know when I am burning out, but honestly even though I am self aware I am not always good about dealing with it in healthy ways. I went looking for my ADHD diagnosis after doing a ton of my own research and so when I got that diagnosis in my head all I could think was ‚Äúduh, tell me something I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù And boy did they. 

My therapist a couple weeks later asked if he could give me the PTSD test, he didn‚Äôt call it that but I cannot remember the name for the life of me. I agreed and at the end I got my firm diagnosis. He literally told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to say that you have PTSD.‚Äù  Needless to say I was in shock. For me my trauma was just a thing that happened to me and it was never like I went to war so why do I of all people have it. 

I ended up stopping going to my therapy sessions (I know, I shouldn‚Äôt have done that), and I ended just spiraling and thinking about how my life was not bad enough to have PTSD. Then I started actually thinking.

I started thinking about the 4 times in my 25 years of life that I have been SA‚Äôd, one being at 3 yrs old. As well I started thinking about how my biological mother was an absent drug addict and the only mother figure I‚Äôve ever known (not my biological mother) overdosed. And how my parents made me be the adult and their mediator at 13. And I started to realize that these aren‚Äôt normal things. But I genuinely started stewing in them and it started to cause me to spiral.

My struggles with sex and intimacy very recently killed a 5 year relationship and I don‚Äôt know how to feel healthy and good about it. I have always been open and talked about sex but hid the part of me that was uncomfortable with it. The partner that I was just with was the first person I was with that I didn‚Äôt have to have some sort of vice like alcohol to be with. I don‚Äôt know how to make myself comfortable with sex.

I really need advice. I‚Äôve been avoiding this but I can‚Äôt keep avoiding it anymore. Any advice is appreciated. As well idk if I‚Äôm ready to go back to therapy yet in all honesty. My main question is how can I work to have a healthy relationship with sex?",ptsd

With a person I trust‚Ä¶ I CANNOT cope being in a room with 5+ people I know well. Major anxiety. Desperately finding ways to get out of it. 99% of the time I will absolutely flake. Usually make something up. 

Although, I CAN be around 1 or 2 people I know well. As long as it‚Äôs just us. If I CANNOT have confirmation that it will be just the people stated, then it‚Äôs a no from me. 

I‚Äôd happily live this way but I know it upsets people who care about me. I just flaked from my cousins daughters christening, but I actually gave the legit reason why. Usually I‚Äôd make up a lie but I decided to tell her how I‚Äôm feeling and I‚Äôve been left on read. 

How am I supposed to make others understand how I feel when I don‚Äôt?! ",ptsd
"Defense Mechanisms I have been doing a lot of self-reflection and trying to understand myself lately. And I started to question something about myself that I never quite understood and then realized that it was a defense mechanism: telling my business to anyone and everyone without it being that awkward oversharing way.

Once upon a time I used to be very private and guarded. Then I was in a very bad relationship to put it nicely. I mean he‚Äôs the reason why I‚Äôm here in this community with you all. Homeboy would constantly threaten to blackmail me and tell everyone all my secrets. There were some that were basically life ruining things. 

Ever since that ended, I guess I‚Äôve taken on the mindset that if I tell everyone my business then nobody will be able to do that again. Nobody will have any grounds to blackmail me. I am an open book. Want to hear about my deepest darkest secrets? No problem! And this defense mechanism is certainly one that I‚Äôm actually glad for, in an odd way. I never get embarrassed about oversharing since there IS purpose behind it. 

What kind of odd defense mechanisms have you all developed from trauma?",ptsd

"Does anyone else feel like their ‚Äútraumatic event‚Äù isnt real sometimes? <<CW: Themes of death/abuse/SA>>
I‚Äôm a psych student (I know, irony) and obviously I pay attention to anything I learn about trauma. Despite it ruining a lot of my life, I do find it interesting and I hope I can help others one say. However, this means I also read the diagnostic criteria for PTSD a lot and Criterion A always throws me off.

Like I get what I went through sucked. Specifically there are 3 events that I think led to my problems with PTSD. And yeah most of my teenage years I dealt with abuse that I thought I would die from, but it was rarely physical just a lot of threats and psychological abuse. And in the other cases like yeah I could have been actually hurt, but I wasnt, again just threatened and harrassed (i think is the right word?). I saw a lot i shouldnt have seen and I felt alot I shouldnt have but I think the lack of actual directness bothers me maybe? Like it should have been worse to make me feel like this? I read other stuff and unintentially compare, and I know I shouldnt, but I always feel like im overreacting when im ‚Äúfine‚Äù. At least until the intrusive memories come back or i flinch at a similar looking guy and then I think im valid until i get ‚Äúbetter‚Äù again for a gap. Its also really frustrating that ive been through objectively worse experiences, but they dont bother me at all. Like whats up with that???

It makes me think what i went through wasnt real or actually traumatizing (even though its been ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù by professionals that it was) but i still have to deal with all of the issues that came along with it? Its really frustrating. Especially because I know if someone told me the same thing happened to them I wouldnt think they were overreacting. But for some reason I dont feel that way about myself. Obviously I wish that it didnt happen at all, but if it had to why couldnt I actually feel like it was real and not be stuck in this middle ground half the time. Idk, no one else I know seems to understand or feel this way. I was hoping someone else may have a better understanding on here.

Thank you for reading this far. I just needed to tell someone because its exausting going back and forth like this.",ptsd
"Bad nightmare: my abusive ex and the death of my mom suddenly coincided I have cPTSD because of the death of my mom (15 years ago), and trauma from losing my cat who was my life support after losing her (7 years ago), then I was an abusive relationship for three years (2 years ago). Literally all my dreams were really bad nightmares since I was a teen, my mom was already really sick back then, and EMDR, about 5 years ago, helped a lot. I now still have nightmares most of the time but not every single night and they‚Äôre less intense. I also know what triggers it, horror movies and anything to do with anything paranormal, so I stay away from it.

Well, I think I found a new trigger and didn‚Äôt realize how bad the trauma from my ex was, because I watched Woman of the Hour on Netflix on a serial killer in the 70s and basically relived that movie with my ex as the serial killer in my sleep just now. Normally my nightmares about my ex and the ones about my mom (and cat) dying are separate dreams, but this time everything came together in one nightmare and it was so awful. The whole dream I had to prevent my ex from killing my two current cats, and it ended with him killing both my parents in front of my eyes üò≠

I honestly thought I wasn‚Äôt as traumatized by my ex as I am. In therapy we discussed EMDR after I got out of that relationship but things seemed to got better, but this dream made me realized how I‚Äôm always looking over my shoulder in real life as well. I hate waking up like this and I also hate having another trigger, because I like true crime shows. I absolutely loved my mom, and she never did anything to traumatize me, it was just the situation we were in together. But my ex definitely did actively try to hurt me, and it‚Äôs just so scary to suddenly see all of that trauma come together in one dream‚Ä¶",ptsd
"Remembering, then everything falls apart again.  Last Thursday, I had a conversation with a mental health working in the hopes to pick up some extra support. It was the first time in months, if not years, where I went over (not even in depth) what has happened to me and the emotions of it all came flooding back. 

In my daily life, I don‚Äôt think about it, I just get on with things. Work, DIY, gaming etc. I don‚Äôt, ever, think about it. Flashbacks, or triggers or whatever, when they do happen, I just squash with something to distract me. Nightmares, dreams, maybe I‚Äôll make a note off, but I don‚Äôt really reflect on them. 

I think I have just, got used to a life of dissociating, masking, and trying not to think about it‚Ä¶. So the emotions don‚Äôt come out. Seeking help from friends when I am upset is a no go because of how awful they have been in the past, dealing with it. People just don‚Äôt know what to do when someone is upset. So, I just, have adjusted my emotions and being to fit more ‚Äòacceptable‚Äô. Not to say I would be going and having a mental breakdown each time I see a friend. 

But yeah, I guess, Thursday was a bit of the shock to the system, because I actually gave time for my emotions to come out a bit. 

I guess, I wish I felt that seeking support from other people, was pointless. People really just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Sorry, not sure what this is. More of just a rant or something I guess. Just hope maybe someone understands. ",ptsd
"Dissociation?? Or normal behavior I was diagnosed woth PTSD close to 2 years ago ish and I'm still identifying what is connected to that. Lately, past two ish months, I've notice my ability to concentrate is virtually non-existent. I will start a conversation with someone and maybe 10 seconds in I feel as if I completely zone out but I'm not even sure if I'm thinking about other things or just not listening? I'll catch myself and try to get back to listening and almost immediately my brain does the same thing. I will also I guess go into my own mind and my hands or body will start moving, and eventhough I'm kind of aware I'm doing it I'm not aware of me doing it...I find it rrally hard to explain. It kinda of feels like tunnel vision where sometimes it doesn't even feel like I'm looking at anything and I'm in my own little bubble? Anyways, it looks weird to those around me and they'll say something to me about it and then I feel like a weirdo. Then in groups I feel super disconnected and not paying attention to the people around me but more so of whats going on but I'm still not really thinking? I'm not sure if this would even be connected to my PTSD diagnosis and worth bringing up next time i get seen or if it's normal and I'm just noticing it more often lately.

The only reason I've really noticed is because people keep bringing it up to me and I feel as if it's affecting my relationships, friendships, and job.

"How do I mom with PTSD? (TW-SI, SA) Looking for parental advice. I'm mom to a 12 year old and a 7 year old.  Love my boys and I wish I could give them the world. However, I continue to be triggered as certain milestones are met. I realize I'm projecting my illness onto them and they do not deserve that. I hate myself for how angry I can be and the things I will scream. I'm in therapy. Goodness, I feel like I am trying everything but there is no permanent fix to my over- reactions. 

My entire life I've had SI and I made my first attempt when I was 25. My second attempt was 4 years ago. My ingrained mindset is that my life will be short because I cannot be the mom my boys need me to be. So there's a subconscious bias towards not building the tightest bond with them. Which is not helpful! 

I know it would help for me to accept and be mindful about my mental illness. I love meditation and learning about Buddhism. I cannot get myself to incorporate the practices I learn in the real world. I lose my head so fast. I hate it. 

My abuse began when my abuser would have been around 12 years old. Puberty is terrifying me. I feel sheer panic at any sex conversations and I worry that around every corner is a pedo. I have irrational reactions to him being online. 

I realize I'm so far gone and I need to get it together. I am doing TMS at the moment, for the second time. I've had countless hospitalizations, done a variety of therapies, tried Spravato, stayed at a residential place for women who experienced trauma...... I guess hopefully I'm better than I was but I don't want to freak out and scream at my sons even one more time. I scare myself, I know I'm scaring them. 

Does it even make sense for me to hope I can be a better mother? They are obsessed with their dad so I often consider the idea of giving them to him completely and giving up on myself. Just so that I avoid doing any more harm to them. I weigh what might be worse - a parent dying by suicide or living with a screaming parent who is likely borderline abusive. 

Has anyone parented well with PTSD? Are my issues always going to be driving a wedge between my kids and I? What might be your thoughts?

"How do I re-associate? What can be done about dissociation? I genuinely feel that I am coming out of 25 years of depression. But it got worse first. I didn't sleep for 30 days and I went into a psychotic state that I stayed in for months. I'm not psychotic anymore. I may not even be depressed anymore. But PTSD, that I have. The psychotic state was very traumatic. I had PTSD already from being on life support and nearly dying. This was worse though. It was like being on a Holodeck with all my worst nightmares. I still have to tell myself on a daily basis, it didn't happen, look at how ridiculous and impossible it all was. But it's harder to get through to myself that that wasn't real when I'm dissociating and am depersonalized and often derealized, not completely but a little. I don't feel real sometimes. During all of that I lost my memory. Now it's back, but other than my mom and dad, I don't really have any connection with anybody. My brother and sisters hate me and I feel no affection for them at all. It's like, I remember that life but I don't feel like it was me that lived it. And because of the nature of some of my psychosis, I reject feeling like myself again. Me = bad. Don't feel like me.

"I think I just had my first full-body & mind flashback to a time which is still cloudy from amnesia (& I don't want the amnesia to go away, I don't want the memories anymore) I was having anxiety & a panic attack from emetophobia. But partway through it, something triggered - teachers, nit the teacher voice, don't want it, don't want it anymore, teachers aren't safe, don't want it. When I managed to be grounded enough to lie down (54321 method), it was as if something unlocked. I kept having rapid abstract thoughts & sensations which go back to two of my traumas (one when I was 13 - 15 but peaked at 15, & 1 when I was 8). It was very scary, and I couldn't stop crying, or feeling relief each time I said to myself I don't want it anymore, don't want it, don't want it, I don't like this anymore, I don't want this anymore. Towards the end, it felt less like a flashback and more like... purging? Detox? As of it was all finally leaving.

"my abuser bragged to strangers about what he did to me the other day, i was eating my lunch in the library of my school‚Äîsomething i do specifically because it is mostly empty and i know that he wont be there. my guard is always up anyway, and i frequently scan the library to make sure its still safe. this day in particular, i was very focused on a video, and was paying much less attention to my surroundings than usual. when i was about to leave the library and return to class, i looked up, and lo and behold, there he was sitting at a table in the library with a group of people. i panicked, and before i could even think, i bolted out the emergency exit that i purposely sit next to. it was a fairly dramatic ordeal. i went straight to the guidance office, and refused to leave my spot hiding on the floor in the corner of a counselors office for the rest of the day (several hours). this whole situation was incredibly distressing to me. im still grappling with the fact that he is going to my school in the first place, as he was put into online school for the years following what he did to me and my friends. but now hes back.  
anyway, two days later, i was sitting in my class when the person sitting next to me asked to talk to me about him. my blood ran cold. how did she know him? how did she know my involvement with him? despite my trepidation, i heard her out. turns out, she was sitting at the table in the library with him. she had been sitting with her friend, and he had come up to them with one of his friends. apparently, when they saw my grand escape, he pointed it out to the whole group and proceeded to TELL THEM ABOUT EVERYTJING THAT HE DID, WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE. he told then everything, he was fucking BRAGGING about it. my classmate told me that everyone at the table got super uncomfortable with the things he was saying (thank god). i am just in so much shock and disbelief. i have been so triggered since all of this happened, constantly trapped in my head. i just needed to get this out there, to people who understand. ive never posted to this subreddit before, so hello, all.  

this is all so surreal to me. i have spoken to the school about him countless times. they know all about him, they know all about our history. they have done next to nothing to help me. for fucks sake, he ended up a felon after everything that happened, which is particularly difficult to accomplish at our young age. i dont understand how he is still allowed to go to my school. everyone keeps telling me ""hes in therapy, hes taking meds, hes changed!"" but i know the truth. i can see the truth in the way he smirks at me as we pass each other in the hallways. i can see the truth in how he shit talks me on his instagram story. i can see the truth in how he is constantly joking about the ways he hurt me, as if he didnt ruin my fucking life. i am sick and tired of everyone excusing the things he has done. bold of me to assume that once we were in high school, they would actually take it seriously. had they taken my concerns seriously in middle school, i wouldnt be here posting to a ptsd subreddit for fucks sake. i feel so forsaken in so many ways, and so disillusioned.

"Breakups igniting trauma TW: SA, Self Harm

My ex bf and I had a 1.5year long live in relationship where we were very much in love, and even were planning to get married.

"Has anyone else backslid with their anxiety since getting diagnosed with PTSD? TW: suicide and self harm 
‚Äî‚Äî
‚Äî‚Äî
I was diagnosed with anxiety in middle school and started meds in high school (my mom was opposed for a long time). I also had depression. I was in therapy and got ahold of my anxiety. I had tapered down my dose of SSRI‚Äôs once I got to college and managed to really get my anxiety under control. I haven‚Äôt self harmed in 3 years. 

And then I underwent an experience that gave me PTSD, about a year and a half ago. Since then, all the work I did to finally get my anxiety and depression under control came crashing down.  I feel like I had taken years to make a ball of yarn out of a long thread, and within the span of months, someone attached a drill to the yarn and un-did all my hard work. 

I was suicidal and had thoughts of hurting myself for the first time in YEARS a few days ago. I‚Äôm slowly crawling out of a depressive episode that‚Äôs lasted a couple weeks - my last one was sometime in high school, and I‚Äôm currently a junior in college. 

I feel so frustrated with myself. I worked so hard to get to where I am mentally: lots of meds adjustments and therapy and me working my butt off to change my thinking. Not to mention tacking an ADHD diagnosis on top of my anxiety and depression when I was a senior in high school, which also required adding more meds, and I crushed it. I am so proud of myself for that. 

But PTSD is the latest diagnosis and I feel like it has ruined me and set me so far back. I had to up my dose of SSRI‚Äôs. I‚Äôm back in intensive therapy - once or twice a week just to stay on track. My anxiety has a chokehold on me, and is combining with my ADHD to give me to worst anxiety paralysis of my life.

He lies in a desolate bed, under warm blankets, his head utop a pillow. A sigh builds and erupts from his chest, entirely voluntary. Eyes shut, the difference unchanged, the darkness immeasurable. Beyond awoken, despite desperation for unconsciousness. Gnashing of teeth, clenching fists, shortness of breath. Waves of unbridled stress bound, seemingly unstoppable. 

Calm to despair, relaxation to agony, a never ending cycle. Perfectly still, tossing and turning, the sheets unraveling and twisting, the bed still perfectly made. Fettered windows, light peers through the curtain, a wretched veil. Haunting visages of times long since past, days or decades?

"Vivid ‚Äúflashbacks‚Äù of very specific harm I never experienced. Please help. For the past two weeks, I‚Äôve been having an intrusive thought in which my face is suddenly cut by a sharp object from the left corner of my mouth, through my nose and right eye, and ends at my right eyebrow. This happens in a split second, and it causes me to flinch and move my hand towards my face as to cover it. Every day it happens more frequently.

The thing is, I have never cut my face in such a manner. I did cut my index finger wide open about two years back, and I experienced similar flashbacks for a few days after the incident, but it hasn‚Äôt happened since.

Perhaps a bit of background would help:

I grew up in Mexico in a ‚Äúwar zone‚Äù between rival cartels, so I am no stranger to death and gore. I‚Äôd rather not get into details of things I saw growing up. Many of the friends I went to school fell victims to this violence, and less than half of the boys who were in my grade are still with us today. Never realized how messed up this situation was until I moved to the United States and saw that my childhood wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù This hasn‚Äôt really affected me as far as I can tell though. I‚Äôm very introverted but I‚Äôve always been that way. 

Is it possible that my childhood is catching up to me? Are the flashbacks from the old cut on my finger coming back? Or is my brain simply messing with me? 

Any assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.

"Feeling extremely isolated by gender  Obligatory my trauma does not invalidate or minimize your own experiences

I‚Äôm not sure where to start. I guess, it is just very hard living in a world in which not only is there so much of this made up divide between men and women, treated as a condition of nature rather than nurtured differences, but over and over culture reflects this portrayal of who harm doers and victims tend to be that absolutely contradicts my experience 

I feel doubly isolated, on one end for not being a woman as a victim, and yet even moreso by having had multiple traumatic experiences of abuse coming from multiple women. The men in my life have actually, still with flaws (mainly neglect/ a lack of communication), treated me quite well and been supports in my life, but I am at a point where I struggle to connect with women, despite (logically) knowing that we are all just people. I find myself much easier to let down my guard with men and nonbinary people, but for whatever reason when it comes to women I dissociate, I start seeing myself from an outside perspective as I so often had to with abusers who were *determined* to paint this stereotypical picture of them as some loving, kind person and me as some kind of instigator. I don‚Äôt want to, but I feel so much worlds apart that I miss out on being able to connect with people who otherwise I often feel I could have been great friends with. 

It especially can hurt even with women who are otherwise nice people, in that when it comes to things like abuse, I often find myself in a position where experiences like mine are minimized, where over and over I am expected to sympathize with a narrative that abuse is such a hard thing that *women* have to go through and fear from *men*. And I‚Äôm not stupid, I get that is the statistical majority and holds a different weight due to patriarchy influencing the dynamic, but I wish people realized that they don‚Äôt have to be so exclusive in discussions of gender, of abuse. And that gender doesn‚Äôt *only* play a role when it‚Äôs a man as a perpetrator and woman as a victim- each part of the puzzle just each comes with its own dynamic, and being a guy abused by a woman is still absolutely influenced in its own unique ways by gender dynamics. 

Idk, i have more to say but feel drained writing this, I want to speak from the heart about how this struggle has been sitting with me lately but I feel shut down by needing to filter as to not come off as some asshat MRA type. That need to filter so much in itself is ironically probably a big part of what I was getting at.

"My Advice on Dealing with Explosive Emotions Like Anger | As a Medical Case Management Student with PTSD I originally shared this advice on someone‚Äôs post, but thought it might help more people. I hope this reaches those dealing with outbursts related to overwhelm. Remember, these are just symptoms‚Äînot reflections of your character‚Äîand you can lessen their impact over time.

Start by learning about yourself and recognizing the signs of overwhelm as they build. If you feel yourself escalating, it‚Äôs crucial to intervene before reaching a state of overwhelm. I struggle with this too‚Äîthrowing myself at objects, hitting, kicking, or clawing at anything. This isn‚Äôt because you‚Äôre violent; it‚Äôs because you deserved a break sooner.

When you‚Äôre in a positive headspace, write down comforting activities you can turn to when needed. Some can focus on the trigger (like journaling about your feelings), others redirect your attention (like playing a video game or watching a comforting show), and some allow you to expel energy (like using bilateral tapping or somatic shaking). You might also designate a safe, calm space for recovery or use physical remedies like hot pads, baths, or showers for tension relief. Herbal remedies, such as ginger and chamomile tea, have calming and anti-inflammatory effects. For those who use THC to manage symptoms, this tea can help soothe respiratory and sinus inflammation (though not as a cure or prevention for smoking-related illness). I recommend adding oat milk!

Personally, I created an emergency/self-care bag with items I know I‚Äôd want someone to give me when I‚Äôm overwhelmed: journals, a book, fidget toys (especially ones you can squeeze), and multiple pre-written emergency plans. I even customized my own journal prompts with help from ChatGPT to ensure they‚Äôre ready to use without needing to think them up when I‚Äôm overwhelmed. These plans outline the steps I expect myself to follow when disoriented by stress. Over time, these coping skills become automatic as your brain recognizes the pattern and knows it‚Äôs time to take a break‚Äîjust like the last 20 times we practiced!

You deserve to feel better. Take steps to plan ahead and intervene sooner. You do deserve to feel okay. Your energy isn‚Äôt your fault; it‚Äôs your body‚Äôs way of trying to keep you safe. Let it know it‚Äôs safe in your hands by practicing self-care sooner. You got this! 

I look forward to your comments! Questions about the advice are welcome‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôll be finishing my bachelor‚Äôs in medical case management this year, so I understand how to live with, manage, and find resources for these challenges‚Äîfrom both an advocacy/resource allocation perspective and a patient perspective.",ptsd

He would get drunk a lot, I haven‚Äôt spoken to him in almost 10 years after my mother moved with my at stepdad to a different city. I then opened up to my therapist about the SA and they told my mom and she told all her family including my stepdad.

"I got into the nursing program but for the most part, I'm just really scared when I should be excited I wanted to be a nurse for a long time and I used to have the right personality for it, at least according to other people. When I told someone that I wanted to be a nurse, usually the response I would get is, ""You should totally be a nurse! Your patients would feel so special.""

I worked as a military medic (68W) for a few years and I never stopped caring about wanting to make a difference and being a source of comfort for people when they're feeling far from their best, but everything that happened between the first time I said I want to be a nurse and now made me lose that calming presence, I feel like. My body is always in hypervigilance mode to the point where people pick up on it and think they're making me uncomfortable. I'm always listening to every sound around me and watching every person around me, which makes it seem like I'm not paying attention. I've also been told that most of the time, I have an expressionless look on my face, which makes others think that I'm either bored, don't like them, don't want to be there, or all three.

And then triggers are a whole other can of worms. I don't think I can ever forgive myself if something sets me off and yet another person suffers as a result of my incompetence.

All of our relationship, I've tried my darndest to be understanding and supportive.
But flashbacks are easily triggered for him, and since a little over a year, when he is experiencing them, he's been telling me things like ""I am scared of you/that you will hurt me"" and worse stuff that I will not write here.

Even though I have never done anything at all.

I know that it's his trauma. I've tried talking about this in therapy. But I just don't know how to NOT be hurt by these, in my eyes, accusations hes throwing at me. I would never hurt him or do anything. I know it's not actually me he's scared of, but I cant look into his head. I'm just exhausted, and sad.

We had a talk today because it happened again and he shut me down and said I shouldnt make it about me. So I swallowed my feelings and just let him talk and explain what he means when he tells me these things.

"Moving on with Medical Trauma This is a bit strange but I would like advice. I have been told by a couple of previous therapists ( who were lovely, but I can no longer see due to moving states, which was very planned and a great growth moment) that I likely have medical trauma. I was, and am, a bit in denial about it because it seems strange? For a brief tldr, I was extremely over medicated for about 7 years in my teenage years and early 20s that caused some severe side effects, most notably very debilitating pain. I still have very strong reactions in doctors offices, often involving crying fits or simply avoiding them, and for the first two year after the rumination was constant, but I am since doing better.

A major issue I'm having, and this feels ridiculous to say, is I cannot get over an enormous sense of dread when I do more than dip my toes into the art world. I majored in art and was preparing for a career in it, but the association with the sickness was so strong that I can't really do it to this day? I don't want a career in it, but it was the core of who I was for so long and brought me so much joy, I would kind of like it back.

I am unsure of what else to do. First and foremost, I don't understand how I can be this haunted by some pills. Second, it makes treatment complicated. I am on an antidepressant still, but have been out of therapy a year. I am starting to wonder if trauma focused therapy may be good, but I'm perfectly functional outside of some bad days, and I don't know if EMDR would work since there is no specific events, just 7 years of little terrible shit for no reason.

My toxic girlfriend sexually abused me (20M) several times, once she did not stopped and raped my first time out of me, its been around two years and i never felt safety not in the slightest, i can feel her, see her, hear her like an ghost following me, its draining my sanity and i am starting to have some really scary thoughts that i shouldnt, in a daily basis. I can still feel her around my member and it feels like i am constantly fucking a pair of sharp blades, i can feel her fingers melting my skin untill it reaches my bones, i can feel her hands teasing my legs and shoulders and i can feel the heat of her body, its been like this for too long. Will i ever feel safety again? I am terrified of my body, i just want someone to hold me and protect me and to have those feelings away, i just want to live, but i can't like that.",ptsd
"I don‚Äôt know what to do Hello, 
I have PTSD along side many other things. I have been struggling with my mental since senior year of high school( 2 years) and it‚Äôs just getting worse and worse. Now I am depressed all the time, i feel numb but my body wants to cry. I feel emotionally unsafe in my home( i live with my family) because they have done so much stuff to me. Luckily i have a safe place where i go 2 days a week. My teachers and my mental health team(CCS) is really all the support i have. I have been so dissociated and numb lately that i can‚Äôt express my emotions. I have been trying to express my emotions to my teachers( out of the 5 of them I only really trust 2 of them) but I am so good at hiding it that it‚Äôs hard. 
I really want to tell my teacher that I am struggling in the moment but I can‚Äôt, I am to afraid of being a burden and wasting her time. Now me and this teacher have a very strong relationship, she has been there for me always. I think what I am most afraid of me starting to cry and not being able to talk, now i could text or email her but same issue I don‚Äôt feel safe enough to cry at home. I think i told her last week about my parent issues. But i think i was dissociated. The reason why i am bringing this up is because my IEP is coming up and my parents will be there, and i am scared. I don‚Äôt know what to do.  I can‚Äôt hold in my emotions for much longer. I am wondering if I should make myself upset and tell her or tell her and risk crying?
There are some other questions I have:
The first question I have, is there such a thing as PTSD episodes? I also dissociated 

This question goes a long with the first question, can you get traumatized by this episodes?

The third question I have, when dissociating can you hear or is the brain completely shut down?

Another question I have is can you have a panic attack while you dissociated? When I come out of a dissociative state i feel like i can‚Äôt breathe for a couple seconds. 

I just hate being a burden and I know my teacher is on my side and cares about me and wants me to communicate with her. But that‚Äôs the thing I feel bad because I care about her also. 
Sorry for the long post. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. ",ptsd
"I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúbetter‚Äù looks like for me  People tell me that I will feel better and that it will get easier. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt feel like this forever.‚Äù I am doing everything I can to try and heal. I'm pouring love into myself, being active, eating well, going to individual as well as group therapy, and so on. I'm just frustrated because I am doing everything right and I desperately want to get better. It has been a year since it happened, and I‚Äôm trying so hard. But it still occupies at least 60 / 70 % of my mental space. Not a day goes by where I don't think about it. People in my life will say that I can reach out to them about it whenever I need help, but I could reach out to someone 24/7. I think about it when I wake up, when I drive to work, before I go to bed, when I'm with friends, when I'm doing errands, etc. I miss the person I was before he assaulted me, things were so much easier. I'm so anxious about it that I bite the inside of my cheek without even realizing, but it hurts my mouth. I don't know what I did to deserve this suffering, and I don't know what gave him the right. I can't even touch my own body, and showering is triggering. At this point I don't know what ""better"" looks like for me, or if it's a possibility. I just wish the suffering would end.

"Gambling as a Coping Mechanism for PTSD Hello, I first want to say thank you for reading my post. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place but I wanted to write my experience and see if anyone has been down the same road as me. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD & Gambling Disorder after beginning addiction treatment for gambling. I began weekly sessions with a psychiatrist in July to begin to address my addiction with gambling. In relation to PTSD, my psychiatrist has told me I relied heavily on gambling as a coping mechanism for trauma stemming from child abuse. Notably my relationships were strained and dying as I would withdraw & shutdown when I needed to communicate. I‚Äôve been working on communicating my feelings and trusting people I care about to show me empathy again. 

I want to ask if anyone else has experienced the high of gambling in that it removed the feeling of being scared? For me it allowed me to feel big in a world I felt so small in. I was scared of being judged and I still am, but now I take a deep breath and ground. I am a good person. I am trying to learn because I deserve to be happy. I make this post because I want to see if anyone has experienced this relationship with gambling as a coping mechanism too. Thank you again for your time. ",ptsd

I feel so overwhelmed with life. But it's always worse when I wake up. It's hard to describe. It's like there is a thunder cloud over mij head raining doom and gloom upon me. I feel shivers. I need to hold on to my teddy bear real tight and keep my eyes closed in order to not panick. I need to lay completely still. The images, remarks, sounds, things that were said all replay in my mind and make me feel super sad to the point where I feel like I need to vomit because it's just too much.

"People who didn't see their trauma, what are your flashbacks like? Trigger warning - sexual assault

Two years ago, I was raped by a friend of mine and developed severe PTSD, which still has a big impact on my life. 

My assault happened while I was asleep, I woke up during it, but now I have a massive fear of sleeping. Most of my panic attacks and flashbacks happen while in bed, so I take medical cannabis to help me sleep and haven't fallen asleep unaided in two years.  

When I get flashbacks, if I am awake, they are usually more 'feelings' or physical sensations, rather than  visual. When I am in bed and trying to sleep, I get the physical sensations, but also I get more of the 'classic' kind of flashbacks that are very visual and feel very real. 

The only thing is that they aren't usually identical to what actually happened. For example, this week I was trying to sleep and had my eyes closed. All of a sudden, I felt someone's hands on me (the same way as irl), then I heard a whisper in my ear, then I got a flash of his face on top of me (while my eyes were still closed & he didn't get on top of me in the assault) before I looked at him and he spoke to me, then I opened my eyes and had a full on panic attack. Does that count as a flashback or is it more of an intrusive thought/memory thing?",ptsd

"I sometimes feel like I didn't go through enough to have PTSD, but I still feel the symptoms CW: Mentions of SA, CSA

This is something that I've never allowed myself to confess. I have been very hesitant about saying I have PTSD, even in therapy and with a psychiatrist I've seen, I have been hesitant to brig up the idea I might have it. I was bullied heavily in kindergarten until 8th grade, I'm a survivor of CSA, and a SA in high-school by a close friend. What was even more triggering was reporting that SA to my school, being forced to tell my parents in order to report it, and then speaking out to the school board about how the school mishandled my case, only to have my small town turn their backs on me and have the guy spread lies about me through the whole school and town. Some people called me brave, I still don't feel brave. I feel used and regretful, I can't meet anyone from my highschool or town without being sent into a panic and wondering if they believe the lies that were spread about me. 

About once every few months, I google PTSD and CPTSD, and search through the symptoms. So much of it applies to me, but I have a voice in the back of my head telling me that I didn't go through enough to have it, or that I'm just playing the victim. I tell myself that I'm using the idea as an excuse for why I haven't amounted to much in my life. 

But I'm just left wondering that what if why I'm like this, is because of my trauma and my inability to entertain the idea that I could be struggling more than I thought. The idea that what happened to me did affect me, even years later. ",ptsd
"I didn‚Äôt use to deal with Justice fantasies until after my trauma My trauma didn‚Äôt happen until I was mid to late 20s. It was verbal harassment and bullying at work over a long period where I was sitting right by my bully so I always came to work terrified to speak and wonder what he might do to harass me that day. Some people may have handled it better than me but it really broke my brain.

One thing I‚Äôve noticed is my Justice fantasies where I think up what I wish I‚Äôd said to him were CONSTANTLY running through my brain. And the weird thing is, I‚Äôve been triggered two times since then by other people who aren‚Äôt him where I spent years having fantasies of saying what I wished I‚Äôd said to them.


But before the trauma I had a much easier time of letting things go. I‚Äôd never been triggered before the trauma. People said things that hurt my feelings but I could always move forward. Now it‚Äôs like I get triggered and I‚Äôm stuck reliving that moment until a new moment triggers me.

"I feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells with a PTSD-diagnosed friend and don‚Äôt know what to do I have this one friend who I really enjoy spending time with. We have a close friend group of 4 of us in our friend group. While this friend (friend A) isn‚Äôt comfortable sharing their full background with us (which is totally fine), we try to avoid topics that we know are hurtful. 

In our friend group we like to crack a lot of jokes which can be sometimes rely on very sensitive topics. Although we avoid the areas that we know are sensitive, sometimes we see Friend A getting upset and then we stop. Friend A says that it‚Äôs okay for us to crack jokes causally and that he isn‚Äôt hurt, but we can clearly see we crossed a boundary. 

A week ago, we all had a conversation about it with friend A. I personally feel like I‚Äôm stepping on eggshells around Friend A because I don‚Äôt know what his boundaries are and feel like I‚Äôm just hurting him.

I know I can‚Äôt just ask for what triggers him, but I‚Äôm really tired of just seeing him visibly hurt and allowing us to hurt him like this. It just make out friendship so confusing.

"Dreams.. advise and venting  I grew up with an abusive narcissistic father. I was kicked out/left at 18. I left behind my sister (15) she took on his abuse but was able to leave shortly after.

"Severe health anxiety  Do any of you guys have PTSD episodes triggered by health anxiety?

It‚Äôs to the point where I convince myself I‚Äôm dying, and then I physically feel like I‚Äôm dying and it‚Äôs like my mind becomes out of control and I become a feral animal.

"I need advice really bad !  I‚Äôm M (22 years old). Two years ago, I ended a long relationship where I got cheated on, which really hurt. I moved into a different apartment (we lived together), started a job (I had been studying), and began working out again because I gained weight during the relationship. Over time, things improved‚ÄîI built a good physique, made money, and life was going fairly well.

Fast forward to April this year: I decided to apply for the Student Work and Travel program in the USA (I‚Äôm from Europe) for a summer job. I wanted a change of environment and to meet new people. Plus, I always wanted to visit the USA.

A month later, I arrived in the USA and met a girl, F (21). I really started liking her, and over time, I noticed she might like me too. Other people looked at us when we joked, and the girls gossiped about us. It took me 20 days to tell her how I felt because I was scared. She said she liked me too, and we agreed not to get attached since we were from different countries (though only 3-4 hours apart).

After some flirting, she finally kissed me. We had an amazing month and a half together. As time passed, I started wanting to continue our relationship after we went back, but I was scared to say it. One night, just before we left, she asked what we were doing afterward. I knew she wanted to continue, but I hesitated and said I needed time to think.

A few days later, I told her I wanted to keep talking, and she agreed. Then, a week before we left, we found out she was pregnant. We were in shock. After some time, I told her it was her decision to keep or terminate the pregnancy. She chose to terminate it, and I supported her but felt bad about it.

I started fearing she would leave me after that. I told her multiple times I was surprised she hadn‚Äôt dumped me. This made her angry, and she told me to stop repeating it. I couldn‚Äôt shake the fear of losing her, especially when she said she wanted space after the procedure.

Her birthday was 20 days ago, and I offered to visit her, but she needed time to detach from America due to feeling awful about what happened. She insisted it wasn‚Äôt about her feelings for me, but my anxiety worsened. I began checking her social media and became paranoid if she followed any guys. I knew it was unhealthy but couldn‚Äôt stop.

Arguments began almost daily over my overreactions. I noticed she was getting fed up, which only heightened my anxiety. Recently, she said she couldn‚Äôt continue like this, and I agreed, knowing I needed to work on myself. We parted on good terms.

Two days ago, she texted that she wanted to talk later. I panicked and asked if it was about another guy, which made her angry. She told me she couldn‚Äôt deal with my reactions anymore and called me selfish for focusing only on my feelings.

After reflecting, I realized she was right. I told her she gave me a reality check and wanted to talk. She said we weren‚Äôt on bad terms, but I felt like we were. I asked again what she wanted to tell me, but she hasn‚Äôt replied yet.

I feel awful for causing her stress. Friends from the USA have asked about her because she isn‚Äôt replying to anyone. I know I‚Äôve put her through too much emotional turmoil.

At this point, I don‚Äôt want to get back together because I need to fix my past trauma and anxiety first.

**If anyone has advice on how to manage my anxiety and fix my mindset, please help! Also, if there‚Äôs anything I can do to make her feel better, let me know.**

"What happened here? Tw: su1cide

Im rapidly approaching the one-year anniversary of my 35-year long bff's death by his own hand.  We lived some distance apart, so fb msgr was our primary means of contact.  We had talked approximately a week before his death on msgr, but then he fell off the grid, not reading or replying to followup messages i sent.

I tried to convince myself he was ok, even though he NEVER failed to respond the same or next day.  I knew in my gut something was off but kept trying to tell myself my anxiety was lying to me.  Then his son messaged me, advising he just found my bff hanging in his bedroom.  This was the single most traumatic, shocking, and crippling thing that ever happened to me, and it took me several weeks to get past the hardest grief, but it still hurts.  He passed Nov 8 last year.

So this month has been tough.. slightly more anxiety and a sense of foreboding, but I knew why and was fine.

This past Friday, another close friend I talk to daily (via text as he too lives rather far) and value a great deal told me he had a work event and would be quieter than normal that weekend.  I was grateful for him telling me.  He was able to message a couple times Saturday, but no responses on Sunday.  Or Monday.

  Monday night I started to get concerned, but not overly so.  I was chatting with another friend and noticed he didn't even OPEN something I sent him Sunday.  And I burst into tears, convinced he was gone, or in the hospital, unable to access his phone.  I tried all my grounding tools and nothing was helping.  I spent monday night in an utter panic, crying and unable to sleep.  Same Tuesday morning.  

I did hear from him Tuesday and he was fine, but... what the F happened here? Is this PTSD??? I'm not usually like this and would have assumed he was busy or tired from his trip... but I went off the deep end, going as far to open one of his social media pages to see if anyone posted he was gone.  

Im embarrassed now, and didn't see it coming. But the second I saw unopened messages, it was like all the pain and shock from last year was right back.

"Severe problems with communicating and socializing  So about a year ago I left a toxic relationship, I was stalked, and I was treated like shit by my immediate family afterwards because they didn't believe me

After all that happened, I started to socially withdraw and isolate, which was extremely out of character for me because I used to be the most cheery, extroverted person

Over the last year I became more and more anxious/depressed, which caused me to isolate more, which caused me to feel even worse, it was a vicious cycle and now I'm in a hole I can't get out of. I abandoned all my hobbies and stopped talking to basically everyone for so long that I can't even remember who I am anymore. Its almost impossible now for me to function normally or talk to anyone because I've forgotten all of my personality traits, opinions, stories...it's like I'm an empty husk with nothing left to offer the world 

I struggle HARD with talking to people, even if i just need to interact quickly when im buying something at a store. I can't even talk to my own family because I don't feel like I can relate to anyone anymore. I'm just quiet and timid all the time. And as I mentioned earlier I've stopped talking to all of my friends too - 
the main reason is because im ashamed of what ive become and i know i cant live up to the happy, extroverted person i used to be anymore. I'm so quiet and lonely now and it feels like ive disappeared

It's been affecting my job too, I've been calling in sick more and more because I can't handle being around people - I'm always scared I'll be too quiet and make it weird, or say the wrong thing and make it even more weird/awkward. There have been times I've been scared I'll lose my job, which is just another source of stress now

Has anyone else dealt with this? Does it ever go away? I'm so lost, I don't know how to help myself.I had more hope before but it only seems to be getting worse as time goes by :(

"Traumatic incident a couple days ago, struggling to cope My partner called 911 because they were having a mental health crisis. 

On multiple occasions, cops in my neighbourhood have shot or killed people who look like my partner during mental health checks, under very similar circumstances. My partner was unarmed and no threat to anybody.

Cops showed up with paramedics, but the cops forced their way into my home without consent or any conversation. Barricaded me in the bathroom and cornered my partner in our living room, hands on holsters. They were extremely hostile and aggressive and I fully believed I was about to watch a murder. They accused my partner of having a knife, which was completely false and there was no reason to think that. At no point did they ask any standard question for mental health first responders. I begged them over and over to leave so we could all stand outside and have a calm conversation with the paramedics. After a long standoff they finally agreed, then they barricaded us again in the hallway. I put my body in between my partner and the cops and just calmly asserted over and over that we could all speak outside. I knew one wrong move and I would be arrested and my partner would be brutalized or killed. I kept telling the cops that they were escalating needlessly and making us fearful but they wouldn‚Äôt listen until finally the paramedics intervened.

"Why am I so stressed at night? Hi. I'm Mark. It's 10:23 pm. I'm in my car trying to sleep. I'm 19 and escaped my parents several months ago. Horribly abusive people. Looking at their faces haunts me. Sets off a fight or flight response. I'm genuinely terrified of my parents. I finally blocked them on all socials along with half my family, who thinks what they did to me was the right thing to do.

I have 9 sisters and 1 brother. Most of my sisters believe I deserved to be tied up and beaten. I deserved to have my hands tied behind my back with duct tape and kicked around the garage floor while my father is laughing. I deserved to be tied to a bench press and beaten with a wooden spoon by my smiling father while my mom watches for a minute in the background, leaves, and lets my father finish. I deserved to have my father grab a knife and yell at me, telling me that it's time for me to die. I deserved to have my face painted like a clown by him, so he could force me to clean the house while all my siblings laughed at me. This barely scratches the surface of what my parents have, in their free, fully functioning, completely sane minds, and free, completely uncompromised will chosen to do to me. 

I don't know what I did. I wish I could say I was sorry. For what?? I don't know! If I hurt someone, I didn't mean to. What did I do to deserve it? I really don't know. I wish I deserved it. I know I have autism and ADHD, and that they are associated with emotional dysregulation, so I was prone to temper tantrums. But every kid has meltdowns! Why am I the one who gets brutally assaulted by his parents? The one who gets spanked bare-skinned by a metal spatula? The one who gets hit as hard as possible multiple times by a belt by his father, a former football player and soldier in the army? The one who has scissors placed around his finger while my father squeezes the scissors, threatening to cut off my finger? The one who has his room door taken off his hinges? The one who gets punched in the face and called a pussy because he's crying over geometry homework, and bleeds all over his homework?

It's all in the past now, but the damage is still there. I'm over it and I want to move on, but something is really off psychologically and physiologically. I know I have complex PTSD, but I've been experiencing something new lately.

This weird thing keeps happening at night. I'll suddenly start twitching or ticking and hyperventilating. I'll start screaming and crying. The craziest part? I'm not even thinking about my parents. I'm thinking about something completely chill and unrelated, yet I just feel so goddamn stressed during the most relaxing part of the day, when I'm safe in my car all snuggled up in blankets.

Why does this keep happening and only at night? During the day, I can talk about the past like it's nothing. At night, even the slightest mention of it makes me want to ball my eyes out and scream into the night sky.

I'm just so confused on how I could be thinking about super relaxing happy things, yet my body is just so stressed and high strung -- and this only happens at night. It's as if I have two minds, and my body reacts to the mind that I have no control of, the subconscious that is remembering the past. But I will have no idea what my body is remembering. I just feel super stressed, but I don't know what I'm so stressed about.

And now I feel less stressed after typing this all out on my phone, but I don't want to put my phone back down. I'm scared of my thoughts. I keep fidgeting and moving around. I just want to sit still and sleep. It's 11:13 pm and I'm still typing. I just want my thoughts to shut up for once in my goddamn life. 

Anyway, I just wanna know how it's possible that I feel so terrified at night when I'm just thinking about pleasant things, like projects I'm working on or the cool things I've done today. 

I spend a lot of nights when I'm like this fantasizing about having someone to cuddle with, someone to place their hand on my face and kiss me, telling me everything is gonna be ok. But that's not gonna happen for a long time, and I want to know how you guys cope with this sort of thing when you're completely alone and isolated from everything you've ever known.

Hi, first of all I don't know I have PTSD but something that I'm really sure if that I do have traumas, I think that one of the first ones was when my neighbors killed my cat when I was just a kid, but tonight I'm over thinking about a robbery that happened in 2016, long story short 4 or 5 guys emptied our house and since then I think I've been or feel like one of the soulless human that ever existed (I know that it's really exaggerated but that's how I feel) and well the political situation of the country is not helping at all (I live in Venezuela) so... Yeah that's it of course there's more but what I was trying to say is that I can't sleep and I have classes in a few hours and I'm here over thinking and if I'm not over thinking I just can't sleep, I would be happy if I had tons of drugs like benzos or opioids to stop feeling and being numb all the time but well it seems that I will have to thug it out for the rest of my life cuz I can't even pay a therapist :) if I spelled something wrong let me know because as you see is not my first language.

"I had an episode over mushrooms I(24f) just had my first real meltdown in front of my boyfriend. I was in an extremely abusive relationship that left me with debilitating ptsd. I have been doing a good job keeping it under control the past few years, in which I met my boyfriend (28m). We were making dinner tonight, and we realized we forgot the mushrooms at the checkout. He expressed slight disappointment because we swore we put it in the bags and the lack of mushrooms kind of messed up the recipe we were going for. I almost immediately was flung into an attack, terrified(unreasonably) that I would receive physical harm over the mistake, so I retreated to the bathroom. About three minutes passed and he realized I was gone, so he walked into the bathroom and found me curled up on the floor hyperventilating, completely unable to speak. He helped me calm down and was very gentle and understanding. However, I am feeling so much shame and guilt over the whole incident. He was well aware of my PTSD going into the relationship but I hadn‚Äôt had an episode in front of him before. This is my first real relationship since my abusive one and I don‚Äôt want to mess it up. Any tips dealing with this would be appreciated. ",ptsd

"Quest for Validation I am healing from the past two years of chronic physiological abuse from a former friend/neighbor.  Due to us being neighbors, the abuse was constant and me and my family were constantly living jn fear.  This person is a mentally unstable malignant and highly covert narcissist that over the years had drew us in thru brilliant manipulation.  When we finally received their final soul crushing blow I had no choice but to pack up my beautiful home, leave my historically low interest rate, rip my kids from their friends and schools, leave my job and move as far away as I could.

Currently I am in sort of a protective custody type life trying to pick up the pieces of my shattered life.  My entire family is in therapy and I suffer from terrible PTSD, nightmares, screaming in my sleep, major mood swings, times of intense rage, memory loss and time perception issues and a slew of physical issues caused by the extreme stress for so long.  I hadn‚Äôt slept a full 8 hr night in 13 months.  My career is hanging on by a thread.  My children get horrific hate messages from the kids at their old school because of the slander and defamatory lies that the neighbor has spread from us causing their narcissistic injury and leaving.

Ok‚Ä¶ sorry about all that, just had to lay context.

All my therapists tell me there is not way that I will ever receive closure from this person for all the trauma they have inflicted.  That I should not confront the narcissist and ‚Äúmove on‚Äù.  There is nothing I can think of that I feel would bring me more peace than to try to explain to this person what they have done.  I know it won‚Äôt change the past and the narcissist being the narcissist literally will not accept blame of any kind.

My therapist then told me to start writing on this platform to help me process and accept things so here I am‚Ä¶.

How can I go on without some tiny insignificant form of justice or validation be achieved.  I feel it will just boil inside me forever.

"Depressed and Pushing Therapist Away? TW: suicide, self harm, SA

A brief background: I (36f) have PTSD from a sexual assault many years ago, and the anniversary is coming up on Saturday. There‚Äôs a lot of other stuff going on for me, too, and, in the last six weeks, I‚Äôve gotten incredibly depressed, have mood swings and severe irritability, I started cutting myself which I haven‚Äôt done in 15 years, I‚Äôm behaving fairly erratically, I have zero impulse control, and the suicidal ideation has been frequent. It‚Äôs been a rough time, to say the least. 

I‚Äôve been working very closely with my therapist of six years throughout this depressive episode, and she‚Äôs amazing. But I‚Äôve suddenly started getting really angry with her, and lashing out, and just starting to feel really resentful and bitter and directing it at her, for no particular reason, which is definitely new. I‚Äôm clearly subconsciously trying to push her away but I couldn‚Äôt figure out why. 

And then it hit me.

The main reason I haven‚Äôt acted on my suicidal thoughts is because I have to imagine that a therapist losing a client to suicide has got to be incredibly, deeply traumatizing and I can‚Äôt do that to her. And I think on some level, I want to push her away so that I‚Äôll be able to do whatever I want without guilt. I really don‚Äôt think I have it in me to go through with anything, thankfully, but I think part of me still wants to purge anything and everything keeping me from going through with it, starting with my therapist. 

I don‚Äôt even know that I have a specific question here. I guess I just want to know if anyone else can relate to this, and what you did if you found yourself in a similar situation? Obviously I will talk to my therapist, but I still feel angry with her, and bitter and resentful toward her, even though I know it‚Äôs misplaced and she hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong. So what do I do with those feelings? Ignore them? Channel them somewhere else? Keep directing them at her but tell her why I think I‚Äôm doing it? I have no clue. But the emotions are intense and my subconscious really wants to direct it at her, and I feel really bad about that. And I really don‚Äôt want to actually push her away, because I definitely need her support right now. ",ptsd
"Terrifying stranger tried to break into home when I was a kid When I was around 9/10 years old a strange man tried to force his way into our (myself and my mom's) home. At the time she was a single mother so she was very vulnerable. I don't know what the man wanted. To hurt us? To commit rape? Just to steal?

""*My memory of this man is foggy. But I know he followed us home and had a mustache, reddish hair and was around 35-40 on age.*""

He pretended to be a police officer but couldn't produce a badge (and my mother wasn't a criminal). At this point my mother and I were pressing on the door to hold him back from opening it and screaming for help. I still remember screaming for help and being terrified.

Then, I guess, the man ran away in fear. (He left for some reason)

This incident caused me to be hypervigilent for years. I would pace around at night looking for any signs he was back again.. *I feel like this trauma is unique.* Even though most of my childhood trauma involved my mom abusing and neglecting me, this was a whole nother kettle of fish. It may be my single worst traumatic memory even though I have dozens of horrible ones.",ptsd
"Therapist says I'm improving, sure doesn't feel like it Maybe it's true in the grand scheme of things but man, the day to day is still such a fucking grind to get through.  Dealing with a recurring and unavoidable trigger and a rough therapy session today and I can't calm my body down at all, I've been mega jumpy and shaking like a leaf for hours.  Everything around me is freaking me out.  This fucking sucks so bad.  Does it ever really get better?  Do the triggers ever stop bothering you?  It feels like every time I work through one, another new one pops up in its place.  It's been almost 20 years since the initial event and 5 since the same event happened to me again and it feels hopeless.  I know it's not the best way to cope but even drinking isn't calming me down the way it usually can.  I'll start the day happy and okay and then by the end I'm borderline suicidal over something stupid.

"My counselor left the counseling company. I'm trying to decide if still need counseling. I've been with this counselor for about 2 1/2 years. When I started I was having panic attacks several times a week. Now, panic attacks are rare. I have days my anxiety is heightened but I do things I know that lowers my anxiety without taking a pill. Four weeks ago the counselor told me he was leaving. I have no idea where he's going or if he will still do counseling. He asked if I still wanted to have counseling and I said yes. We went through a series of questions to hopefully match me with a new counselor I like. 

Fast forward to today, it was our last session. I haven't heard from the company about a new counselor and he acknowledged that, and said they will contact me but he doesn't have any information beyond that. But he also softly suggested that I might not need counseling anymore. I have a good support system and know how to lower my anxiety. 

So now I'm contemplating whether I should still attend counseling or not. I'm afraid I won't like a new counselor. My life is mostly settled. I take Cymbalta but it's not just for anxiety, it also helps keep my neuropathy pain mostly in check. Yes, Cymbalta helps with nerve pain. My life was unlivable before Cymbalta because of pain. Now I can do daily tasks as long as I don't overdo activities that require a lot of walking and standing.  For context I live in NYC and don't own a car. So everywhere I go requires a significant amount of walking.

What advice do you all have?",ptsd

"PTSD and living in the same environment I've had cptsd and severe generalized anxiety from childhood

Due to severe disability and poverty I cannot get out of the environment which gave rise to my PTSD in the first place

Does anyone have any advice with this or know of any program that is free that will accept and care for disabled people to live there for free?

I've talked to doctors courts social workers for decades

They keep saying there are no programs for me most they would do is send a home health aide over to get groceries help with medication etc 

I would really love to find an affordable place to live like apartment for disabled people that is safe, such as doorman downstairs etc, but offers some  type of assisted living like meal prep or cafeteria or on call staff

"I feel like the most traumatizing thing to happen to me was pathetic. Context: When I was younger (7, I think), I got my period for the first time after being exposed to hormonal cream, but that's not the traumatizing part. They couldn't figure out what was wrong with me after a urine test, so they decided to do a blood test. Since I was little, I was terrified; what do you mean a random man is gonna stick a needle in my arm and steal my blood?! But one of my friends would reassure me that ""It's fine! I had some blood drawn when I was younger; it wasn't THAT bad!"" I believed her, of course. What else was I supposed to think? So, my mom drove me there and I was a little nervous, but not really. It'd just be like getting a shot, except instead of putting something in, they're taking something out. I got there, I got into my little hospital gown, whatever. I sat down on the bed-thingy and then the man came in. I don't remember the part up to it that well, other than them feeling my inner wrists and elbows (which I'll mention later) but I remember looking at my mom and closing my eyes tight since I didn't wanna see the blood. After he took the needle out, I was almost immediately smacked in the face with nausea and fatigue; I was a tiny little 7 year old girl, and getting even a little blood drawn drained me horribly. 

Now, why is this traumatic to me? Well, honestly? No clue. But the side effects of it are horrible. Not only did I immediately feel terrible, but only a few days later, my aunt, a nurse, checked out my veins, touched my inner wrists and elbows (I can't even touch them myself without letting out a sob) and said ""Ooh, you've got some nice veins!"" Little me was very uncomfortable and ran away into a corner to cry. But now, years later, I still can't even type this without tearing up; I'm crying right now actually. Can't talk about it; I'll cry. I saw a video where someone getting blood drawn was suddenly shown and I buried my face into a pillow and started crying. I read a book where someone got an IV and I had to put the book down because I was uncomfortable. Sometimes, I can feel the veins in my arms. It's very uncomfortable, if you were wondering; also a bit painful. Sometimes I even feel bad about how me being so terrified of getting my blood drawn means I can never donate it to people in need of it. Also, said friend who comforted me earlier said when I talked about it, ""Oh, I just got a lot more blood removed and I felt just fine. You'll probably feel better soon."" She said that to me about a week after I got it drawn. It's been years and I'm still caught up about getting only a little bit of blood drawn. I feel so pathetic; after all, some of you here have gone through horrors that no one should even have to think about, and yet here I am, crying over some old blood I got drawn. 

Also, they learned absolutely nothing from the blood test. It was completely useless.",ptsd

My region was just hit by Hurricane Helene. It's been a difficult road to navigate to say the least. Thankfully my house is ok overall. My mental health isn't ok though.

"I am diagnosed with PTSD, I'm 17. What do I do with my life? I'm sorry if the English is bad. I'm sorry if this is too long, this is my first time using Reddit to post. Thank you

When I was 16, I was raped by my then gf (now ex), and it's still affecting me now; to the point where my psychiatrist diagnosed me with PTSD now at 17. I didn't know it was SA back then because I assumed that it was just a normal occurrence to feel the kind of naked shame after the act. It felt like I committed a sin, maybe because I am Christian, but I feel dirty even until now. I've developed a severe rash from scratching myself because I have this itch from some dirt beneath my skin or idk how to explain im sorry. But essentially, she forced herself onto me because it was an ""expected thing"" from relationships, I didn't say no, but I didn't say yes either. I don't know, maybe it was my fault for not saying no.

The problem is that it is starting my academics and organization responsibilities. She's the school government president and I'm one of the school government officers; there have been times where I've skipped school to avoid seeing her, or just crying and breaking down during an online officers meeting because of her voice. My grades have been slipping too. 

I talked to my guidance counsellor about this, and it was going really well. Until they essentially forced me to talk to her (as in, I was crying and begging to not talk to her but they literally physically grabbed me and dragged me into the guidance room where she was crying). During the meeting, she was crying. She essentially said that ""if you said no, I would have respected that. If you resisted, I would have stopped. But you didn't."" And she was crying a lot, she doesn't want to be called a rapist because it apparently feels like she is evil. I had to stop crying so I could say what I wanted.

The teachers in the meeting decided not to suspend her, to protect her and me - and I was put on leave from doing any school org responsibilities. She is now paying for my new medication and covering for my sessions. But I still have this anger inside me. I feel like shit everyday and even just seeing her happy (i. dont. care. if she is faking it) or just her profile on social media - I have a panic attack and I cry for hours until I fall asleep. 

She just seems so happy, as if nothing happened. She is still the school government president, it was ME that had to adjust. She still has everything. I tried everything, but I'm starting to think that it was better off if I never opened up at all. I want her to die, to suffer, to have EVERYONE in the school know what she did.

My mother and psychiatrist told me to use this anger as a motivation for success. That the best way to get revenge is to be successful and move on. But it's so hard that I'm starting to consider ending my life, because by then I would know that people would actually take my death seriously and take her accountable for her actions. But I don't want to leave my family alone, what should I do? ",ptsd
"Massive panic attack during foreplay CW: Sex, rape, sexual abuse, humiliation, degradation, suicide, physical abuse, mental abuse

Last night, I was about to have sex with my girlfriend and everything went horribly wrong. 

In the past I have seen and gone through lots of rough periods in my life. I have witnessed events that someone my age should never have to go through. The most recent is from about 6 years ago and the earliest one is 15 years ago. I am now 27 and things are getting worse and worse. Let's get started:

12 years old: I saw my best friend jump in front of a train. The day before that he told me he wouldn't commit suicide and that he didn't want to leave me behind, but that day, after it happened, I came home to a message on my phone saying: ""I am sorry but it's my only way out, my dad just beat me up and raped my brother, I can't do this anymore.""

18 years old: my dad fell down 5 meters and broke a lot of bones and shattered his hip, my mom had a deadly intestine infection, my brother got arrested for street robbery and my parents got extremely physically abusive. 

I came out as trans to my parents, got bullied for it by my parents, berated, physically abused, threatened (death threats) and all my girl stuff got broken by my mom. As I found the stuff she was standing in my door opening, saying: ""if you want to be a girl, than you should learn to clean like a girl""

19 years old: I saw a motor driver lose control of his bike. I was the first one at the place, saw how injured he was, had to take care of him till the the ambulance came. Before he passed out, I asked for his parents phone number. Later on, police was questioning everyone, I told them I had their phone number and they nodded. 15 minutes later they told me to call his parents and tell them that he may not survive. His parents screamed, cried, had mental breakdowns and lost all hope. 

A couple of weeks later, a random guy jumped in front of a train at Amsterdam Sloterdijk. I saw him being ripped apart, just like my best friend back in the day. 

22 years old: I was dating a girl, she always insulted my sexual achievements, wouldn't cuddle and even once gave me a concussion, by repeatedly hitting my head. The day after, she asked me for sex. I refused and went on with my day. She drugged my food/drink with Viagra and raped me that night. I woke up to her riding me and threw her off me and slept somewhere else. The next day, I left the place and she chased me with a knife, yelling: ""if I can't have you, nobody will"" she dashed at me, I took her arm, broke it and ran away. 

Last night, everything came at me at once.

I was about to have sex with my girlfriend, we just had a lovely time of cuddling and I was hard as rock. She got ready to get on me and the moment that she did, I collapsed. My mind replaced her face with my ex's face and I could hear all the words she ever said to degrade me loud and clear in my head. 

I collapsed in my girlfriend's arms. She cuddled me and made sure I was safe. At that moment, I had the worst thing ever happen to me: all the trauma that I have in my life came back at once. I felt everything, I saw everything, I heard everything. All the emotions, all the insults, all the screams and at the end of it all, I was left in the worst state I have ever been in in my entire life. I never felt worse. 

Today, I am feeling like utter shit. I can't recover from this today and idk when I will. I can't have a psychiatrist yet, since I just moved to another country and am not a full citizen yet. I need help and idk what to do. 

Please tell me how I can deal with this. What helps and what doesn't. I am desperate and need all the help I can get. ",ptsd

"That's Enough Slices *mention of p*lice

Hi all. I am diagnosed PTSD and last week I had a ""that's enough slices"" moment. I am venting, and I use humor to cope, so prepare for that. 

My former job, starts with a W, ends with ""almart"", decided that a misscan on ONE transaction i made off the clock at another store was enough to get me arrested for theft. Yes, that is literally what I said. It was a normal day up to that point and I was doing my freight, till I was told to come back to office.

 Per policy it's supposed to happen in the office closest to the doors, which is the courtesy they give to people who are actually stealing, doing drugs in the bathrooms, etc. Oh no. I was perp walked through the entire store, having to tell the cop where to go because he had no idea, while in cuffs. I later learned from close friends that Coaches (supervisors) were mocking me after I left by pretending to walk with cuffs. I have nothing on my record, not even a speeding ticket, and they've RUINED this part of me.

Don't worry though, they told me I'm allowed the continue to shop there... No thank you. 

I was then held in jail for four hours while my poor co-workers, who have become my family over the last 7 months, and my husband panicked and called my parents and they all came and bailed me out. I had to change into jail clothes, mug shot, the whole thing. 

Anyway, I'm trying to stay out of depressive swings, but it's hard. The ""justice"" system takes forever and I'm waiting to talk to the DA.",ptsd

"What this spouse endures from his non vet wife who suffers from severe PTSD. 

What it is like to live with a spouse who has severe PTSD. First, I would like to state that I am writing this because neither myself or my wife are veterans. It seems like all the research I do almost always involves a veteran. Plus, it never really addresses what the non PTSD spouse goes through on a daily basis. You are going to need some background first.

First though, you need to know recent shit. My wife was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, on August 31, 2024, stage IV, which has metastasized to her brain, bones and liver. She had surgery on her brain first. That tumor had already grown to 1.61x1.81x1.22 **inches** in size, there were a couple of small ones in other regions of the brain. She then had three bouts of targeted radiation. Then she started receiving the immunotherapy drug Keytruda as well as what will end up being 10 doses of targeted radiation on the incredibly large mass in her lung, that has grown into her rib cage, has ossified her first and second rib and has also invaded her liver which has two smaller ones. She has 5 treatments down, weekend off, then the last 5. By the way, that bastard measures 3.98x2.4x1.46 **inches**!

A typical female liver averages 8.5‚Äù long, hers is 13.5‚Äù? Is the extra 5‚Äù good or bad? Can the doctors do a resection of the tumor and leave her enough to live? I read somewhere that the liver will regrow.

I understand why she should be extremely tired, cranky and just bitchy all around. Then factor in her PTSD and her lack of being able to show (just me) any love, sympathy, empathy, anything that shows even a marginal of care for me.

Okay, here comes a shit load of numbers,(for no real benefit). I like numbers because they don‚Äôt lie. Math is math. For the duration of my time on this planet, 62 years, 4 months, 3 weeks and 4 days, (22,794 days), I have been married for 36 years, 2 months, 1 week and 6 days, (13,223 days). Today, October 18, 2024 has without question been the worst day of my life. I know that what she is saying to me is not her. But she was extremely vicious and dug deep to just crush me.

I was completely devastated. My heart, soul and just being were shredded, I told her I was going to bed while trying to hold back my emotions. When I got to my room I just had to let it out for about 5 hours. I had so many tears just streaming down my face I thought I was going to dehydrate.

Never felt that, ever. I was heavily physically and mentally abused when I was young, and nothing my mother ever did to me made me feel as I felt last night. This woman was cruel, evil, soulless, an alcoholic and was born without a purpose in life

Now, for the rest of the story‚Ä¶

My wife was a Para Teachers Assistant, (we used to call it special ed). She loved her job and was damn good at it. She worked for one of the local high schools, and the vast majority of these kids are never going to function in society. So many of them had no verbal skills, arrived by a special van with a nurse and could not even sit up or even move. I think the parents looked at it like state sponsored day care and just wanted a break from it all. The schools looked at it like a lot more money for trying to ‚Äúteach‚Äù these kids. Which in my opinion was futile, it really was all about the money.

Due to HIPPA laws she was not allowed to know anything about the kids. What exactly was their deficiency, their trigger points and their history? In September of 2020 she got the living shit beat out of her by one of these students. He was 6 feet tall and weighed about 200 pounds. He blew up in the classroom, threw one pregnant teacher across the room into the lockers, took a full grown man to the ground and then came at my wife. She did as trained and tried to talk him down until his handler could get there. He grabbed her and took her to the floor and the whole time was trying to bite her face, neck, whatever he could grab onto.

His handler shows up and gets him off of her and out of the classroom with my wifes help. She tells my wife that she is going to take off running and he will chase her. At that point my wife was to let go of him. When she did this he did not take off running but immediately turned on my wife and went back to try to bite her. My wife's fight or flight instinct did not have the time necessary to reset from the earlier attack. She has a hard time remembering how things happened, but she knows that she ended up on the floor again, and just trying to keep his mouth away from her body. He managed to bite her arm plenty deep enough to draw blood and she thinks she got kicked in the ribs at least a time or two before help came and got this kid off of her. Needless to say she was pretty shaken up and asked if she could go home. They let her do this and instructed her on where to go for medical treatment.

She arrived at home about 10:30 - 11:00 in the morning just hysterical, saying over and over ‚ÄúI got bit‚Äù.¬† I took her to the facility that the school said she had to go to and they treated her wound and rapped her ribs. They commented on how deep the wound from the bite was.

My wife tried to return to work the next day but after about an hour she had to leave. She did find out that she was the 22nd teacher that this student had assaulted. I think that that is information that should have been shared with anyone that was going to have interaction with him.

It has been over 4 years since the attack. She sees a therapist weekly and is making progress, slowly. For the longest time she could not be anywhere but home when it got dark. She can go to maybe half a dozen stores, all of which have a low concentration of people. She no longer cooks. I think there have been two meals she made since the beating.

I had an episode where for 5 nights in a row I was doing really weird stuff. Like waking her up in the middle of the night with my coat and shoes on asking her if she is ready to go? She of course wasn‚Äôt going anywhere but I swear she told me to take her somewhere, this happened twice. One night I had a quasi dream that I had to beat two other people to the kitchen because I wanted the bread and butter. I woke up in the kitchen alone. Another time I woke up flailing my arms falling backwards. I managed to pull the curtains down and woke up on the floor with the curtain rod across my face and the curtains sprawled about. The last time I woke up in extreme pain and falling backwards. I landed on a couple of computer monitors and a kerosene heater, in my closet. I figured out that in my sleep I slammed my face into the chest of drawers that were in there, broke my nose and woke up falling.

I went out and bought one of those sliding bolt locks for the bedroom door. I told my wife that after I go to bed to lock the door to the bedroom so I can‚Äôt get out of it because who knows what I might do. She refused to let this happen.

The next day I asked her to take me to the ER because I knew I couldn‚Äôt drive and she said she couldn‚Äôt. 3 - 4 hours later I came to her again and begged her to take me to the ER. I said I understand that she can‚Äôt come into the hospital with me, that she would if she could, but with how severe her PTSD is she would not be able to handle it. She could just drop me off and I would call her when I was done. So that is what we did. I ended up getting admitted, my blood oxygen level was 64% and the doctors and nurses were quite concerned. I knew I had COPD and it had progressed to this point rapidly. I now have supplemental oxygen 24/7 and for the most part I am doing ok about 80% of the time. The other 20% I feel like I am going to die because I just can‚Äôt catch my breath.

That is pretty much the back story, the following is what I go through daily. Let‚Äôs start with what I am either not allowed to say or do, and what she has said to me about how she feels:

* Not allowed to lay on couch
* Not allowed to say that I am tired
* Not allowed to say I had a rough night sleeping
* Not allowed to ask how her therapist meeting went. This I understand, she says it would be like asking her how her gynecologist exam went.
* I am not allowed to make telephone calls while in the same room as her
* I am not allowed to listen to music in the car or on the patio with her
* I am not allowed in any part of the house except my bedroom at times. She has taken up camp in the living room, sleeping in an oversized recliner.
* I am not allowed to comment on the amount of coffee she drinks, (12 - 15 cups a day) she says it doesn‚Äôt affect her. But most nights she gets 2 maybe 3 hours of sleep.
* If I try to talk to her while she is listening to a trial on Youtube with her earbuds in, I get a real disgusted ‚Äúwhat‚Äù from her.
* Anything important she can‚Äôt talk about right now.
* I am accused so many times of being a stressor to her
* She has told me that she can‚Äôt feel empathy for me right now, or love.
* She rarely shows me a sign of gratitude but will quickly point out something I did that stressed her or something that I didn't do and should have.
* She doesn‚Äôt care that her choice of isolation has also dictated a life of isolation for me.
* I figured out that I spend 22 hours a day on average in my room, she doesn't care.
* Today it dawned on me that I don‚Äôt care if she gets pissed off at me, but every time she has to slip in a good helping heap of fuckin guilt.¬†

There are so many more things, I used to have to text her when I was coming into the living room. This gives you a pretty good outline at least. I made a list just to help me remember the when, why, where I was supposed to do this, that or the other thing?

On my birthday I finally got the nerve up to cut a big skin tag off my ball sack. It was about as big as the end of your pinky finger and was on a nerve and sent a jolt through me anytime it rubbed against my boxers and I had to be real careful getting it out and putting it away when I went to the bathroom. I made sure to rub everything down with alcohol, even the scissors I used. Took a deep breath and told myself I just need 3 seconds of immense courage and snipped it off. I had no idea how much it would bleed. Three hours later I am still bleeding like I have never bled before. She got pissy because we had planned on meeting up with about 8 other family members for dinner. I told her I needed to go to the emergency room and get a couple of stitches. She got mad because I did this when I knew we were supposed to go to dinner with family members. She said once again that she couldn‚Äôt go and had our oldest daughter take me. I ended up with 7 stitches and a special clotting material affixed to it. She said that she would call the other people, two phone calls, and tell them that I was having a lung issue and was going to the ER. She told everybody exactly what happened, even though she knows that I don‚Äôt share personal information like that.

Now here we are 4 days later and her father is in the same hospital because he is having a hard time catching his breath and one of his legs is giving him problems. She is planning on going there early in the morning to see him. Do you see the irony here? Had absolutely no compassion for me, for a situation that I think was a bit more serious and she couldn‚Äôt go to the hospital with me, I thought due to her PTSD, but somebody else and she‚Äôs gotta be there.

Of course there is no closeness between us. I will rub her back and neck, tell her she looks nice, smells good when she wears my favorite perfume, I go to all of her doctor appointments with her, except her therapist, I went once. Yet, I get nothing in return except negative remarks. I get no physical contact from her which I need so badly. Just to have that human touch.

I have no one I can talk to about anything. We have been together for 38 years, married for 36. I have zero friends and always put her before me. The highlight of any day is going to Wal-Mart and getting HER car washed.

I handle all the bills now and if I see something strange in the online ledger I‚Äôve learned that I am not supposed to ask her about it. She would get fixated with these online games and buy upgrade packages or some shit like that. She would spend $400 to as much as $600 a month on this, and that was money we just didn‚Äôt have with her no longer working. But, I can't talk to her about it. It‚Äôs always the same, I am stressing her out.



**I am the stresser.**

"Strange Trauma Symptom Has anyone experienced a warped perception of time during recovery or during traumatic events?

I am recovering from 2 years of major physiological abuse and had to uproot my life and move away to escape.  As we are adapting to a new life I am finding that I cannot perceive how long one event is from another.  The previous months or weeks seem like years ago and my memories are cloudy.  It is effecting my work as I cannot gauge a project deadline.

This is the strangest thing I have ever experienced.  

Note:  The above description is from my notes a few months ago.  Three months later I have regained full clarity.  I have read some things in ‚ÄúThe Body Keeps the Score‚Äù that mentioned something like this but I am having trouble finding much other information or validation.

"Cold shivering trauma Hi. I had a traumatic event in a hike 2 years ago. I was reaching a mountain summit a little bit after sunset, and I was running late, as I should had been there already. The day had seen harsh weather, but its ending would be absolutely terrible. I was greeted by a heavy cold frontal rain that overcame my rain covers and left me soaking wet and cold at night. I had no energy left to warm up my body by walking and had to still set up the tent, make food and sleep. Luckily I was in a group that helped me, and we managed to pull through. I used my emergency blanket to warm up as quickly as possible and tucked inside my sleeping bag. I had never felt so much cold in my life.

Shivering, I slept, and the night was luckily calm. The morning sun had never been so welcome, and it helped me dry everything and depart in not such a miserable state as I was during nighttime.

Anyway, I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to this day back then. I thought it was just a mishap, something that can happen to anyone.

But I started to notice that it changed my life without me even realizing. Now, I always carry an extra piece of clothing, and I usually don‚Äôt feel as hot as the people around me. That seemed okay, maybe I just learned to play a little on the safer side?

Yeah, but the problem is I absolutely can‚Äôt stand the cold anymore. Any cold at all. I get out of a shower to a cold bathroom in a hotel? - I get shivers, a metallic taste in my mouth and flashbacks to the night. It is paralyzing to a point where I have to drop everything and seek warmth immediately. I feel like if I don‚Äôt, I could pass out and die.

I can‚Äôt even go into a swimming pool anymore. Getting out of it is just so harsh to my body that I pass the experience altogether.

Anyone else has experienced something like this? I don‚Äôt know what I can do to make it stop. Sorry if it‚Äôs a small problem compared to other stories I read here. Cheers.",ptsd

"Medical trauma - trigger warning, heavy topics  
TRIGGER WARNINGS - mentions of heart failure, hospital monitors, etc. idk if that might be triggering for some people so thought I‚Äôd mention just in case. Please don‚Äôt read ahead if this is a sensitive topic for you. Sorry idk if this belongs in this subreddit. 

So not to get too personal, but I have a lot of immense medical trauma from having a family member with severe heart failure who flatlined for 4 seconds, who luckily got a new heart. I was a senior in college, and this happened my last semester. It was one of the hardest moments of my life. I had so many panic attacks, I even had a panic attack in class because we were covering heart failure which hit too close to home because of all the damn stress. I was so embarrassed. I lost so much weight too. Just a constant feeling of doom, not knowing whether today they may not make it, not knowing what tomorrow will bring. And I kept getting worse and worse news. Having no support from friends, having to tough it out to not burden them and look too negative. Because when I opened up a little bit they didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt realize how much trauma my body held from this. 

But I have another sick family member now, and I‚Äôm so scared. It triggers me seeing the flashing of the hospital monitors. When they beep, and there‚Äôs a warning of one of their vitals being too high or low. When you have to wait in suspense for some news, hoping that it isn‚Äôt bad. My heart rate shoots up super high. It‚Äôs just one thing after another. I‚Äôm going crazy. I just can‚Äôt handle this anymore. I‚Äôm an anxious mess. I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about this. ",ptsd
"Recalled a uniquely awful interaction with an ex. CW: idek, forced voyeurism? I have no idea how to process it I was dating a guy two years older than me. He lived with his parents, where he helped take care of his two younger siblings that are both disabled. This was a long time ago, and far be it from me to offer a diagnosis, but all I really remember is that they were both wheelchair bound with breathing tubes and required assistance for all tasks. Neither could communicate. I thought it was sweet he was helping his parents while going to college. Turns out nothing is sacred.

I showed up during breakfast time, he finished seating his siblings and began making eggs. I stood nearby, leaning against the cupboard behind me. Making conversation with me, he started flirting a bit and grabbing me sexually. I pushed back from him kissing me and made it known that I was profoundly uncomfortable going that far with PDA in front of his siblings as they were 13 and 10. He pushed back, and basically implied that his siblings were so disabled that they wouldnt know whats going on and they dont count as people watching??? I can't remember the exact conversation, but I know his face got dark and he grabbed me harder. I'm very little. He easily picked me up by my left leg and my throat, slamming me against cabinet I had just been leaning on moments ago. 

That's the flashbulb. Not being able to breathe, my ears ringing, head hurting, hip hurting, his forceful kiss, his awful breath, all while I made eye contact with his little brother over his shoulder.

"I wish my innocence wasn‚Äôt taken away so young. 17F. I raped multiple times at was 8. It‚Äôs inasane. I meet 8 year olds now and it makes me a bit upset realising how young 8 is. After I got raped at 8 I changed a lot. I went from that cute little kid to being an ‚Äúadult‚Äù. I no longer did kid things I no longer felt like a kid. I felt a lot older than people who were my age. But being older now whenever I meet someone who‚Äôs 8 I realise how young that really is. I sometimes forget. That 8 is just a baby. 

I wish I had longer to grow up. I imagine my life would be a lot different. A lot better. Right now I‚Äôm drunk and suicidal. Imagine if I didn‚Äôt get raped. Maybe I‚Äôd be happy. I feel so different from everyone my age. I barely even feel human. I‚Äôm so depressed. Like literally right now I want to kill myself. I‚Äôm crying because I had so much potential as a child. I was so sweet and innocent. I trusted everyone. I wish I didn‚Äôt trust my rapist. I wish that back then I wasn‚Äôt so sweet that I trusted my rapist. I don‚Äôt know why it still bothers me man. 

I sometimes wonder why rape is so traumatising. Like why has that ruined my mental state for almost 10 years. Why does me getting fucked as a child make me hate myself and be depressed for the REST OF MY LIFE. Why can‚Äôt I get over it. Why do I obsess over it. Why do I have nightmares. Why do I need alcohol to forget about it. It makes I no sense. I just want to have a normal life man. I don‚Äôt get why I‚Äôm like this.

Maybe my rapist thought I‚Äôd never understand or would be over it by now and my life would be sunshine‚Äôs and rainbows by now. I hate my life. I just want to be ok I. I miss that 8 year old.

"Fiance has the same glucose monitor as my abuser  Hello! 
I need help or support. I have been out of an abusive relationship with a diabetic for about 2 years.

"Nothing, in fact, happened, but I am so scared  I am not sure what I have is PTSD or anything else. I have posted here before (ended up deleting after people telling me I was overreacting and that my problem was ""phone addiction"") and shared the story with family members and friends but no one seems to take me seriously.

I was robbed last week with no violence. It all happened very very fast and thankfully no physical damage.

I really have no emotional attachment to my phone or any personal belongings, but my phone was UNLOCKED. This means the guy had access to all of my apps containing all of my date for about two hours, until I was able to make it home to remove the device from my Apple account. He had access to conversations I had with my husband, my therapist...

He went through my social media (I am not guessing, he really did). He went through my food delivery apps (where my address/work address was saved, but also the address of plenty of friends and family members) and ordered a bunch of shit in my account (obviously to a random address, not to his address). He saw my pictures (no nudes but it really hurts me that he had access to pictures of my family, of me, of my passport, of my id, etc). He knows who I am, he knows where I live. He knows the gym I go to. He knows where I work. He knows my thoughts, even, because I always enjoyed writing and leaving stuff in my Notes. He got to know my entire life in those few hours, and I am so scared of leaving the house.

Everyone says its nothing personal and he does not give a damn about me because he steals 50 phones daily. I know that (rationally). But as someone who was stalked before (I was a 15 yo  stalked by a random guy at school and this caused A LOT of emotional pain) I am very easily triggered and since this guy had access to my entire life, I got super scared.

Not sure this is PTSD, though, or ""simply"" anxiety and constantly being on alert state.

I am exhausted and I am having a very hard time concentrating at work. I am easily confused, get lost in time & space, get easily distracted, my house is a mess, I am late to everything. Its like I went to therapy for years to become a better version of myself and recover from creepy high school stalker and now I am scared of going back to the same place.

PS: I don't mean to offend anyone because I know some people go through stuff that are 100x worse than this, I am not trying to say I have been through the worse thing ever and I am not even trying to affirm that I have PTSD... I just want advice, really.",ptsd

"""Some things just need to be let go of."" Great advice. But the way she said it was really dismissive, and as if she was giving me in trouble for still being traumatised. This was her response to me (actually in quite a vulnerable state) telling her I can't use use Headspace or Calm apps she likes because the speakers use a tone of voice which triggers physical and emotional flashbacks to the foundational trauma which laid the groundwork and gave me the trauma responses which ultimately led to me seeking out more trauma. She likes the Headspace & Calm apps, and that's great - but my response to the tones of voices used in them is to viscerally want to do the exact opposite of what they're saying, extreme rage, severe emotional upset, fight or flight, usually both. I use the Intellect app, and I like it, but she's quite ""these apps are the ones I trust so they're the only ones I want you using"" about it all. I also use YouTube tutorials and therapy channels, which she disapproves of.


Idk. I just needed to rant about this, a little bit. I've recently managed to forgive my younger self for the behaviour which led to me experiencing trauma in my teens, I've forgiven my family members for their roles in it and their responses. I'm working on forgiving my current self. I've forgiven my childhood bullies. But I haven't forgiven the staff who caused me severe trauma from the ages of 3 to 11. Forgiving people who were also children at the time was something I done without really noticing it, until I realised my mother still hasn't forgiven them. However, forgiving full-grown adults who made the conscious choice to abuse me at that age... that is much, much harder, and I'm working on it, but I'm not there yet. I've partially forgiven the men who took advantage of my trauma in my teens, and its a work in progress, but I'm getting there, along with forgiving that version of myself for having that trauma response. However, my trauma response to the tone of voices used in the Headspace & Calm apps is directly rooted in the abuse I suffered from adults when I was 3 to 11, and my mother is aware of that. However, she doesn't see it as trauma - just something unpleasant i went through. I felt very dismissed and pushed to the side and ignored when she essentially said ""it was years ago, just get over it"" when I know it's my nervous system I need to heal along with my inner child, and that is very difficult to do when I have a level of amnesia surrounding my life prior to being 16. Add in memory loss from malnutrition via anorexia and severely bad mental health throughout my teens, and I have a lot of memory gaps throughout my life. I know my memory was eidetic when I was a child, though, and I have the feeling the severity of my current amnesia is linked to how deeply embedded the memories are / were. I think i would've liked her to acknowledge this, on some level. But she pretty much told me to get over it.",ptsd

"Heal from Abusive Relationship I‚Äôve never spoken about this openly before, but I can‚Äôt carry this weight in silence any longer. For the past four years, I was trapped in a relationship that broke me in ways I never imagined. I gave everything I had‚Äîmy heart, my soul, my time, my energy. I cared for someone through their worst moments, through their struggles, thinking that this is what love is supposed to be. But in return? I was met with nothing but mental and emotional torture.



Every single day felt like a battle, a battle I never asked for but had to endure. I was manipulated, gaslighted, made to believe I was the problem‚Äîconstantly told I wasn‚Äôt good enough, that I wasn‚Äôt worth anything. I fought to keep that person standing, while they silently tore me apart piece by piece. They drained me of everything I had, until there was nothing left inside of me but emptiness.



And then, when I was at my lowest, when I thought things couldn‚Äôt possibly get worse, they threw me away. Just like that. They cheated, and I was discarded as if I meant nothing‚Äîlike all the sacrifices, all the love, and all the care I gave meant absolutely nothing. It felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest and stomped on. They left me shattered.



Now I live with the aftermath. Every night is a new nightmare. I wake up in cold sweats, reliving every moment of abuse, every word that was used to break me, every look of disdain that told me I wasn‚Äôt worth loving. I can‚Äôt escape it. The memories of the pain haunt me even when I close my eyes. I feel trapped in a never-ending loop of trauma, and I can‚Äôt seem to break free.



People tell you time heals all wounds, but what do you do when the wounds keep getting torn open? When the person who destroyed you walks away without a scratch, while you‚Äôre left bleeding internally? I don‚Äôt know how to heal from this. I don‚Äôt know how to stop the nightmares, how to stop the panic attacks, how to stop the constant ache in my chest. 



I just want to feel normal again, to breathe without this heavy darkness sitting on my shoulders. But right now, it feels impossible. I feel like I‚Äôm drowning, and no one even knows how deep the water goes.



If anyone has been through something like this, please tell me... how do you survive this? How do you rebuild yourself when someone you loved tore you apart?

"Bear attack I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm making this post other than the need to vent. This happened months ago but I can‚Äôt shake the trauma it‚Äôs left me with. I‚Äôve worked in the forest for years and encountered many bears but each time we went our separate ways with no issues. I got too comfortable following the usual advice to stand your ground and scare black bears away, since this always worked I guess I lost my fear. But early July I had a completely different experience that has left me with some obsessive trauma. 

I started work in the woods on a rainy day at 7am. By 8am I was an hours walk into a northern Ontario forest when I saw him. I was completely alone working with trees in vulnerable positions on my knees and such when I turned around and saw a black bear about 30 feet from me staring me directly in the eyes. This initial feeling wasn‚Äôt the scariest part but it‚Äôs the part I can‚Äôt move on from. The feeling of enjoying work to realizing something had been stalking me as prey and I had no idea. My heart dropped and I was in disbelief for a moment because this was already different than my other encounters. I‚Äôve always seen the bear first and felt in control where as this thing already had the upper hand on me and totally snuck up on me. Despite initial shock I tried bluff charging it, yelling and waving my shovel. He slowed his pace but continued to stare me down and close distance.

As he emerged from the bushes now only about 15 feet from me I could tell it was a massive male black bear. The feeling of having complete control to feeling helpless and weaker than I‚Äôve ever felt dawned on me. This is another part that I have trouble getting over, I‚Äôve never felt so powerless in my life. Realizing that this bear saw me as food and clearly was not afraid of me I started backing up and tripping over logs. I slightly turned my back to see where I was going and that‚Äôs when the bear charged me full speed. I started sprinting and screaming for my life. This all happened so fast but basically it closed the gap between us until we were face to face. I turned on my radio and was begging for help from my coworkers and nearby truckers with no answer. I started swinging my shovel at the bear while he stood up and lunged at me with teeth and claws. I swung my shovel so fast just trying to keep space between us. I hit him once in the face with my spade as hard as possible and was shocked when the bear had zero reaction. Although he did slow back down to a walking pace at this point.

The next 60 seconds alternated between me running, the bear catching up and us showing off face to face and repeat. I accepted I was probably done for when eventually I heard a voice of a coworker answer my cry for help. This filled me with life and as soon as we joined together we managed to scare him away until we got back to the vehicles.

The memories are still so fresh and mostly what I can‚Äôt seem to move on from is the silence and cold black stare the bear had. He didn‚Äôt make a sound and was staring into my soul with those black eyes. I immediately knew I was prey and it was the predator with all the power. I think about this every day and don‚Äôt know how to accept this experience and move on.",ptsd

"Abnormal fear responses and my first complex episode I guess I‚Äôll start with the fear response thing?
So, I can become startled, but it‚Äôs just a natural response with little to no emotion behind it. Rarely, I actually feel afraid for a moment, and never longer than a moment.

I wanna go ahead and add this is not a ‚Äúooo look at me, I‚Äôm not scared of shit‚Äù because that‚Äôs not true and that‚Äôs not what this is. The only ways I experience any type of fear is in an existential crisis sort of way, more depression driven than fear; thoughts like, what if I can‚Äôt handle my depression in the future/inevitable events that will cause depression? Deaths, debt, loneliness, failure, regret. It‚Äôs all part of life‚Äôs formula. I started having issues processing fear at some point in my teens, becoming disturbed less and less frequently, and somewhere between then and now it‚Äôs just kind of gone away. Either I live in fear constantly and I can‚Äôt recognize the emotion I‚Äôm most familiar with, or something (else) is not right. 

I don‚Äôt respond to scary movies, I don‚Äôt usually react if someone tries to jump out and scare me. If I do give a fear driven reaction, someone shut a dumpster lid too loud and it sounded like a gunshot, someone slammed a door or one of the neighbors dogs sounded too much like someone screaming, one of the neighbors is emptying clip after clip into their bank, my outside dogs are barking viciously at 1am seemingly out of nowhere, a car on the street revved/sped past and sounded like it was coming up the driveway for a second.

My reactions? I might duck, or put my hands up, I might almost hit someone, maybe I‚Äôll just sit up and listen for a minute. Maybe I‚Äôll keep a weapon nearby, I used to sleep with a hammer between my bed and the wall, but I can‚Äôt do that anymore.

Why?

Some time last year I had my first complex episode where I was not where I really was and I was not seeing what was actually in front of me. I‚Äôve had night terrors forever, they‚Äôve changed and gotten worse as I‚Äôve accumulated more trauma over the years. SA‚Äôs, guns to my head, held at knife point, drive by‚Äôs, getting beaten on several different occasions, wrestling a gun from someone‚Äôs hand so they don‚Äôt end themself before I was even double digits, trap houses, being held hostage, my mom being murdered, my sister being SA‚Äôd. My fucking house burned down in March. The list goes on and on and on.

My night terrors like to do this fun little thing where they put someone I trust in the position of one of my abusers, I wake up paranoid, insomnia for days. Sometimes I have night terrors every night, multiple times a night for as long as 2 months straight. I go out of my mind. I wake up fighting, but I don‚Äôt even scream or cry anymore, I just open my eyes and relax because it‚Äôs like.. oh yeah, that‚Äôs not really happening right now. I haven‚Äôt woken up screaming since my teens. In these dreams no matter who‚Äôs in them or where they‚Äôre taking place, the emotion it always the same. I feel cornered, and I don‚Äôt want to fight, I don‚Äôt want that to be my only option but I‚Äôm compelled to, and I wake up that way. I‚Äôve broken fingers and toes from hitting the bed frame and wall. I‚Äôve thrown partners out of the bed without waking up until they wake me up like ‚Äúwtf did you do that for?‚Äù 

In my day to day, I deal with a lot of dissociative bouts, like the shopping mall closes at random times, I can be doing something important, I could be in the middle of a conversation I ENJOY. Then I‚Äôm locked in the shopping mall and finding out it‚Äôs not really empty. I come out of it and don‚Äôt even know what I was thinking about, I just have the lingering feeling that it wasn‚Äôt good. It‚Äôs inhibited my ability to maintain interpersonal relationships and be consistent at jobs. Up until my complex episode, that was as bad as it got. Now, I don‚Äôt trust myself to have anything easily weaponized within reach if someone else is in my home with me.

When it happened, my ex and I were about to make dinner in the old house (that burned down). I don‚Äôt even remember what we were making, just that we were standing beside each other and we were both dicing something up on the cutting boards. Out of fucking nowhere, with no recognizable trigger, I just saw a hand and a knife, HIS hand, coming towards my face at Mach Jesus. In that half second my brain processed it as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to get stabbed in the throat‚Äù and my entire body tensed up and I went to try to stab him first. Came out of it mid swing, both of us looking at each other, horrified. He had no idea wtf had just happened. I knew it was PTSD and as soon as it was over I knew it hadn‚Äôt been real but in the moment it was and I almost killed someone. I almost killed my boyfriend at the time because I thought he was trying to kill me. 

Nothing had happened leading up to it, it was for no reason. I just put the knife down and went and took a seat at the table and he asked me what had just happened, I told him, and said It would be better if he made dinner by himself because that had never happened before.

I got diagnosed before this episode happened, I was officially diagnosed at 19 (got substance abuse disorder as well) but I had been treated for short term ptsd as a teen because I couldn‚Äôt get anyone to take me seriously. They thought I was just dramatic because at 13 I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and agoraphobia with moderate panic and anxiety attacks. 

I just want my life back.

I want to be able to work and make money, I want to have friends, I want to trust people in my life and hold them close. I can‚Äôt even do these things when the medication I‚Äôm on is working, and it does work. I feel good, I can focus on hobbies, have conversations with people, even strangers, but as soon as it comes to doing anything literally required to survive in the modern world and in society, every symptom comes back. I fight it as long as I can, a couple months I can hide it, maybe, then I‚Äôve reached my limit and I crash and burn.

I‚Äôm in treatment, I‚Äôm fine. It‚Äôs just, like.. damn man. ",ptsd

"I feel something happened with me but I can't remember  Many of you have probably noticed how popular the Menendez brothers case has become lately and it got me hooked too but that's not the point. The thing is, over the past few weeks I've constantly been seeing discussions about sexual abuse or coming across this case or reading other comments where people discuss their experiences and this has led me to the feeling that it somehow seems very familiar to me? I had a sad and lonely childhood and was often subjected to emotional abuse and physical one sometimes too, however, I don't have any memories related to sexual abuse, but for some reason when I start thinking about it, it leaves me with a very uneasy feeling. Adding to that, I've felt all my life that something was wrong with me and it all paints such a strange picture that I can't stop thinking about
So this also led me to wonder whether something might have happened to me as a child but I just don't remember it? I've heard of such cases but I don't understand how often this happens. That's probably why I'm writing this, maybe someone has experienced something similar, I don't know

"Relapse - What now? I was diagnosed with ptsd from a domestic violence situation involving substance abuse & sexual violence.

It's been over five years now and I have done what feels like every therapy under the sun. Dissociation has been the hardest and worst symptom to try and get rid of. The only emotion I felt for years was anger.

In spring, the dissociation broke, and I felt overwhelmed with grief and anxiety. But I cared about the future for the first time in such a long, long time.

I gradually reestablished ties with some family members with the very strict boundary that the person who caused my ptsd is not to be near me.

Two weeks ago, this person just happened to drop by when he knew I was visiting a family member, and he entered the house. The family member who opened the door didn't try and stop him, despite knowing the situation. 

I lost my shit. I was hysterical-- I ran out the front door and had a breakdown. Some family members had no idea of the context-- so I just looked insane as I waited for an uber in my socks.

Everything I thought I had worked through has come rushing back. Dissociation. Nightmares. I've been alternating between crying and rage. And I feel simultaneously that I am a garbage person who deserves to be treated like garbage, and that everyone else in the world is fundimentally bad.

I feel so, so hopeless. I had made so much progress and it's all gone.

And the worst part is that I gave him the satisfaction of knowing he still has power over me. I'm still scared of him and I hate myself for it.

I can't live like this. Please, give me hope. ",ptsd

"Was this considered standing up for myself and what more should I do?¬†¬†Dealing with my PTSD
 # ¬†

# 

Long story short, I fell victim to bullying in high school (I was getting beaten up pretty badly, insulted regularly, called the n word, harassed on social media) all by this one bully in particular. He'd say sorry always then just repeat the behaviour. It came to a point where he stopped because we graduated and didn't see each other anymore.

He sent me an apology on Facebook a few years after high school though. Fast forward to today, I decide to message him and tell him Ive been praying for him and wishing him good things as he's a lovely person. and mentioned how he probably feels back for how he treated me back then and I acknowledged that the message might go unseen but just wanted to let him know.

He responds and says it looks like im doing well in life and said he felt bad about how he treated me and said he wishes me nothing but the best. I then start to dig a little deeper asking why he'd beat me up and call me the n word etc. He straight out denied those claims and says we both know that never happened. I sent him a screenshot of him calling me the n word and he said he doesn't remember saying that and apologizes.

We end up going back and forth until he randomly throws an accusation that Ive been spreading rumours about him over the last two years about him raping his ex girlfriend and how I can't deny it since he has my IP address pinned. I told him what he plans on doing with that info because intimidation and what he's claiming would be grounds to take legal action and said we can take this to court.

He responds and says ""for the hundredth time, im done with these conversations, bye for now"".

"Im getting crazy (or already am I There's a man who lives near of my house,
This man its father of my brothers friend
But he certainly doesnt know me
He still catcalling me
And my ptsd its because of stalking so my brain its overreacting about the situation

I saw this man again with a Hammer and he said hello even when I demonstrate it bothers me

He put his hands on his penis some years ago when he saw my mom 

Today I was walking to my job and I think that I started with flight and response because every car parked with someone inside to me it was there just waiting.

There's was a black car that passed though me very slowly and another one that turned on the windshield and drove on when I passed. It was just coincidence or they were there to kidnap me?

Altough one part of me says: you're not Jason Bourne to all these people follow you, the other one says ""but if this guys is dois this?""; ""and if is from human trafficking?"". And now Im afraid to return to my home",ptsd
"Do you hide/stash away food?  Do you have the tendency to hide food in different places only you know of for, seemingly, no reason? 

I've had this habit for years. Just hiding dry foods and drinks in places only I check, like drawers and dressers. I could freely keep all my food in the kitchen and I don't really have to worry about someone taking the food that I bought but it just doesn't feel *safe*

I stash anything that won't expire or break. Hardtack, trail mix, protein bars, instant soup that I eat dry, prepackaged croissants,loads of flavored water- just anything that will last when left in room temperature and doesn't have a noticeable smell. And if the packaging is too crinkly or over all loud I put everything in plastic containers, like empty containers after butter etc, because even if I know I'm the only person around, too much noise spikes my anxiety or just deters me from reaching for food completely. I even kept military rations packs for a while until I got paranoid that the ""cooking heat packs"" are too noticeable and ridiculous to use when I have a stove just a room away. 

I brushed the hoarding off as me being too lazy to move to get food, but keeping everything close also reminds me that I need to eat since I've got issues with recognizing when it's time to have a meal. 

Do many people hoard the emergency foods for no reason? I feel like I'm insane for doing that so it'd be nice to know if other people do this too. This whole living past trauma is stressful as hell",ptsd
"Sick all the time I‚Äôve been dealing with PTSD for two years after getting out of an abusive relationship where I experienced SA.
I‚Äôve been having so many health issues since then and am trying to figure out the cause and maybe how to help myself as doctors and medicine hasn‚Äôt been helpful and I‚Äôm in limbo as to what to do at this point.

A few months after I left this relationship and around the time I first reported this person to the police, I started getting physically ill.

I started feeling incredibly tired and achy as well as having lots of brain fog and occasional heart palpitations.
A lot of my symptoms have improved since then but I‚Äôm still also at least a little bit tired if not exhausted and more recently have been having brains fog, especially at work.
I get sick with flu like symptoms/infections every two to three weeks.
I also have developed chronic sinusitis and visual snow syndrome randomly (I never had any health issues before)

Especially lately I‚Äôm finding it harder and harder mentally to cope, it feels like my life has been taken away from me and I‚Äôm struggling to survive.

I just want to know if anyone else who had been diagnosed with PTSD had experienced similar issues after?

"Newborn and Losing it (Veteran) Throwaway sorry for the wall of text

What are some non VA alternatives for therapy? Anyone else with Ptsd and a newborn?

I've struggled with ptsd for years, but this year was particularly bad and I just started trying to go to the VA for it which has been a fucking nightmare. I wanted to try and get better before the kid came but my community care therapist (who i had to drive 1.5 hours to see because no one near me was taking new patients) literally made me feel more suicidal so I stopped seeing her. With the nightmare that is trying to find a new therapist in the first place, I called the VA who told me there's a 9 month waiting list with the hospital to get someone. Only on an antianxiety medication mainly cause of fear during the med rebalancing phase with antidepressants when another vet friend who almost committed suicide during it but I but the bullet and contacted my VA psychiatrist to start that process (funny how getting meds is way fucking easier than getting therapy).

I'm absolutely losing it with having a new kid. 6 week old and these feelings have been escalating. Objectively, I know my kid is absolutely normal and there is nothing wrong. But her crying triggers the fuck out of me. Tonight I snapped and lost it. I was wearing her in a harness as me and my wife take shifts at night, bottle was heating up, and she just kept crying. I had to just calmly somewhat lightly hit my fist against the wall to concentrate on something besides the crying while the bottle heated up. Wife came out rightfully worried and concerned and asked me to stop and I just lost it. I just hit the wall harder while still wearing my kid, I just snapped. I took the kid out of the harness, gave her to the wife and just had to bash my head against the wall to get back to a more stable place. I know it's not normal and not ok, but it's what I needed to do in the moment to snap out of it (just concentrating on one intense stimulus which I have decent control over). I screamed at my wife all the suicidal shit I've been holding in my head. I still do think my wife and kid would be better without me.

I immediately called the suicide hotline. I'm sorry to say it did not help and they just sent another referral in to the VA for Monday. I was able to get a hold of another vet friend to talk to. I use to work in hospitals, and I am absolutely adverse going to the Emergency Department for help (same with inpatient).

Parental leave is coming to an end as well but imagining going back to work with this seems like a nightmare (new job as well so I don't have FMLA protecting it).

"I just feel pathetic and stupid  
So I'm going to be honest about this but this event has been bothering me a lot.

When I was in Ukraine a new guy came and he wasn't a veteran so like all the security and risk mindset stuff you'd think about (not to bore you with acronyms) he just wasn't knowledgeable for.

Towards my time leaving around January 28-29th he wanted to see the zaporizhzhia nuclear damn. 

I'm pretty sure the Russians definitely saw us, we went like dead ass right to the barbed wire and was looking over the line. The new guy wanted to go even further and scope out other parts but I knew that shit was mined. 

Long story short we go to leave and as we're driving man I don't know how to describe but this house next to us just fucking explodes. 

I remember seeing two people outside and when I looked back it's just black smoke and burning embers. These people are fucking done.

I should have died that day. That was most likely meant for us and we were the target.

I should have said at first it was stupid, but I didn't think of it and I should have known better.

Fallowing that after the explosion I should have got out and helped and I didn't. 

I think of that happening everyday. I relived that event so may times. 

I can't even describe the shock of being nearly blown up like that. 

I feel so guilty I didn't stop and help but what the fuck am I gonna do after the fuck they fucking blew up. You're not putting a tourniquet on a fucking dude charcoaled up and moosh.

I wonder why them and not me, what if we didn't go, yeah that village got bombed a lot and they should have left or joined the military but the longer I've been back the more I feel like I'm partly or completely responsible for getting them killed. 

Sometimes I've drinken to forget and sometimes I've drinken to forget have fun but when I've gotten drunk and emotional that's all I can think about and I want to drink more.

Sometimes I'm just having fun and I don't want it to stop so I'm alone with my thoughts again.

I can't answer the thoughts in my head but this is definitely a piece of why I get drunk.

I remember doing work and the artillery would come closer. The explosion sound was never an issue it‚Äôs the shock wave and the feeling of just having no power against it. I can‚Äôt describe. Imagine a guess of wind traveling kilometers after an impact. Artillery and gun shots don‚Äôt bother me from the sound but the feeling of the ground and wind if just ungodly and nerving. 

I used to do a deliver to one village and it was a small village right before the front. I remember seeing this most beautiful girl with her child. Her husband apparently died in the war so she took care of her kid alone. A week after I left that village was bombed and her house is gone and she and her kid is probably dead. 
 
I went to zaporizhzhia some days and drove to the work area from there a bit. I remember seeing a child in crutches because he had been injured. 

Theirs not a day that‚Äôs goes by I don‚Äôt see something that remind me. Every Ukraine flag I see on a car brings me back and sometimes it‚Äôs good memories but sometimes it‚Äôs this stuff I think about.

I don‚Äôt know who would have read to this point.",ptsd
"Healing Begins with Love Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a song that‚Äôs really close to my heart,¬†**""Healing Begins with Love""**. As a veteran advocate and someone who's been through some difficult transitions, this song speaks deeply to the power of love in the healing process. Whether it's healing from trauma, emotional wounds, or the challenges of life, love is often the bridge that gets us to the other side.

This song came out of a documentary project I'm working on about veteran suicide prevention, and it holds so much meaning for me personally. It's not just about healing for veterans but for anyone going through tough times.

Give it a listen, and I hope it resonates with you as much as it has for me.

"I feel alienated and alone. So I was just having discussions with my university friends. There was a point he made that it would have been better if I had studied something during the 3-month vacation instead of just ""enjoying,"" which hurt me a lot because I was working on my trauma during those 3 months. It was the hardest thing for me to take a break from the constant cycle of study and feeling overwhelmed. This fear productivity allowed me to get into top 10 and I felt afraid that if I fix my trauma I will lose it. But I finally decided that this suffering was too much for me and that I didn't want to live like that, I worked on my trauma, almost finished The Body Keeps the Score, gained a lot of internal understanding, did lots of journaling, yoga, and other things. Trauma was coming out with full intensity; I couldn't sleep at night, my hands kept shaking, and every day I woke up with a sense of depression, feeling like I can't do the things I love, and that I couldn't move forward toward my dream. I felt jealous of people who worked for it. I was walking on a dark road not even sure if I would even heal or not. As my circumstances were I couldn't afford therapist. I knew this study gap will fk me up a little, but I also knew that it was important, even if no one understood me and thought it was me being lazy. A critical part of me also thought I was just doing this to avoid the hardships of life. I felt afraid of what I would do when I went back to university after this much time gap. But I had no other options. After many days, I started to see results, and now I am very healed‚Äînot fully, but very. In recent exams I performed very well without sacrificing my mental health.

"Regression  I moved back to my hometown where my two abusers live(d). One died this year, god bless, the other one I think lives in the same neighborhood. I had two different men groom and abuse me between the ages of 7-15. The guy who is probably alive was my neighbor and had done the most violent acts to me while his daughter and my sister were in the room during our sleepovers in the middle of the night. The dead dude was my golf coach in high school, and he was just insane gropey. My ptsd had always centered around sleep, insomnia, anxiety around sleeping, who‚Äôs in the house, who‚Äôs awake/is actually asleep, etc. insomnia quickly deteriorates my mental functioning too, I can‚Äôt function knowing what I get to look forward to at night. When I do end up sleeping, it‚Äôs never more than 6 hours, it‚Äôs always around 5am or so when I do crash out, and I usually am taking hydroxyzine and cannabis products. I wasn‚Äôt this bad until I came home a few weeks ago. I believe this has regressed my behaviors to those of my childhood/teen years. And this is a living hell. I know why I was the way I was now, I empathize with why I was such a bitch as a teen. I have so much fear in this house and town. I never feel safe. I‚Äôm so scared I don‚Äôt even know what to do.

"i need some help knowing how to feel about my trauma while I was enlisted :( OKAY SO.... 
throw away for obvious reasons.... 
but this is going to go over... SA :( and stuff, so heads up ig?

here we go anyways.

this is going to be a long one so I do apologize.
I 21(f) need some help understanding how I should feel about this-
to start, 
I should explain my confusion.

I am severely autistic

(while undiagnosed because i like haveing rights as an independent adult human being) 
- ""high functioning"" and its not even funny. 
but nothing on paper.
no less the tism runs through my veins 
and I mention it because-

I have trouble with... 
understanding how I should feel about things-  
especially emotionally charged things like events or trauma.
even more especially given I was raised to be forgiving and to always turn my cheek the other way, and have lived that way since I moved out at 17

which is the problem.
because I am also a veteran, (remember undiagnosed)
nothing hard-core, mostly signal stuff and low physical work force. 
I mention this because this whole thing was while I was enlisted. 

I have only been out for about 9 to 10 ish months due to being medboarded for injuries.
but what happened has been...
bothering me to say the least but I can't make heads or tails why or if it should be. and I'm worried that I am simply dwelling and overreacting?

enough padding I'll just get into the story-

about last year (2023) I was stationed in state, I had recently left Korea and had been riding the coattails of my 21st birthday near the beginning of that previous December.

which if you know what a combination of those 2 things means. 
I was very new to alcohol.

when I got to my new station there were a few bumps that let to my units shaping a few people around, like raid parties threatening to have a gate named after you.

so after that and about a half of the year, 
i was getting to my new unit which is where I met the person in this story.

lets call him ""guy"" M(22)
me and guy‚Ñ¢Ô∏è got along pretty well, especially given the fact he was more simular to me then most anyone else there.
me and guy were both on profiles, me for lower bilateral leg injuries and him for I belive back issues,
so even though our mos(jobs) were pretty different, neither of us could move our heavy equipment-
meaning we both often ended up doing the jobs that thay gave to us and the other profiles.

basically, we hung out alot during work, and then after we would hang out with others guys who were also on profiles because there was that shared kinship with us at his place,
 
I fit in because I grew up with a bunch of guys and pretty much grew up as one myself- so I liked all the games they played and was more then competitive enough to keep up with them.

so this pretty much becomes our schedule for the next few months.
me and Guy hanging out, ""shooting the shit"" as they say, going over to his or the other guy's place for games n what not-
but over all I didn't drink alot during those times.

eventually we agreed that everyone just going to Guy's place would work best because it was closer to our company, and then the hangouts stayed there.

then the issues happened.

during that time I started drinking more to help me fit in with the group- even when they started to leave, I kept it up because social interaction feels alot less terrible if I play along.

nothing too crazy but with a bunch of rowdy drunk guys playing video games over the weekend, you tend to over look a few things, 
which that being even while still buzzed, I did catch that any physical contact that would normally happen, you know like pile ups, bumping your shoulder into the other guy, joking hugging as a bit or to weird the other guy out, etc, 
and a bunch of men chanting ""Go white girl, go"" ""Go white girl, go"" as I shot gun 3 beers 
and what not 

but guy‚Ñ¢Ô∏è's hands kinda reached a lil lower then the others, which... in hindsight is a big red flag, but I pretty take the blame there because even though we were gaming and drinking, unlike the others who were basically in shorts and t-shirts, I still wore stuff that made me feel decent and pretty- you know like how girls are supposed to (?) (again- still painfully tistic)

so, I pretty much called it up to either mistakes, missing some social que or just my fault because what should I expect ig.

but it kept going, and as the other guys started to dwindle, mostly due to their own medboards getting them out Scott free. 
Guy would encourage me to drink more- ""to keep up the energy n what not.""
which again, a big red flag in hindsight, but I am pretty much blind when it comes to foresight.
around that time my doc even suggested I also medboard given my condition was not getting better.

and eventually it was just me and guy‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, getting drunk and playing video games, which with him pretty much being my only friend left, I didn't have much else to do on the weekends anyways.

but he started encouraging me to drink more and more, meaning I got alot more wasted. and he while drinking with me would drink alot less (ANOTHER RED FLAG but one I think I may have intentionally overlooked because I thought it was normal)

and then it started.
I woke up back at my own place, after being black out drunk, with a terrible migrane, and a really sore mouth..... 
apparently while I was drunk... yeah.
which, I pretty much thought in the back of my head for a while but like all my other fears or confusions I have with people, things that happened, and over all unpleasantness.
I pushed it to the back of my mind, especially because it was Monday and I didn't have time to think about anything like that.

I should mention here now if not had earlier, but dispite the red flags, Guy was still pretty much my only friend left, and had been nothing but kind and supportive- often helping me with things I didn't quite get- helping me with certain social cues, and over all nothing questionable or overtly uncomfortable during the work week or anything like that.
we even were rather personally close because we had talked about our previous traumas- like his families issues and my previous trauma of getting groomed.

but then the next weekend the worst happened and the thing that is pretty much why this whole wall of text is here in the first place.
and again 

///this is not fun stuff so like, turn back now or somthin if you don't wanna read this stuff\\\\

but yeah.
with the previous weekend a blure and way too busy and stressful given we had to do alot of practicing for an upcoming mission.
so with the implied questionable blackout far beck in my head repressed and forgotten, I missed another red flag.

this hangout felt off, even in comparison from the previous ones, but I am used to pushing off that anxiety because I have always felt anxious when it comes to socializing.
and things went as normally as the hang outs go, except we had alot more liquor then usual,
Guy even chanting the nostalgic ""go white girl go"" (hah....) encouraging me to chug stuff.

even as alarm bells started ringing in my head, I was way too inebriated to do anything...
and next thing I new I was pushed onto his bed.
and he had pulled out a rubber.
I'm sure we can all figure out what happened next.

I remember every. bit of it. my mind almost imidiatly sobered up but I couldn't do anything to move my body. I felt weak, my limbs were impossibly heavy, I was face down onto a mattress, crying but it was muffled and I pretty much had to be stuck there, unable to do anything.
it went on untill he was done and had left the room to go wash up.
and I pretty much went fetal.

when ever he came back, he saw the state I was in and then probably realized how bad this looked.
so he pretty much sat me up, got me repressed and started apologizing, begging and saying that was an accident and he didn't realize  what he had done and that we are both clearly drunk.

it was terrifyingly genuine.
and heres my problem....
i can't tell.
this event (and the next one.) (yeah there's more because im an idiot) 
has basically been in my head ever since.
I think even I could tell it has traumatized me- to the point where any time I even think of remembering him or things we used to do I feel ill and my stomach feels like it's tied in knots...
but I can't help but think it's my fault too... 
there were so many red flags, so many things that any normal person should have seen and whiped out the whistle and ran the other way, but I just didn't notice I felt like it was just normal guy things and then boom.

anyways

he ""helped"" me get dressed-
from there everything was a blur.
the next day my primary health provider told me I would be getting medically discharged bythe middle of the folowing month, and I was told to start the medboard discharge prossess.

I was essentially a walking zombie, going from point a to b.
I started drinking more on my own just to get through the night and not be alone with my thoughts 
(I know, the last thing you should do)

my brain tried to blur out what happened, and even when I though about going to my chain of command I remembered just how painful the discharge prossess can get with any delay.
I just wanted to leave.

and with everyone else ready for a mission, it was me going to do the stuff with who ever they had available to help.
that being those on profile.
meaning I was stuck with guy following me everywhere for the next month.

I was blank, I was so focused on just leaving that I didn't even had time to think about what happened, I try to push it to the back of my mind, but it was always there, and guy pretty much either trying to save face or out of genuine compassion had been acting like his typical self, being as helpful as he used to be, making jokes like how we used to and helping me find my way around base when I got lost trying to find where to go next.

and as everything came and went, it was the next month.
I guess I fully repressed it because things felt normal again, even made friends with the new guys who joined the profile group, and as we got closer to my deadline I felt comfortable hanging out either people.

guy being there was inevitable because i hadent told a soul and was way too stressed and busy to confront what happened, 
so ofcourse all of the fellow ""cripple crew"" as one of our new guys dubbed us, drinking was unavoidable cus army plus my drinking becoming a problem, but I made sure that I wouldn't be alone with guy, (who had now become a borderline alcoholic too ig)

well. that didn't work too well because only a week away 
we had a fairwell party for me, 
and ofcourse, it was at guys place because it was close to our company.
-
I let my drinking catch up with me, I wasn't black out, but, I didn't notice that everyone else had left.
and as I was getting my stuff from the bathroom to leave I was pretty much stopped on my way out by guy.

and I pretty much froze.
and everything floded back.
I wasn't ready for this, I knew I had to be careful but I slipped up and now I was pretty much in danger.

pretty much the next thing I know I was hand tied to a bed with a ethernet cable as he pretty much started... groping-
now. 
am I an idiot- very much so, 
but i wasnt mentally ready to avoid him everywhere like i should have...
I was so used to seeing him everywhere every day that untill I was in danger I didn't even mentally register that these were the same man...

so another thing thats my fault ig..., but I did do somthing this time- before anything could else happen i pretty much kept kicking him off of me and even tho my throat froze up and I couldn't speak (because panic attacks suck) I kept pushing him off and was crying, but It didn't fully stop him cus he got the upper hand on me and started... removing clothing.

after... alot of indignity but no penetraition, it's almost like he came to what was happening.
he muttered somthing and drunkenly put what he taken off of me back om.
as soon as he untied me, I made a straight run for the bathroom.


I locked the door behind me and pretty much broke down...
after throwing up in the toilet twice I sat down, back against the door for what felt like forever...
I was just one week away from here, to freedom.
so I just, sat there... and waited and waited.

after a while I grabbed my things i had dropped, and left the bathroom, he was just, sitting on his bed, staring at the wall.

so I pretty much as quietly as I could made a break for the door, he didn't follow or even look at me.

for the next week i was a shell.
my brain has been a wreck since, but that week was hell.
my mind just played everything on repeat, I blamed myself for kitting it happen again, and I noticed all the red flags from before, I wanted to leave the army and never look back, all my paper work was done, but the stress was even more pressing because I had to move all my stuff in the next 4 days, hell on the next day they already had another guy being moved into my place, so I had to move all my stuff out, either a random e4 living there with me for 3 of those days as I tried to find a place to leave my stuff.

and what would you know, my chain of comman had the brilliant idea of having Guy temporarily hold my stuff till I was finalized ""because you guys are best friends and what not, dw your battle buddy has enough room"".....

so yeah.

we pretty much loaded my stuff into my car but I made sure I had another person with me, under the premise of my injuries and my stuff being far too heavy and I got the hell out of there.




so.

10ish months later and this is pretty much where we are today.
I know I should have informed my chain of command, and  it's likely going to haunt me for the rest of my life that I didn't do somthing, especially because he's already gotten out due to medboard aswell so I can't do anything about it now.

but there lies my problem.
I am haunted by these events in episodes, I can go at most a few days with it pushed out of my mind- especially with how busy I am in civilian life, but then I remember and feel all of this stuff again.

I. don't know how to feel.
what happened has left me scared but there were so many things I could have done to avoid it, I could have gotten retribution, I could have done this or that, a million things.

but I didn't. and somehow I can sometimes go a day or two or three and be normal- not moody or have panic attacks, even my drinking has become far more normalized and I bearly do it, maybe a drink or two monthly.
I feel I deserve this pain, or that because it was so avoidable that maybe subconsciously I wanted this?
or the fact I can go days normally that maybe in just over reacting...??
do I forgive him for all the kindness he's done for me and just hate what he did???

I don't know how I should feel.
that's always been my problem, growing up I had to be told how things make people feel, and that's what I've based my understanding on.
but i don't know what to do here....

please. any help or advice. anything.
thankyou for putting up with this massive wall of text and I sincerely apologize for any discomfort I've brought.

so.

I was in the army and got assaulted twice by my bestfriend, I'm free now but am far too autistic to understand how to feel about this and I am begging for help.",ptsd
"I need help I have severe PTSD from childhood, and 14 years later, I haven't made much progress, and anytime I do, I eventually fall further than before... I hate myself for being this way... why won't I just heal? I want to be able to be a normal person. Join society, and function... but I haven't left the house in YEARS... My home town is where my trauma happened... any time I leave I have flashbacks... I can barely take care of myself, let alone my emotional support animal... I never walk her, and sometimes it's hard to even feed her... my trauma involves having been brainwashed into loathing myself completely, which is hard to break when you do nothing, because it must be true. Everyone looks at me, expecting me to spring back. They look at me like I'm wasting my potential, and it's true. I just feel frozen in time, like I'm still that little kid, being touched when I didn't want to be, being beaten up daily, being whipped, and cut, and I just can't handle it anymore. I'm so overwhelmed by the amount of pain I feel, by the voices screaming in pain in my head, and by the distance between where I am, and where I want to be... not to mention my LGBT+ identity and the strain that has put on my relationships over the past years, especially as a Christian...

"Can you develop PTSD months after an event? So essentially the situation is the following.
A few months ago I was visiting two of my partners at the time and long story short is that I got really really high to the point of not being able to stand properly, much less walk, and wasn't able to really consent properly.
I stayed high the entire trip, and the only times they stopped me from getting more high was when I'd have reached a point where I'd be unable to speak or understand a word they were saying.
After the trip I didn't put much thought into any of it, and about 2 weeks afterwards they broke up with me.

About a week ago I started thinking about the trip again, and I felt awful about it.
I tried to tell one of my closest friends about it but that's when I realized that I was too high to actually remember the details of what happened.
I couldn't even remember which one of them took my first kiss or my first time.
Ever since I realized these things it made me think about the trip in a whole different light, and I've been having trouble sleeping, waking up multiple times every night, and having periodic anxiety attacks throughout the day.

Up until I really put thought into it, I didn't really think about the trip in any negative way.
I only started feeling awful about it and experiencing the anxiety attacks and trouble sleeping after I realized how impaired I was at the time and how much information was just completely missing from my memories.

So my question is, is it normal or common for people who experience trauma of any kind, to only start exhibiting symptoms of PTSD after they realize that what they went through was a traumatic experience?
Or rather is it normal for someone to experience something traumatic but not have any trauma responses until after they come to the realization that it was traumatic?",ptsd

"Progress is Terrifying TW: Mentions abuse and sex

Hey, all. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has felt this way. I (27f) have ptsd from an abusive relationship I was in seven years ago. It was my first and only relationship and it lasted three years.  He was very controlling, emotionally and psychologically abusive, and coerced me to have sex with him almost daily. I‚Äôve been in therapy for four years to try and work through this.  I have only been on a handful of dates and have difficulty with intimacy of any kind and on any level with men. 

Suddenly, I meet a new guy at work. I think he is so cute. ‚ÄúWhoa‚Ä¶I think he‚Äôs cute‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt felt attraction towards someone since leaving my ex. For a second, I was kinda impressed that I felt that way, and had this moment of being pleased and proud of how far I‚Äôve come. When I started ptsd treatment, I couldn‚Äôt even look at my male therapist. It took me months. Now, four years into treatment, I find someone attractive. This is a good thing, right? 

Wrong. I am terrified. I know that on paper, this is progress and I should be feeling nothing but happiness!  Instead, I feel like I‚Äôm walking closer and closer to something dreadful.  Has anyone else felt like this before???

"My first post/Spouse has PTSD/Very long post/Vent  My spouse M73 has PTSD from childhood trauma. He is also recovering alcoholic, 10 yrs sober. I  have so many questions and suspicions about his diagnosis. It was suggested to me by a career therapy patient friend that perhaps he had PTSD, maybe 15 yrs ago. That resonated with him but he did nothing  about it, he was drinking still at that time. 

Then he got sober and wore a PTSD bracelet for a while. Then decided he didn't want to be defined that way any longer, took off bracelet after wearing for several years, never to wear it again. He seemed more accepting of his situation (mental problems) while he wore it.  I need to add, I have noticed that he gets caught up in the newest ideas or something that sounds 'cool' to him. Even if someone uses an interesting word, he'll find a way to insert that word into his vocabulary the next 2 weeks.  It's like he was really impressed by it and wants it for himself. Someone at his meetings did  namaste  (prayerful pose, bowing) and he did that for a couple  of weeks. Someone talked to him about Zen Buddhism, bam, he is suddenly intrested...for 2 weeks. Makes him look thoughtful and intelligent, he thinks, because he was raised by a mother and system where, by God, you had better be the perfect children and not fuck up, be the smartest, have the best posture, get all the awards, be class president, be altar boy, make no fusses ever, make your mother proud!  Meanwhile he was abused at home and Dear Saint Mother did nothing and she knew of it, because he confronted her. She just made herself to be the victim and said she thought his siblings would kill him if she tried to stop them. So she got a pass. I told the therapist about it and it wasn't until then that he started to face what his mother did. 

He did a heavy duty legit personality test where the therapist said she was surprised he was not a criminal or in prison. I took this to mean he may be psychotic. I have suspected that about him, but just not criminal intentions. Highly manipulative. I have long (for decades) thought he narcissistic. Fits the mold to a ""T"". 

He's been thru many therapists. I don't know how far he gets with them before he quits them. He gets defensive when I ask any question. I suspect he has either fooled them long enough, or therapist gets too close.  Every therapist has been 'the one' and then somehow, spouse drifts off, declaring he doesn't need therapy anymore. I will add that during our 40 plus year marriage, he insisted we were having 'marriage problems' and did blame me for so many things.  Every therapist we went to lasted for a little while, and truth be told, I just gave up because even the therapist believed when I said something about his drinking. He was called out on a few things, he admitted to these things, but never, until he did his 12 steps did he ever make amends to me. Our marriage is only on paper now. I have been wanting to leave for years but I have it made where we live, i.e. I get to do what I want, except have a boyfriend. I miss the sex. I'm 9 years younger. 

He is sour, critical, sarcastic, moody most of the time. When he visited our daughter in June, he came back a different person. He was happy and was actually enjoyable to be around. I started to think that maybe we could make this work. 

Then I took a trip early October for a week and when I came home, I was sick with Covid. And then last night I had to go to  emergency clinic for something else, not life threatening and not covid related. He was sighing deeply and miserable the whole time in the clinic, saying things like he made a big mistake coming early to appointment (I thought I could get in if I clocked in early, clinic was too busy for that on this day).   Now he has gone back to being sour and critical, non communicative, etc.   He doesnt' like taking  care of me when I'm sick. As long as he is in the house, that's as good as it gets. He does ask how I am feeling.  He will shop for me and get soup. He's great about shopping for me, always. He will do just about anything I ask of him, but I don't ask much of him.  I still cook meals, prepare snacks, grocery shop a little but I volunteer and have an active social life, so he does most grocery shopping. 

Just now he got up from a nap and seemed ok. He is going for a walk. If he hurts his back, he is in an even worse funk  and is grumpier and comes at me more  than usual to me.  I'm not grumpy when I get sick. I just am not having fun but still have my sense of humor. I'm extrovert, he is the exact opposite. No friends. None. Zero.   Does not like most people and criticizes the smallest thing, even people on TV aren't safe from his criticism Hair, voice, clothes. you name it. I'm low brow because I like The 3 Stooges and funny cat videos.  He spends his days playing on line card or chess, reading politics, watching political things, or seeing how our money is spent.  We're pretty low maintenance. I cut my own hair, do not do salons, more of a boho casual dresser. He kinda looks for cans of worms to open too.  

Today I am feeling so much better. I usually go out one night  on the weekends.  He asked me about my plans for the day and I said I haven't been asked out yet for tonight by my friends, but it would depend on what it is. He said, let's say you were asked to go to your usual place, would you go? I want to see how responsible you are. I must say, he has been showing signs the past month or so of being controlling again. Do this, do that. Or he'll start to tell me what to do, stop and say never mind, don't want to tell you what to do. When he already did just that. He has a strong history of manipulation, not just with me but his children as well. One daughter barely speaks to him, gray rocks him, and the other he successfully brainwashed her to think he's Mr. Wonderful, but in reality he is spiritually abusive and manipulative. Quoting the bible to her and shit like that, when he knows that is her soft spot.  I mean if he is so spiritual, why doesn't he behave that way all the time, not just with her or people he is trying to impress with his headiness? 

I see him for the basic good man he is, yet he is  phony, I see that too. I feel sorry for him that he has really never been happy, he had a wife (me) who loved him madly and he drove me away by trying to break me and he was almost successful but I got into AlAnon and learned the problem was not just him. I was part of the problem too. I allowed his behavior, fought back, said mean things. So I learned to live my own life and here we are. We get along for the most part.

I do miss male companionship, desperately. I do not want to have sex wtih him, the thought of him doing things to me turns my stomach. I'm still young, attractive, fun. I've been flirted with and just recently a man asked me if I'm married. I said yes but if my sister was not there, I think I would have committed adultery that night. 

I still feel bad for him because he seems constitutionally unable to kick and work thru his issues. He has the head knowledge...he can remember and repeat anything he reads or sees on TV, or hears from people. He just can't seem to make anything stick and put these things he sees/hears to action, or for very long. The only thing he's been truly able to do, is quit drinking. 

t's very frustrating for me, but I do feel sorry for him that he just can't seem to move off square 1. 

He does take welbutrin for depression but since this latest therapist told him he has PTSD, I have researched what meds for him  to take and welbutrin is not one that treats PTSD.  That's not to say he might still need it for depression but I've asked spouse if he needs meds tweaked. I've been told to mind my own business.  He takes a shitton of supplements. Eyes, blood, prostate health, high blood pressure, also several prescriptions but sooo many supplements. I have not said anything to him about the amount of supplements but I remember when I took a lot during the new supplements phase, 30 yrs ago or so, I felt like shit. 

I brought up divorce and he told me we would pay 40% to the tax man if that happened. I told him I looked into it, and he isn't correct. We wouldn't lose a penny to Uncle Sam. Divorce is not a taxable event.  I think he fact checked me, because that's about the time he started being decent to live with. That and the trip to our daughter, they came about the same time. 

Will this PTSD ever be resolved? I think he enjoys being miserable, a victim. And he wants me to walk down that road with him, and I just won't.

"Volunteering with Crisis Services as a Survivor, good or bad idea?  (edit: I hope I used the right flair, I'm not super familiar with Reddit haha)

After many many years of therapy and treatment, I feel arguably even more resilient than before ""what happened."" A while back, my therapist and I were talking about ""giving back"" so to speak. I've come a long way in my healing, and I like to help others. Plus, I'm trying to get out of my current field and I think it would help my resume. So, in that sense it almost feels like a win-win, at least on paper.

Despite all my growth though, I cry pretty easily when hearing others stories. I'm not sure I'd be a great fit if I get upset while someone else is in a crucial moment and needs stability. At the same, it would be one way to strengthen my resilience, but the consequences seem pretty daunting if I mess up. I don't want anyone to get hurt or feel more isolated because I couldn't be strong enough to carry them through a moment of crisis.

"What exactly is a flashback/trigger? Do these experiences of mine correspond with the definition? TW: references to physical/emotional abuse and neglect

I have a very odd relationship with the PTSD/CPTSD label. I‚Äôve been in therapy for years (love it) but when I was about 12 or 13, my therapist assessed me for PTSD pertaining to a specific event that had happened recently. I remember her saying something about how I met the criteria, except I hadn‚Äôt presented symptoms long enough. On top of that, I didn‚Äôt even feel the symptoms in relation to that event - I felt it in relation to my parents. So I did not walk away with a diagnosis.

My second therapist immediately caught onto my family life, and when I brought up how my previous therapist very briefly looked into PTSD, she empathetically told me that if she were to do the same, I would probably meet the criteria for a diagnosis. Still didn‚Äôt get diagnosed, but we focused heavily on my relationship with my parents.

I have memories of trying to describe arguments to her, and feeling very strange. I‚Äôve had panic attacks, but it was as if all of my symptoms were invisible or internal. She would ask me to describe what I was feeling and I couldn‚Äôt give an answer. The words wouldn‚Äôt come out. I thought I would burst out sobbing, but at most, only a few tears would slip out. I could only stare somewhere in the room and feel overly conscious of how shaky I felt, how my head felt like it was swimming, how my heart was pounding, how heavy my chest was. I was practically unresponsive.

My current therapist explained to me that diagnoses are really only shorthand for professionals, really only necessary like if she needed to transfer me to another therapist. She doesn‚Äôt refute my concerns about PTSD, but she‚Äôs never directly confirmed them. I think this makes me feel uneasy because my first therapist initially refused to diagnose me with ANYTHING saying it‚Äôd look bad on my resume (terrible). But my current one has also focused heavily on my childhood trauma, recognizing how it influences my thinking today, acknowledging the inner child in me that was never given proper attention, who was hurt. We will be doing an ART session soon. I very much trust her, but feel somewhat mixed feelings. But I believe that may be due to my own hypervigilance, if I had to put a word to it. And it seems like she‚Äôs actually been treating my PTSD(?) the entire time I‚Äôve been with her.

My parents had an argument some time ago. My mom remarried my stepdad who I love to BITS over a decade ago. They are happily married. He‚Äôs safe and he loves me very very much. But that day when I heard them arguing, it felt like I was on fire. I was shaking, felt like I had a hot flash, my stomach churned, and I did the most impulsive thing I‚Äôve ever done in my life. While they wouldn‚Äôt notice, I took my car and drove to a nearby park, stopped in a quiet street and sobbed in my car for 15 minutes straight. I turned off my location and was afraid to reach out to anyone, and the only thought on my mind was that I was alone and that I had to run away. Things weren‚Äôt safe anymore, and my family was going to split apart again. The danger of being on my own couldn‚Äôt compare to the danger of my house. I made myself sit down for a meal somewhere before returning home with a birthday gift for my brother, where things were fine and healthy.

When I tried to recount this day to my therapist, I was the most distraught I‚Äôd ever been in a session for a very long time. I felt the same things as I mentioned earlier, and what always stands out to me with these kinds of things is how I just can‚Äôt seem to talk. I could feel the words on my tongue but I couldn‚Äôt say them. And when I finally did, it was through uncontrollable crying. I barely felt like I was sitting on her couch there. All I could say was that I felt like I needed to run away.

I asked her how she would describe what happened to me in that session from her perspective. In my head I was wondering if this is what a flashback or a triggered state would look like, but she used some different terminology. She said that my hysteria (she reassured me it only meant that my response was out of proportion for the situation, which is true. lol) was probably because my body recognized the stimuli from my traumatic memories (yelling, anger, smells, sounds, etc) and acted as if it was happening now - because these memories become storied in the body (she said somatic memory) and get recalled under similar circumstances.

I know this is an absolute wall of text, so thank you to anyone who reads this far. Does anyone have similar experiences? I would love to hear peoples‚Äô insight. I‚Äôm very proud of how much growing I‚Äôve done, but having specific words to understand my experiences and responses would bring a great deal of comfort to me.",ptsd

"I think my ex boyfriend is stalking me      So me (19F at the time) and my ex boyfriend (20M t the time) dated for about 4 months. We were friends at first but slowly feelings started to develop and we decided to try dating. At first everything was going fine, but I started to notice his strange behavior over time.
    
    For example, once when I was at his place, we were drinking coffee with his parents (yes he STILL lives with his parents) and I noticed that he was sitting at the table with his knees against his chest and holding them in his arms kinda like sitting in the fetal position. I get it that it's his house but personally I see that as being disrespectful. Like I would try to behave somewhat normally if I had guests over. Also he would just stare at me for no reason for a really long time. Secondly I noticed that he treated me like I was his mother. Wanted me to take care of him and console him and hug him and kiss him every single second when we were together. I had asked him that does he have a mommy kink but he denied it everytime I asked him about it. He also wanted me to dominate him in pretty much every situation which I didn't like at all.

    Slowly I started to think that maybe we should break up because our relationship wasn't really working anymore. I asked if we could meet up and talk. I told him that maybe it would be best for both of us if we broke up. He clearly has his own problems that he should discuss with a professional and I said that I myself have my own problems that I needed help with. He seemed to understand but asked if we could still keep in touch. I said maybe and then he asked for a last hug. When he was hugging me he said ""maybe in the future we can try again"". In my head I just went ""nope"" and left to go home. 
    
    Afetr the breakup he continued to send me messages every single day for 2 week when I told him to stop and that he should take time for himself and also to give me space. He didn't take that well and because of that I had to block him on everything. Some time passed and things were going well for me, until I saw him at my work place. At first I though he was there by accidet but later I learned that he was working there too. (EDIT: I had started working at that place after we broke up and he started working there after me). He knew that I was working there so why on earth would he come to the same place to work? For these few months I have had this weird feeling that I was being watched. I thought I was just paranoid but it was confirmed for me because one day I was going to the dressing room and when I came out I saw him at the end of the corridor behind a glass doors and as he saw me see him he quickly ran away. I didn't see him following me or hear him cause I had my headphones on. So now he knows where my dressing room is. 
    
    I'm honestly scared because idk what he might do and idk what I can do in this situation cause he hasn't actually ""done"" anything. Why would he come to work there anyway? Does someone have an advise on what I can do?",ptsd
"Thoughts on why this may happen and ways to mitigate it? A few years ago, I re-did my bedroom. A lot of bad things happened in my ""old"" bedroom, but not so much this one. My remodeled bedroom is a safe haven for me, and Im sure I would have loved it when I was a kid. Lots of bright colors, things I collect, and girly things. I thought this change would be good for me, and it has been! But it's also posed a new problem.

 Sometimes, when I am having a panic attack or flashbacks, I start to freakout because I don't think I'm in my bedroom. I feel so un-grounded because so much has changed (ex; I no longer have carpet, my walls are totally different colors, I have a new bed, etc). It's like my brain can't wrap around the fact that I'm stil in my bedroom, and is searching for identifying features of my old one! 

I was wondering if anyone else experienced this sort of thing and, if so, how do you bring yourself back? I'm also so curious as to why this happens!

"TW: Hypervigilant about... This is a trigger warning and a trigger pleading. This post contains the topics of going to tell and topics of faith.  The trigger pleading is, please go all theological or atheological on me. I can only take so much. I already had PTSD from a long coma when I had a series of nightmares and psychotic episodes about being in hell and about being condemned to hell. I lived in horror. Now I'm hypervigilant about trying to be moral, which translates into trying to be perfect. I have to tell myself things like ""It's okay to have an opinion,"" and ""Not every thought can be positive."" I literally flinch, stutter, and stammer when I have intrusive thoughts. I was traumatized by things that didn't happen and now I'm hypervigilant about being things I can't be. I feel like it's doing something weird to my self image. Like the way I see myself is changing, or maybe diverging. On the one hand it's morphing into this canine, evil caricature. On the other hand its like, at 49 years old, seeing myself as an adult of reasonable intelligence who still has time to build a life before I end up old, alone, and broke. What can you do about hypervigilance? I've got intrusive thoughts that, when I don't take tons of Prazosin, are saying all the most terrible things and tearing at me. And the more intrusive thoughts I get about how bad I am, the more hypervigilant I get. I just want to scream, ""I reject the premise!"" That crap didn't happen, they were delusions or hallucinations or whatever the hell you have when you're psychotic.  I don't have to try to be a saint because I was never the antichrist. That last is a little convoluted, but I think it gets the point acrost. Besides bribing my doctor to up my prazosin, does anybody have any advice on how to be less hypervigilant and how to deal with intrusive thoughts?",ptsd

"One of my big triggers is popping up at work sometimes and I'm frustrated. TW: hospital  I work as a direct support professional which is essentially caregiving for adults with disabilities. Every once in a while one of my clients ends up hospitalized and I have to be at the hospital with them. So far it's only happened twice but the first time it happened I realized that seeing a hospital bed and equipment was a major trigger for me. I was suddenly reliving my trauma when I stepped in the hospital room and all my progress felt like it was reversed. Before this I was just getting over seeing them on tv so I thought I was gonna be okay to be there.

I was just starting to make progress on the overwhelming nightmares and smaller triggers again, when this morning I found out that another client is in the hospital and I would have to take someone to see her. All day I'd been dreading it but was trying to prepare myself. Well, it didn't work. I just calmed down from a panic attack after being in the room and I'm just frustrated that I have to deal with this.

Every other aspect of the job is fantastic but I dread having to go to the hospital again over the next few days and I'm not sure if I can do it.

"Got diagnosed with ptsd after an unhealthy relationship  I got diagnosed with ptsd, about a year after a bad relationship. I wonder if anyone else have tried something similar. 

At the time of the relationship I didn‚Äôt recognize it as being a bad or unhealthy relationship, but looking back at it I did everything I possibly could to make my ex happy.

During the end of our relationship I found out he had been cheating the entire time, with more people than I can count. He promised to never do it again, but of course he did and he ended up leaving me for his new partner.

All of it have left me with panic attacks, places I can‚Äôt go because I‚Äôm scared of running into him, friendships that have ended because of him, and a lack of trust to myself.

"My own Hannibal Lecter Super triggering story, I need to get it off my chest.

When I was 4, my parents (very lately, I know) decided I should be circumcised. I went in, had it done under laughing gas. That night, my mom went to undress me, and when she pulled my underwear, the fresh stitch was caught on it, and it MANGLED my little dick. Super traumatizing, right? 

It gets worse,
Had to go BACK to the hospital that night to get it fixed, and they said I couldn‚Äôt be put under twice in the same day, so my mom and two nurses had to hold my body down while the fixed AND redid the surgery. 

Turns out, the reason it was hard the first time was because I had a birth defect, resulting in an abnormally large urethra (big pee-hole on tip). 

This ordeal gave me a lot of medical anxiety, but also, now that that the problem was exposed, I was pissing in 40 directions at once, and so I had to be in and out of the children‚Äôs hospital until I was 8 for ‚Äúreconstructive surgeries‚Äù, including one 3 week hospital visit where I was in a room with a cancer kid, being rolled around in a wheelchair with a man sized catheter hooked up to me. The nurses were always applying jelly and stuff to my penis, and that coupled with the install and reinstallations of the catheter, I was heavily traumatized and resented having a penis. 

When school started again, I think I was in 3rd grade, teachers noticed I was inattentive, demure, and somewhat hostile / defensive at times. I Was diagnosed as ADHD, and a friend of my mom recommended I see a therapist. 

This is where things got really bad‚Ä¶.

The therapist recommended, I‚Äôll call him Dr. R, belonged to a small non-profit medical association that had its own private estate it ran therapy out of. The company consisted of 4 people, with him being the only one on site. 

They specialized in ‚Äúsick, dying, &/or disadvantaged children‚Äù 

It was a luxurious property, tucked away in the forested mountains. There was a main office, chock full of giant amethyst stones, a grand piano, books and toys galore, that the sessions were meant to happen in. The first time I went, I was with my mom, and I loved him. His vibrato was soft, he sounded wise and kind. At the time, I was only 8, so I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to understand he was most likely a homosexual.

 At first, it was therapy, testing me for ADHD, asking about my home life, what I thought about school. He very quickly pivoted into convincing me I was hyper-intelligent (I was, my IQ is about 150, and I was a very bright young mind), and telling me how different I was, but how that was okay, and that the world wouldn‚Äôt understand me, but he did. This made me very attracted to him (non-sexually obviously I was a little kid), and soon, my mom just started dropping me off, not staying for the 2 hours the sessions lasted. 

When we talked about my penis, I was so desensitized to the verbiage, that I didn‚Äôt understand how the questions he asked were different from the nurses. 

‚ÄúDoes it hurt when I touch it here‚Äù was a line I‚Äôve heard a million times, and he was a doctor, so I figured I should trust him. Didn‚Äôt even see a need to tell my parents my penis was being heavily discussed, let alone the touching. 

This went on for a year or two. Eventually, we were so close, he‚Äôd take me deeper into the compound where his personal home was, along with several other small structures that were still under construction. I remember getting in his truck to drive the half mile in to his house, thinking something felt off, but I had to go with him.

His house was filled with beautiful paintings, decorations and statues. Most of which depicted the naked male form. Again, it was weird, but I didn‚Äôt n ow WHY it was weird. He fed me soup, and would do things like ask me to roll a slinky down the stairs to him (was probably looking up my shorts, I was afraid to wear underwear and he knew this).

He even convinced my parents that since I was one of his favorite clients, he wanted me to pose with some other kids for a billboard / company logo pic.

They agreed, and my pic was on that site until the GOVT took it down last year‚Ä¶
 
Eventually, he flew too close to the sun and asked my mom if he could have me for an entire Saturday for a ‚Äúfree session‚Äù. And when I returned she said I looked groggy, weird, and silent, she pulled me from the program entirely. She thought I‚Äôd been hypnotized.

Nobody say my mom should‚Äôve caught it earlier, everyone thought he was weird, but he was a community staple, and the idea he was doing what he was,  was unthinkable. Also, they expected him to talk about my penis, so I‚Äôm sure my concerns could‚Äôve been wrote off as a boy call wolf situation. But yeah she pulled me, didn‚Äôt tell the police or anything though. I really can‚Äôt remember being raped, but honestly, I don‚Äôt remember more than a few snippets of being up there total, the whole thing feels like a weird blur. It felt like that even just a month after leaving‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt think about that time with him for a long time, until I met another boy in high school who said he had a weird experience with him too. We were both traumatized 13 yr olds who couldn‚Äôt understand what had occurred, but it turned into a fucked-up relationship where we would try sexual things on each other, thinking we were gay. It went on for a year (13-14, his dad was my piano teacher). I also thought I might be trans at this point, but knowing I had all this trauma with my penis, I couldn‚Äôt be sure I could trust those feelings either. 

FF to 8 years later (21 yo), I‚Äôm living across the world, engaged to a beautiful girl, working a 9-5 and paying bills, when Im sent a news article that Dr. R had been accused of grooming and serial raping a 14 yo boy on the same compound at his private residence. Once the boy came out, several men call me, saying they remember me ‚Äújoking‚Äù about being raped by Dr. R in high school, saying they think they were groomed too. I didnt know what to say other than that I was so sorry that happened, and recommended they follow up with the police. 

 Thing is, I called the police a few weeks later and said I had evidence of this happening, and that I can prove I was there. I described his personal house, the compound layout, things only a victim would know about him, they said my story lined up, but my pic on the website was the kicker. Thing is, this was pre-Diddy, and I was too slow to form a class action SA case. Their shitty lawyer helped them foreclose the property, and he‚Äôs been sentenced to 20 years (he‚Äôs already 78 or something) so there‚Äôs nothing I can get from this I don‚Äôt think, no money at least.

No amount of money can fix the levels of fucked up shit he put in my life though. 

I spiraled into drug addiction, cross dressing, self harm, risky sex and dangerous activities for most of high school, survived 2 overdoses, a suicide attempt, and a 3-month psych ward stay where they said I had ‚ÄúPTSD, OCD, BIPOLAR 1 with psychotic features, ADHd, and autism, but wouldn‚Äôt give a 17yo a formal diagnoses for anything. It‚Äôs like they were just throwing darts at a board. I‚Äôm not an insane person. TRULY, I mean that, I‚Äôm a complex person, but I never had hallucinations while sober‚Ä¶

They did however formally drug me with every atypical antipsychotic under the sun, causing extreme weight gain, brain fog, depression and anxiety that made everything worse. At 17 I was 5‚Äô10‚Äù, 130 pounds and was in AP classes across the board (even while in active addiction). By 18, I weighed 215lbs, smoked weed constantly to combat the muscle aches, and had lost 90% of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù due to  my newfound asocial behavior. 

Took years of hard-drug sobriety, therapy (EMDR, CBT, DBT, parts therapy etc.), and good relationships with new people to realize I was capable of coming back down from my years long fugue state, where I had been dissociating 80% of my waking hours. That figure is probably still around 50%, but now that I know my brain didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmake up‚Äù the Dr. R stuff, I feel vindicated, and PISSED THE FUCK OFF.

Truthfully, this started with me hoping this story could help me understand why I‚Äôm understandably confused about my sexuality and gender, but now I‚Äôm just sad this happened to me. I was such a happy-go-lucky kid before, nothing but potential, and while I actively try to be my best self everyday, it just doesn‚Äôt feel fair I had to endure this from so young. I don‚Äôt remember being a kid. I don‚Äôt remember having a good relationship with any older man in my life, I don‚Äôt remember doing things for my own sake, I don‚Äôt remember ever having any control over myself, and now that I do, I‚Äôm even more sad, because life‚Äôs too fucking depressing to ‚Äúre-live‚Äù my childhood in a healthy way. 

I‚Äôm only 22 now, and I know that time heals all, I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôve fallen on a bit of archaic wisdom with the amount of suffering I endured, but fuck, I‚Äôm allowed to feel helpless one last time. I‚Äôm allowed to be scared that I never got the chance to understand myself before the weight of the uncensored world put its pedophealic penis on my shoulders. I just want to feel comfortable in my own skin, with my own body, in my own house, and feel safe, and I just hope it comes sooner than later. 

I want to be a great husband, I want to be a loving father, I want to be an educator who is down to earth, caring and protective. I want to have sex and be able to cum in less than 50 minutes, I want to touch my body and not feel confused about how it should make me feel, I wish I could pee standing up without the other men in the bathroom hearing my piss sizzle like it came from a horse cock. I wish I could wear boxer briefs and see an in-person therapist‚Ä¶.

I wish this never happened‚Ä¶

"Is there hope Reddit? Hello everyone,        

I present myself: 35 years old PhD student, I am an European. I have a PTSD diagnosed by multiple people (therapists) due to the fight with a violent disease as a kid. It's not important to tell which one, just it was not cancer. It's a chronic one I still have it but under control. The trauma came from the symptoms, the way the disease was treated and of course the constant bullying at school. I feel a bit embarrassed actually because when I read some stories it looks like I would have no reason to complain. I am often asked to shut up about that btw.     

So anyway, I am not in very good shape,of course I fell into opioids. We don't have the opioid crisis and fentanyl is not really a thing here, that doesn't mean opioid addiction isn't a thing or common, ofc. Hopefully methadone works well so far at a relatively low dose.       

I spent the week with a girlfriend and of course was absolutely panicking and triggered all the time. She told me now she was scared for herself when I was melting down. I would like to emphasize I have never ever in my life physically hurt anyone. I would never have touched her. Of course I understand you can scare someone because it's impressive to see you crying and doing all you can not to explode your head on the wall. I understand it can be scary, I am not here to complain about her reaction which is, after all, rather normal. She lied the whole week she told me about having a good time because she believed she had to protect herself, I understand. I am absolutely heartbroken and in pieces like a broken mirror, but I am not blaming her she did what she thought was the best.

My only question is simple. Is there a way back from this nightmare? I thought I had prepared the best I could but it was a total fiasco. I don't know what to do. Because of my disease I can't even drink away my sadness. I have to face. I am in total and absolute despair and loneliness. Of course her reactions triggered a cascade of memories of when I thought ""well done"" before being said ""mmmmm sorry your emotional reaction"" blabla or ""you looked strange"" (actually tired I haven't touched any psychotrope in years except from the methadone, a lesser evil for me). I am currently living with my parents on top of that.

Anyway, thanks for those who took the time to read me. Have a good day, everyone. English is not my native language, perdon any mistake.",ptsd

"Questions for people who did exposure therapy for PTSD Hey all, so I'm working with a team to make a VR app that lets you do exposure therapy virtually to cure social anxiety, PTSD, and different kinds of phobias. We'd love to get your insights!

You don't have to answer all the questions, any response is appreciated!

1. Would you be open to trying a new technology-based approach for managing fears or anxieties if it could save you money compared to traditional therapy? Why or why not?¬†
2. How much do you currently spend (or would you expect to spend) on exposure therapy per month? Would you consider switching to a technology-based alternative if it reduced those costs?¬†
3. If there were a technology that allowed you to experience exposure therapy from the comfort of your home, would you be willing to invest in a VR headset to access it? What factors would influence your decision?
4. How important is flexibility (e.g., time, location) when it comes to choosing therapy options? Would you pay for a subscription-based service that lets you manage your treatment on your own schedule?
5. Would you feel more comfortable paying a one-time fee for an app or subscribing monthly to access a wider range of features and ongoing updates? Why?
6. How much would you be willing to spend monthly for a subscription service that provides effective, at-home exposure therapy experiences?
7. If a subscription-based app offered features like progress tracking, customized experiences, and expert support, would you consider it a good alternative to in-person therapy?¬†",ptsd
"Service animals for PTSD are service animals for ptsd a thing? i ask because i have a belgian mali who, whenever i have an episode, tries to get me to sit down and pet her. she has done this ever since she was a puppy, and her trainer, who also has ptsd and a belgian mali, says that her dog does this as well and has trained him to bring her gauzes for her attacks. could a dog be trained to service for ptsd attacks? or would this be more of an emotional support thing?",ptsd
"Realized I may have PTSD So I am a veteran, not combat, never been overseas to a warzone. I was however a direct report of someone that I did not get along with who murdered his girlfriend (David Michael Vega, can find news articles) as well as being present on base during the 2014 Fort Hood shooting spree. I never thought much or swelled much on it but now that I have a company helping me apply for benefits, things are starting to piece together.

My ever so lovely wife has over the years told me I can be emotionless/uncaring and I can get pretty mean, which is suppose from an outsider perspective is true but I am never violent. I don't have many friends by choice, I avoid crowded areas and generally prefer to be at home which I have a security system watching all entrances that is motion activated to send me alerts. To me, this is just normal and sensible.

After talking to a medical professional of the possibility of having PTSD, it made me realize maybe that is why I am the way I am. My first marriage did not work out and didn't end on great terms as we grew very distant emotionally and went out separate ways and have not communicated since. I also had a contract job I was let go of unexpectedly where they had me go into another building to tell me while they cleaned out my desk ask if they thought I was gonna have a violent outlast or something. I've never been a violent person. 

So yea it's all making me think that I might have PTSD. If the VA approves my claim I plan on talking to a medical professional about it to better understand it and hopefully improve my behaviors with people.",ptsd
"Just got diagnosed  Hello, just as the title said I got freshly diagnosed today!

I've had my suspicions but I never really thought much more about it, so at least it wasn't that of a big surprise?

I proceeded to tell my Mother the news over text. (I'm aware not the best thing to do, but she is still at work and I wanted to have it out as soon as possible.)

She left me on read for a few hours after and just called me to ask how I am, I was a bit anxious after she hadn't said anything for that long but she didn't seem mad.

There were times where she denied me having any trauma because ""I'm just a kid"" her words, not mine. So this went a lot better than expected. I'm 16 turning 17 soon.

I went and bought myself a Spiderman plushie after because honestly I deserve it.

"i hate my ptsd cw: abuse and sa  i was recently diagnosed with ptsd about three weeks ago, and my life has been a living hell ever since. i can‚Äôt sleep. my dreams are filled with memories that turn into nightmares. topics that wouldn‚Äôt normally trigger me send me into a full blown panic. i can‚Äôt even talk about current sa cases in the news without taking it personally. 

the other day, my bf and i were talking about this (like the recent diddy case), and he was trying to say something, and i just took it personally. and compared it to my own trauma. this wasn‚Äôt the smartest idea, because i ended up having a breakdown. 

apparently, i‚Äôve been comparing the people who‚Äôve wronged me to my boyfriend, and i don‚Äôt even realize that im doing it. i don‚Äôt realize that im bringing up my trauma more often. and obviously that‚Äôs not fair to him. to anyone, really. 

i hate that i can‚Äôt stop thinking about what happened, and how dumb i was for letting my mom take advantage of me, and how i should‚Äôve stood my ground earlier. how i could have been better off financially if i had went no contact earlier. how i wouldn‚Äôt be upset if i had talked to my mom about it boundaries, because when i look at my boyfriends family, i realize that ill never have that. 

i hate how incredibly lonely it feels. i hate how i can‚Äôt go to my siblings because im no contact with them as well. i hate how my moms scare tactics hindered me from exploring my sexuality, so now ill never be able to explore it. 

i hate how my trauma has effected my relationship. my mood. my memory and lack thereof.

"Left a DV relationship and can‚Äôt stop having panic attacks on specific days I (34f) was with this guy (30m) for 3 years. The abuse started in the first 6 months and I kept forgiving and returning because I have mental illness and so does he. I felt like if I left I was abandoning him and that was actually a projection of my own fear of abandonment. 

Finally in September, I called the police and got out of there for good. Went no contact, moved in with family, and got on meds and therapy (currently just telephone therapy every 2 weeks) which I feel like isn‚Äôt enough. 

My whole point of posting is I realized I have 2 really awful days a week, Sunday and Thursday where I‚Äôm extremely anxious, and have frequent intense panic attacks. Then it donned on me that Sunday was the day he went to work and there was always some physical and mental abuse on that day because he didn‚Äôt want to go to work and would take his frustration out on me. Then Thursday was his day off and he would be so angry and grumpy from working we would usually fight pretty badly. 

It‚Äôs just really hard to deal with because on the other days I‚Äôm fine and then it‚Äôs like my body knows it‚Äôs Sunday or Thursday and BOOM I‚Äôm back to feeling like complete shit. 
 
Is this normal with PTSD? To have specific days that trigger you even when you don‚Äôt acknowledge the days? I don‚Äôt know how else to explain it. I just want to move on and feel better but on those days my anxiety meds do nothing and I feel like I‚Äôm going to throw up the entire time.

"Friend is an alcoholic in on and off active addiction. Lost father from alcoholism. In need of advice and support  If you‚Äôre triggered by substance abuse, please don‚Äôt read this any further. To make a long story short, almost a year ago, I became friends with my neighbor. She told me she was newly in recovery from addiction. To be honest, when I heard that, I did start to worry. I lost my father from alcoholism a few years back and have dealt with extensive addiction issues in my family. I‚Äôm diagnosed with CPTSD due to severe childhood abuse and neglect, a lot of that trauma came from the hands of my alcoholic father. This friend talks extensively about her addiction to me, and in April, I had to set boundaries that I can‚Äôt be a support system in the way she‚Äôd like me to be due to my own trauma. Since then, she has relapsed multiple times. She has gone to rehab, came home to her parents that are extremely religious and don‚Äôt at all understand addiction, then she immediately relapsed. She has been drinking and driving. The day before yesterday was her most recent relapse, and I have reason to believe she was drinking and driving again. I have extremely low tolerance for behavior like that, because that‚Äôs something my dad did with me in his car frequently. He could have killed me due to his selfishness, and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôll never forget. I do not take putting other people‚Äôs lives at risk lightly, because of how many times I could have died. Not only that, but I was with my father as he was dying, and she knows that. Anything involving death and potential death I cannot handle.


She wants to see me, but I do not want to see someone in active addiction. I was a people pleaser for years, but lately, I‚Äôve been learning more and more how to prioritize and protect myself. I don‚Äôt think I can remain in this friendship if this keeps reoccurring. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know how to approach this. She knows in detail what I went through with my dad, yet she still thinks that out of all people, speaking to me about her relapses, etc. is acceptable. She put a trigger warning on the text, but quite honestly, that isn‚Äôt enough. I cannot for my own mental health be of any support to her without destroying and triggering myself, having flashbacks, and I don‚Äôt think she gets that. I love her and care about her, but I‚Äôve had some other issues arise within the friendship as well, such as constantly contacting me, then relapsing continently after I don‚Äôt respond, among other things. Which, to be honest, is triggering for me and does make me feel responsible for her. I‚Äôm Autistic and chronically ill, need my alone time, and cannot be with someone physically or be in contact with someone constantly. No matter how many times I try to explain that, it‚Äôs like she never gets it. I don‚Äôt think she at all means for me to feel responsible, but I do. I cannot help someone in active addiction without feeling like their life is in my hands due to what happened with my father and other family members. I quite honestly can‚Äôt even speak about addiction in general without graphic images of my father popping into my head. I can recognize that‚Äôs due to trauma and not her fault, but to protect myself and heal further, I cannot ever feel like I‚Äôm in a situation where I feel responsible for someone ever again. I can recognize that she deserves support, but this is support I cannot provide her. If you have any input or advice you can give me, please do, because I‚Äôm at a loss right now on how to handle this. I worry that anything I say won‚Äôt be received well, especially because of the state that she‚Äôs in. ",ptsd
"PTSD and Physical injuries are a strange combo.  So about a month ago i tore my ACL and im currently getting treatment. Strangly enough now that im injured i feel so, i dont know, protective over myself? Like, im injured and cant really walk without pain -> im vulnerable and i need to protect myself. Men that get too close to my make me feel like im in danger and god forbid i accidentally stay out past 7 pm which is when the sun sets. Due to this + the pain i feel so defensive and angry, and while my rehab doctor is really kind he is male, though thankfully he has an aprentice with us so i feel safer. 

This is half a vent but also just really intresting to me. Iike, how trauma and PTSD twists an injury from ""ow i am hurt"" to ""this puts me in significant danger as i cannot fight or flee.""

Has anyone experienced this? I feel like its such a weird (and exaughsting) experience.

"Did you do this as a kid? I was recently talking about some childhood experiences with my bf and somehow the topic of locking the bedroom door came up. Growing up, I was never allowed to have my bedroom door shut unless I was changing clothes, and I couldn‚Äôt lock the bathroom door until my younger sibling was born. Anywho- due to a lot of past experiences I remember always preparing myself to stay locked in my room for an extended period of time if worse came to worse. I used to stash snacks and water in my room, made sure my tissues were replenished, and always had a lot of random hobbies, books, and other things around too. I asked my bf if he ever did this as a kid, and he thought I was weird. It was like a game to me, and I continued to do it everywhere I stayed as I grew up. I would think to myself, ‚Äúhmm, how long could I survive in my room if I had to lock myself in here for an indefinite period of time? Which stuffed animals HAVE to be with me when things get bad? How long would these snacks and water bottles last me if I rationed them out?‚Äù I never thought about it until I talked to my bf, but now I realize that was not normal behavior.

"I'm worried that PTSD might cost me my job I have a great job that I've had for about 8 months. It's a warehouse job with good pay, insurance that pays for therapy, and most importantly a great boss. There are two major problems though. 

1) While the schedule is normally fine and the environment is normally relaxed, when things get busy we have to work extra days and extra long hours. It's not only stressful because of the extra time but also the environment gets very hectic.

2) Part of the job is driving 18 foot trucks for deliveries and pickups. I was doing fine with it at first but unfortunately got into a couple of minor accidents right when I was getting into a good rhythm with it. The driving now makes me incredibly nervous to the point that it's unmanageable with my PTSD symptoms. I've talked to my boss about this and he's been happy to work with me on it. I can't (and don't want to) stop driving all together but I'll only be assigned to easier things for the time being and my boss has told me I can always say no if I'm uncomfortable with something.

The only reason I'm worried about this right now is that I had to leave work today during one of the busiest weeks I've seen because I got overwhelmed, started having flashbacks, and couldn't pull myself together. I also missed work a couple weeks ago because of a meltdown that kept me up until 4am the night before. I feel like it's gonna snowball until I miss too much or can't do enough and they end up letting me go.

It's kind of hard to know what symptoms I have/had since a lot of the mood symptoms I can recognize I had when I was younger (like anger issues & irritability) but I was treated for those things.

"Ongoing amnesia? I have been talking with my therapist about my dissociation and he recently said that my dissociative episodes were part of my PTSD. I will talk to him about this, but I haven't gotten to it yet: I do definitely experience derealization/depersonalization, but I also experience periods of amnesia (I guess?).

When I read about amnesia and PTSD I mostly see discussions of amnesia around the trauma, which I have. However, I also experience loss of time on a regular basis, and it feels different than my other dissociations (in fact, it feels like nothing at all, because I just realize time has passed and I don't know what happened during that time).

I experience this on a daily basis for what must be short periods of time (maybe 10-30 minutes?), but I have experienced longer lapses in time. For example, in undergrad I remember heading to my 1:00 class at 12:45, walking straight there, and then when I arrived, everyone was gone and I realized it was about 4:30, but I had no memory of what had happened over the last few hours. It is like I'm time travelling.

I also have memory loss that I think might be related, such as people knowing who I am and my friends telling me that I've met them multiple times, but I have no idea who they are. Also sometimes I will see men on facebook or in person who I feel like there is a 50/50 chance I hooked up with them but I just can't remember (though this makes more sense to me because my trauma seems to relate to men). And I have dated men for several months who I really liked, and then I completely forgot they existed until many months later and then it was too late since I appeared to have ghosted them.

Do other people with PTSD experience anything like this? I feel very alone and I don't understand what is happening.",ptsd
"Struggling immensely in college, need advice on what steps I should take next. For context, I'm trans MTF, I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome and ADD(which would now be considered Autism and ADHD) at an early age, my parents are divorced(both with new spouses), and I have had at least one prior traumatic event to this(I honestly don't know if I have forgotten trauma, I would say it is likely though since I believe my (self diagnosed)ptsd started when my parents were going through their breakup, which was when I was 5).

Ever since the start of the lockdown(I was in the 8th grade at the time) my grades have gradually been declining as so has my mental wellbeing. During the start of high school I was still doing okay in class, although I knew it wasn‚Äôt going to be that way for long, I was a stupid teenager so I never did anything about it back then because as long as I passed, my grades didn‚Äôt really matter to me. In grade 10 I decided to be stupid and started vaping, weed and nicotine, and hung out with ‚Äúthat‚Äù kind of group. I also started cutting myself at around this time.

During grade 11, My parents found out I was cutting myself, my dad lifted one of my sleeves during DINNER, IN PUBLIC because he suspected it(looking back it was quite obvious I was), once we got home he basically just told me to stop doing it(I don't remember the full conversation but that's basically how it went), he showed almost no sympathy. later on in the year I lost my job one day and my dad physically assaulted me, and we yelled and screamed at each other and it got very personal(specifics, I couldn't stand it anymore so I ran out of the house(there's more to the story, I‚Äôm just trying to keep this short), I called my mother, who called the cops. My mom told me to run to a location, where my grandfather was and I was (physically)fine from there. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING came from this. The police did ABSOLUTELY JACK SHIT even though there should have been evidence, because of the camera's inside of my fathers house. This was the only time that I can remember he physically abused me, but he‚Äôs always been emotionally abusive. After the incident, I decided I didn‚Äôt want to see my dad for a while. This only lasted a few months before I decided to give in to him pleading with me to come back. The results of this are quite obvious, more emotional abuse but never physical. Eventually I decided to live with my mom again full time, although I did still see my dad once every while. I ended up getting another job at a grocery store. It was around this time I started trying to come out to some of my social group. I also stopped hanging out with the group I was in currently because obviously they wouldn't accept me as most of the group was edgy boys, I never stopped vaping nicotine and weed. now I was more-so hanging out with ""computer nerds"" and the like. I had always been interested in technology, and was really into gaming, I decided I wanted to be a game designer.

During grade 12 I continued to hangout with this group and things we're good overall, apart from my grades still. One day I heard there would be a party and that a lot of my friends would be going, I went, had a good time, and left. Then the next party came around and I left that party in an ambulance because I didn't know that 1. I had low blood pressure and 2. that weed lowers your blood pressure, and when your blood pressure drops too low, it'll cause a syncope. My parents both wanted me to get at least a college diploma and I wanted to as well. I just wanted to take a year off of school to focus on my mental health, but NOPE, my mom and sister ended up basically forcing me otherwise(their reason being if I take one year off it would turn into 2,3,4 years, etc) and I applied to an advanced program for computer programming at the same college my sister was/is attending. at this point I was getting mostly 50's and 60's. but the one class I was struggling with most was my coding class. I just didn't do any of the work because I talked to my friends the entire class, I would have probably gotten around 20% if it weren't for my amazing teacher, who I kind of lied to, saying I was just burnt out. He let me pass with a 50. I kind of regret telling him I was burnt out, I should have let myself fail, it would have been for the better I think.

After my 18th birthday I had to stop seeing my therapist as they only help with children. I started estrogen and hormone blockers, but after a month haven't gotten any since I suck with remembering appointments(actually I suck at remembering in general now). I ended up getting into literally the only college I applied to, anyways, here I am now, 7 weeks of past due work and getting about 0% in all but 2 of my 6 classes. I've tried the free tutoring the college offers already but that hasn't worked because it's been too slow. going forward, my mother suggested I stop taking estrogen temporarily because I'm not ready for the emotions it brings, which is fair, and she said I should start taking Adderall again(I was on Adderall for a little while during elementary school and it helped me with focusing). I've contacted my student success advisor and have a meeting with them tomorrow, and I'm going to see about switching my program to something hopefully more achievable.

This is all really worrying to me because mainly it's my education, but also because my dad actually paid for it and he's quite obviously unpredictable with his decisions.

At this point I don't even care I was wronged and just want to see if I can finish my education, then get the professional help I need, so any advice is great, feel free to ask questions if you have any. I know I'm most likely just fucked in this scenario but I want to at least try. Sorry for the long rant, I just feel as if my issues are deep rooted and I need to give an entire life story about them for people to properly understand me, and if this isn't allowed here I am willing to take it down.

I‚Äôm a college student in my twenties. I know the word ‚Äútrauma‚Äù gets thrown around a lot nowadays but throughout my whole life I have been severely traumatized multiple times. From multiple suicides over terminal illnesses in my close family to having to survive severe domestic abuse and sexual assault.
Yet I am still grateful for the good things in my life. I was born into financial stability. I have incredibly supportive friends. I am physically healthy and I have been able to experience a lot of beautiful things.

Although I am grateful and I practice gratitude, I feel like I haven‚Äôt experienced actual joy since I was a little kid. I go on a lot of adventures with my friends. I travel. I go to concerts, movies, festivals, museums, good restaurants but I don‚Äôt feel joy. Sometimes I get a sense of fun from these activities but even then - once I get home, I am back to being trapped in my miserable mindset.

I feel like no matter how hard I try, I won‚Äôt get better. For years I have been going to the gym and practiced different sports multiple times a week. I eat healthy. I drink very rarely and don‚Äôt do any other drugs. I get enough sleep. I stay on top of my self care routine. I keep my place clean. I do well in college. I have been in therapy and working on my mental health problems for over a decade. Tried different therapists, doctors, therapy approaches, medications. I talk to my friends. I support my community. I am open to new things. I practice positive thinking. I go out in nature regularly. I get my bloodwork done and my physical health is great. I also make sure I don‚Äôt obsess over leading a perfectly healthy life. I let myself rest when I need it.

And still, I am unhappy. All the time basically. The only time I feel happy is when I am in love and I am loved by (or at least get attention from) a man. No matter how much love and attention I get from my friends and family it doesn‚Äôt bring me nearly as much joy as romantic love.
When I am in a relationship, I turn into the happiest person alive. I could puke glitter and rainbows because I get so high off romantic love.
This addiction has led me to stay in incredible toxic, often life-threatening, dangerous situations.

My boyfriend and I started dating 8 months ago. I truly love this man. We have so many things in common and there‚Äôs not one dull moment when we‚Äôre together. Everything I do is for him. He‚Äôs told me multiple times that he has never had a woman care for him like I do and I believe him. It is borderline insane how hard I try to make him happy. This is my third serious relationship. Recently I have found out that he has been cheating on me online since the day he asked me to be his girlfriend. I am so incredibly hurt. I get physically sick to the point of throwing up thinking about it and my thoughts won‚Äôt stop racing. The only time I feel okay again is when I am with him. (As dumb as it sounds, I believe him when he says he loves me. I knew from very early on that due to his own childhood wounds he has an extreme need for validation. I just didn‚Äôt know that he would go looking for it in other women. I want to be optimistic, but I have a very hard time believing that he will change.)

I just want to stop being dependent on men. I want to be able to experience happiness outside of a relationship. I want to be content enough with my life to a point where I don‚Äôt need to stay in terrible relationships because it‚Äôs the only way I can feel okay for once. I feel like I have tried so many things to build a nice life for myself but nothing works. Is there anyone else who has felt like this and was able to fix their problem?",ptsd
"I just want to get back to my life Long story short, the last 4 years have been a living nightmare. All I want to do it move on, get a job, get an apartment. I'm tired of being in recovery programs. I feel like I'll never get out from under the shadow of this hell. I'm so tired of missing out on my own life. Sometimes I wish my trauma was my fault so at least I would have something I could change. But it's just... unfair. I worked my ass off in school. Got good grades, but all that means nothing after suffering from psychosis. four times. while going through gender transition. I'm over six months sober at least. I'm so tired of being dependent on my parents. There is so much I want to do but. I'm just not the same. I never really will be. It's just not fucking fair. It's been two years since I've had any income. It wasn't supposed to be like this. ",ptsd
"Tried psilocybin and left despaired after reliving all my traumas on loop. Worried what a second trip will be like. The tl;dr version:

I had immense childhood trauma due to nearly dying from health issues several times that I always pushed away for nearly four decades. I have spent all these years constantly afraid of dying and losing my loved ones, and suppressing those thoughts when they popped up. I've lived with chronic anxiety. I did lots of therapy and medications, but nothing worked. I heard psilocybin does wonders for mental health. Recently, I went on my first trip ever, a facilitated 2.5g shroom/25mg psilocybin trip and it was horrific because I relived all of my traumas on repeat and felt utter despair that anything bad could happen to me or my loved ones at any moment and there is nothing I can do. I was left destroyed, just hopeless and despaired. Days later, all I have are the memories of my traumas in the forefront and hopelessness about life. I am scheduled for another 2.5g shroom/25mg psilocybin trip in a few days and am worried that it will be the same and am worrying if it's a good idea for me to do. I was wondering if anyone has experience with trying psilocybin with their PTSD and if there's any hope that the second trip will be different and healing.

The details:

I nearly died multiple times in childhood and had multiple horrifying medical experiences. Afterwards, I was left very anxious and frightened all the time, but like the doctors told me to, I pushed the bad memories away and tried not think about them. For nearly the four decades since, I have been constantly anxious to the point it impacted my ability to get an education or have a job or do anything with my life. I've spent these years always afraid of dying and of losing my loved ones and constantly pushing those thoughts out of my head. I tried loads of therapy and loads of medications, but nothing ever worked even the slightest.

Recently, I got into a program where I could (legally) try two 25mg doses of psilocybin (2.5 grams in shrooms) with a facilitator present and non-directive prep and integration sessions (basically them hearing me out, but not giving any instructions or feedback). I had heard that psilocybin does wonders for mental health issues and allows you to see things different and reduce anxiety. I did the first trip recently and it was awful. I was forced to relive all of traumas I'd been suppressing on a loop, having them happen again and again over those hours. The only thoughts in my head on repeat for the whole trip were that anything bad could happen to me or my loved ones at any moment and there is nothing I can do. I felt and still feel utter despair and immense pain. I cried the whole time. The facilitator tried to comfort me throughout and was attentive, but nothing helped. I left completely drained with memories of my traumas at the forefront and fear and hopelessness about how anything could happen to me or those I love at any moment. I've been stuck like this for days. I'm having trouble sleeping and cannot engage in activities I once found even slightly comforting because all I can think about is impending doom and all I feel is constant fear.

I am scheduled for a second trip with the same dose (cannot be lower) in a few days and I don't know whether it's a good idea. The facilitator said it could be good because I've been suppressing/avoiding all my childhood traumas and now they're on the surface and another dose might allow me to discover more about myself that hasn't come out yet. I'm worried that what I'll experience again is hours of reliving my traumas, being bombarded with thoughts of death and feelings of complete despair. I'm wondering if it could destabilize me even further and I'm scared of being like the me just 20 years ago who was afraid to even go outside alone or turn off the lights to go to sleep.

I'm looking for advice or insight from those who have experience with psilocybin for their PTSD and whether there is any hope that going on another trip could provide me with healing rather than just brutal exposure to my trauma and fear. ",ptsd
"Is PTSD genetic or not? A prevalence rate found in the 1950s suggests that about 10% of World War II soldiers had PTSD at some point; (Same trenches, same shelling, same conditions. Why only 10%, if not genetic?)
We will immediately think that they had a genetic predisposition, but we don't know how their childhood went, it is very possible that those 10% have lived in an emotional environment, depressed and had childhood trauma (did not receive support from the family
after trauma) the tragedies of the war have already caused PTSD.

"How to help my husband cope? Background: my husband is a navy veteran. He got out 8 months ago, and I do believe that caused his ptsd to be worse. He's been throwing himself into work and I have been desperately trying to find a work from home job but am so far, unsuccessful, so him quitting his job is just not feasable at this point. We have been trying to get the ball rolling with the VA but it's been slow going. We do not make enough to afford therapy through our health insurance but this health insurance was all we could afford. Financially, we are barely making ends meet at this point and I can tell it frustrates and depresses my husband that he works so many hours a week and we can still barely afford groceries and rent at the same time. I've tried to find small jobs to do so that he could afford therapy even just 1-2x a month but I can't find anything long term that would allow me to stay home with our son, and we can't afford daycare either. We are very much stuck between a rock and a hard place until he gets his first VA appointment to establish care and can seek therapy through the VA.

I'm looking for advice on how to help him cope with everything until we can get him to be seen at the VA. They keep canceling and rescheduling appointments further and further out and I can tell my husband is struggling. Its just getting worse and worse. I'm scared and I don't want to lose him. I know that nothing except therapy is going to truly help but I just need him to make it until he can actually be seen by a therapist.

"TRIGGER WARNING - Help? Trauma Response to Seeing Young Children The past few months, especially these past two weeks have been the toughest time in life. I‚Äôm not going to get into all of it - primarily, I witnessed and interacted with unintentionally, a deceased baby while working down in the SE, US after the recent catastrophic storms. 

My main issue has been now, I can‚Äôt deal with seeing, hearing, or feel any joy when I encounter young children. Worst of all is that I have a newborn nephew, but have since asked family to not send any more photos or videos of them because I can‚Äôt get that dead infant, or it‚Äôs poor siblings who were with their mother (squatters) out of my head. 

I‚Äôve progressively gotten worse, have tremors while working in the heat, doing dangerous work, while driving, and have experienced what a trauma therapist confirmed is now two major psychotic breaks that genuinely have me terrified.

The desire for any sort of comfort from someone is equally met with absolute repulsion to talking, being touched, or letting anybody get a glimpse of how I truly feel. The mask is getting heavier to wear but the prospect of it falling won‚Äôt let me allow it to the degree I‚Äôve had many instances of crying, laughing, and screaming all at once in my vehicle.

"Help identifying physical responses? I will be keeping everything vague here, but recently I was able to recall an event from when I was about 4 or 5 years old. I decided to share my memory with my stepfather since I‚Äôve always gone to him for support, but when I tried to put words to what had happened, I felt a slew of physical sensations I can‚Äòt say I‚Äôve ever felt in response to my emotions before.

I felt heat, almost like a hot flash, and my chest felt incredibly heavy. I realized after a moment that my breathing was a bit shallow, and that it felt more laborious than normal. My heart was pounding. I could feel it in my throat, and my stepdad told me he could feel it as I sat flush against his side. But what stood out to me most was how I couldn‚Äôt seem to talk. I knew the words I wanted to say, but it was like they just got caught in my throat. I felt myself tense when I tried to push through it. I was eventually able to recall it verbally, but I‚Äôve been left wondering what happened ever since.

"Odd moment of clarity  I've just had a very disturbing moment that I need to talk about, and am curious to hear others' stories if anyone relates to this. 

CW for SA, as flair states.

I have been in abusive relationships for over a decade, and recently realized (as I'm having intense flashbacks and regressive symptoms) that I hadn't been allowing myself the space to cope or process. 

The past year has been rough, mentally. I've had increasingly worse flashbacks with subsequent outbursts and verbal shutdowns, and feelings of emotional regression. Simultaneously, I feel safer than I think I ever have and am grateful to have a solid support network and healthy home environment.

It's 1:30 in the morning and I've just gotten out of the shower after trying unsuccessfully to sleep. Insomnia has been rampant. 

As I'm drying off, I'm talking myself down from anxiety, assessing why I feel so wound up every time I get into bed even after nearly falling asleep all day. 

*""I'm not going to be raped, here.""*

This thought is so stark, so heavy and sudden, I feel like the wind has been knocked out of me. 

I don't have to worry about waking up to someone on top of me. I don't have to carefully assess the energy in my bed before drifting off, don't have to save strength to perform things I don't want to so I can go to sleep. I don't have to worry about a fight breaking out, or feeling disgusting. I don't have to be afraid when my partner's arm falls across my waist, or they snuggle up against me. 

Nothing I don't want to happen is going to happen to me while I'm resting after a long day. No one is leering at me. I don't have to cover up to avoid being objectified in my own bedroom. I don't have to be afraid of my clothing choices, the scents I wear, the way I move or sit or speak. Hypervigilance has no home, here. I can just *be*.

This feels so abnormal, but I've had this safety for a year now.

My bed is a place of respite and peace. There are no battles to be won or territories to defend. I am safe. I am not going to be raped, here. ",ptsd

"Can anybody help? Any Lawyers Out There?

First, what I will say is I‚Äôve avoided posting this for 3 years, ever since it happened, because my shame was too big to even post this anonymously. 

I grew up being physically abused by my father. The ministry removed me from this household when I was 16 and eventually ended up living with my ‚Äúwhite people family‚Äù - or so I called them. They walked me through a lot of pain and trauma, and spiritually helped me regain my faith in Christ. 

One day, I set a boundary with my informally adoptive mom, and it ended up really triggering her, and she was in a daze. We agreed to take some time apart and she went out with her husband to the grocery store. 

When they came back, she was still in a daze and my informally adoptive father immediately went up to me and demanded that I speak with him in the garage. 

At this point I‚Äôm really confused, but also triggered. Because being asked by a grown man to meet me somewhere like the garage feels unsafe. I try telling him that whatever is going on is between his wife and I, and that I didn‚Äôt feel safe going to the garage with him at that moment. I wanted to talk to the wife to see what was going on, but she went in the pantry and hid. 

At this point, he grabbed me and started dragging me to the garage and with everything I tried resisting him and trying to flee. In doing so his shirt got ripped and he was bleeding from me trying to get his hands off me. He grabbed me by the neck and slammed me on the ground and started strangling me. I tried to scream for someone else in the house and he just said ‚Äú___ is not home right now‚Äù. I tried to call 911 but he took my phone and threw it across the floor. I was losing consciousness. I thought that was it. 

Somehow I escaped at the last moment and ran to my adoptive mom. I was absolutely triggered and in shock and I asked her what the hell she was doing hiding in the pantry not doing anything. She asked me ‚Äúwhat do you want me to do? Haven‚Äôt i loved you enough?‚Äù I was so enraged by her response with her awareness of my history of abuse and my own biological mother‚Äôs lack of action in the abuse, I went crazy and tried to ‚Äúshow her‚Äù what I wanted her to do which was to call the police or intervene, so I started strangling her, knowing my adoptive father would call the cops. 

I went balistic. I had never done anything like this before. But I just couldnt understand what I had done to warrant not being protected by my second mother. My adoptive father did the exact same thing my father did to me growing up, only a thousand times worse, and my adoptive mom just stood there asking me what I wanted her to do in response to her husband strangling the life out of me. 

I could hear my adoptive father on the phone telling the cops I was being abusive (which yes I was) and that I was ‚Äújust some girl who lived with them who was mentally ill‚Äù‚Ä¶

When the cops came, they blamed me for what I did but did not listen to me when I said that he strangled me first - they said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anyone bleed like that before!‚Äù He was referring to my adoptive father‚Äôs ripped shirt and bloodied arms from me scratching at him to try and get him off of me. They treated me like dirt and I got kicked out of the house and my ‚Äúfather‚Äù didnt tell them what he did while I admitted to what I did. 

When I went to ER they said I almost died as he had popped quite a few blood vessels in my neck. I had countless scratches and bruises and sustained a tear in my wrist (TFCC tear) that prevented me from working for the next 3 years. 

I was denied victim services because they went based off of my adoptive father‚Äôs report, and even though i made a report telling the police everything that he did and admitting everything that i did. 

I lost countless friendships after this incident as I either could not trust them or I was too suicidal for them to be around. 

I now live with my abusive parents because I‚Äôm too unwell to work enough to be able to afford my own place. 

I lost everything. 

I dont know what to do. He works at a church, claiming to be a Christian, and I too dont know how to live with myself after what I‚Äôve done. I feel so alone in this world and my faith is also shaken too.

I forgot to mention. Before this incident took place, there was a time where he grabbed my wrists and left bruises but I was told by Christians that it was ‚Äúmy trauma‚Äù and that i should forgive him and trust him because its what ‚Äúfathers do out of lovingly protection‚Äù. Not knowing any better I trusted this, thinking God was wanting me to forgive, hence it now being hard to trust in God anymore too/trust what I think I hear from Him. 

I‚Äôve called countless Legal Aid resources only to be told no one can help me because of the complexity of my situation. 

After all of this... My question is - is there any hope for me? Are there any lawyers out there or anyone who knows what I can do? I just want the truth to be told. I‚Äôm ok if I go to jail for it. But he still to this day will not admit what he has done and I have lost so much because of it. I also want to heal from my own actions because I know what I did was not okay.

"TW: Domestic Violence / Experiences Tw: S/A mention (not in detail)

Hi all!

This is going to be a bit of Support/Vent but it wouldn't let me pick two flairs so I wanted to be transparent as to what this entails

I am new to this subreddit as I finally caved between therapy sessions and realized I need some support from people who understand.

I was in a DV relationship for 5 years and continued to be a support for the person for 3 years after. It was physical and emotional abuse as well as S/A. I have been struggling constantly to cope with the feelings of loss and rage and sadness and the empty feeling of not being able to access the same love and emotions I could with my abuser. Sometimes it feels like we were married, we never were but I felt like I had a connection with them on a level deeper than I have the capacity for anymore- which is strange because towards the end I didn't even want to be in a relationship with them. I don't feel how I did toward the end of the relationship when I have emotional triggers- I feel like I'm staring at the version that messed me up the most (1 to 2 years in to the relationship)

I am in a loving relationship now and have been for two years but I have realized that not all the memories I have are bad but they all hurt the same. I thought flashbacks were only negative moments? I can mostly forget about the memories in my day to day but when I'm reminded it floods back all the good and bad and makes me enraged and upset to the point of crying and wanting to scream. I don't necessarily get visual flashbacks like I'd expect to but I have a rush of emotion where I feel like the feelings in my body need to come bursting out it feels like I'm standing in the room with them again. It feels like I'm looking right at them.

People keep telling me to write letters and burn them but I'm so angry and upset I just want closure and I can't figure out how to heal - the only closure I can see is being able to get it out directly to the person as nothing else seems to work and no one understands this.

I went without triggers and nightmares for a long time but suddenly it's flared up again for seemingly no reason. With no specific trigger.

I guess I just want to know.. have you experienced this? Why is it suddenly back? How can I reconnect with others? How can I trust again and feel love? I feel so tired, I'm exhausted and it feels like I lost a piece of me with my ex and that I can't recover it. I can't stand intimacy as it makes me feel gross and I struggle to express my love for others. It's gotten so bad I literally start bawling once a week because I feel my current partner deserves better but I am on the road to finding medications that work for me and I'm starting EDMR after years of CBT not working. I just don't know who I am without him and I've been running for a long long time.

"how to feel safe? hi all. for years i was completely dissociated and had no memory of cocsa. its started coming back to me in bits and pieces in recent years, along with another experience that was more recent, and i have no idea how to feel safe when triggered. 

i still live in the same house as the person who did it. even though it‚Äôs been so long i feel so unsafe and so viscerally horrified at things that seem little. i have nightmares. most men seem like they‚Äôre just waiting for an opportunity and i have no way ti defend myself. i feel alone and powerless. i‚Äôm in therapy, but there‚Äôs only so much it can do while im living here. i can‚Äôt process. 

what do i do to feel safe and like It isn‚Äôt going to happen again the second i stop isolating myself entirely? it feels inevitable. i don‚Äôt feel safe in my body‚Ä¶ like there‚Äôs nowhere to hide. please help. ",ptsd
"Nightmares for a year I've just been diagnosed and am taking a medication mostly used for vets with PTSD to help reduce nightmares but I'm really not hopeful it will help (hasn't helped yet).

Does anyone have any success stories dealing with nightmares that come every night? It's been a year with maybe two nights of no nightmares I could remember and I'm starting to avoid sleep out of fear.

"Alternative word for ‚Äòtrigger‚Äô? I have needed to explain the details of my condition a lot recently, not just to medical professionals, but also to non-medical people such as friends , family, and colleagues.

I really don‚Äôt like using the term ‚Äòtrigger‚Äô or ‚Äòtriggered‚Äô when describing my response to certain stressful stimuli or reminders of past trauma. 

It makes me think of the insult used in memes etc. against people that are perceived to be ‚Äòsnowflakes‚Äô or excessively woke. I feel like the term has been hijacked so that it has underlying negative connotations now, and has been adapted into a veiled insinuation of weakness.

Does anyone else feel the same way? Am I overthinking it? Are there any alternatives that people have used so I can avoid the term?",ptsd
"I wrote this today. (Need advice) My Anxiety thru my whole life. 

Whenever i go in a professional setting where i get judged, my anxiety comes back as clockwork.

Pulse rising, chest tightening, breathing harder, stomach clenched, and muscles especially in the neck tightens. I feel like I'm standing on the top of a building, and about to fall over. Feels like death.

I know now where it stems from. My father was always critisizing me, and giving me chores, and then scream at me when they wasn't done right. Or throw stuff at me. He also put me in situations where I wasn't comfortable, like signing me up for sports I didn't wanna do. And one time he put me on a theatre stage to audition, and I had absolutely no desire to. 

Sometimes he got so angry at me, that he chased me out of the house, or even at one time, he threw me out of my home - he packed some suitcases and told me I had to move out in rage. Not sure what I had done. I must have been 13 or 14 at that time. His screming and hardness frightened me. He also wrote me a letter where he told me I was not good for the family, and I wouldn't amount to anything. 

I am still - to this day afraid I'll be homeless. I'm still having the feeling of doom over my head every day. I get extremely fearful when I have to be judged, and I feel very unloved - and I'm afraid of conflict. 

This has colored my whole life. I'm not afraid of people in a general setting, and I can be very social. But I'm constantly afraid to get hurt, og judge people around me. And I have been hurt a lot of times. 

As a kid I was bullied a lot, and I'm sure this goes into the equation also. 

I'm now 53. I keep getting stuck, but I also had a big and good life with many friends, and took many chances.  I'm very good at my job - I'm a music producer, and had many successes despite feeling this terror. I found a way.   
  
But I keep doubting myself. I keep going back to ""black"" and feeling helpless. I guess that's why I never got a family. I have learned about myself that I was afraid to collapse ‚Äì¬†if I couldn't take care of myself ‚Äì¬†how would I take care of others? 

---- Back Story ----

I've read and studied trauma for 10 years. I've been broken down from anxiety. Helpless. I have had trouble sleeping and functioning for many years. But yet, I feel like I'm managing my anxiety better every day. BUT - I still have that feeling of terror when I have to go to a meeting or meet people of influence. 

I've been to therapy. 3 times in my life (not 3 sessions - but 3 x let's say 20 sessions. I've talked to friends about this. I understand from a theoretic standpoint what's going on, but the feeling persist. I've done meditation for 7 years, I exercise and I eat right. I have learned self compassion. 

When I tried so much. Can anyone please suggest what the next step could be? I'm writing here, because I'm really feeling I need a new perspective. 

Thank you in advance. ",ptsd
"Almost got fakeclaimed trying to share my story for awareness Last summer, I was creating advocacy content for awareness on my lived experience with PTSD and online trauma. One day, one of my videos blew up (it got more than 10K views). I was really excited when it blew up, and I was really really pumped to answer people‚Äôs comments and to be able to educate people on this topic through my lived experience. This was when things started to escalate, and the videos started reaching the wrong people. Someone started claiming that I was faking my disorder for clout, and began sending my videos to some of their friends. I immediately blocked said person as well as their friends who knowingly watched my videos.

But that didn‚Äôt end from there. As people got to see more of my videos from there, they started claiming that I was stuck in a victim mentality and that I wasn‚Äôt taking accountability for wallowing, and that I was ignoring advice from therapists.

I‚Äôve never seen fake concern trolls be so ignorant as this. I was really looking forward to sharing my own experience for awareness, but then those fakeclaimers decided to ruin it and fuck my digital footprint over.

I have now fully privated my TikTok account where no trolls can reach me; only my trusted followers and mutuals can. They (along with my actual therapist/doctors) know me better than these awful concern trolls do.

Edit: for those saying not to read the comments, I do wish it were that easy. It was practically impossible to not read the mean comments, because I had to read the filtered  comments in case someone had a question for me and it didn‚Äôt go through since TikTok‚Äôs filtering system can be really strict sometimes.",ptsd

"C-PTSD and experiences with either anxiety medication, or anti-depressants, as well as alternative medicines  Hello all! I'm asking for some personal experiences (hoping for some positive ones and not only negative, though honesty is always appreciated.)

I was diagnosed with moderate to severe Complex PTSD in 2019. Since then, I've been on and off going to talk therapy, and trying natural management at home the best I can.

I have had a lot of fear of starting medicine over the years related to side effects, dependency, withdrawal, and not wanting to gain a ton of weight (I don't care about a few lbs. But I am quite  active and want to be able to stay that way). I also have two addicts for parents, and two siblings who have also struggled with addiction, so I have been very hesitant to start anything that could have high addiction/withdrawal potential. 

I have made some vast improvements mentally as far as perspective goes towards myself, my trauma and my life, but my physician, psychiatrist and counselor agree that though my mind is making progress, my body seems to have endured disregulation for so long that it's unable to get out of that cycle on its own. My counselor has encouraged me to explore options for medication (especially anxiety related medicine). 

After 5 long years of fighting it I started on sleep medicine. It took several tries and I'm currently taking Lunesta, which seems to work during certain times and not others. (I tried hydroxyzine, doxepin, Quviviq, Trazadone, and this. All the other meds didn't work or gave me horrible side effects that were unsafe or unbearable). I also have some experience with psylocibin mushrooms, which were profoundly helpful in my healing, but aren't always easy to access or physically easy to use in my area. 

I'm also starting ketamine injection appointments and would love to hear about the process and results that ketamine has brought for some of you. 

My biggest symptoms seems to be insomnia. I've struggled with it for well over a decade, and it has increasingly gotten worse. All over the counter sleep aids and herbs have all eventually stopped working. My doctor and counselor think that the insomnia is caused by anxiety related to disregulation from sleep and my room not being a safe place for me for a long time. I used to have frequent nightmares, but now I'm not sleeping well enough to dream most nights. 

Many of my other symptoms have improved with years of work, but my quality of life suffers immensely from the lack of rest and the feelings of anxiousness at times. I wake up everyday never feeling rested, always exhausted everyday. I've tried quitting stimulants, trying natural mood and cognitive enhancing nootropics etc, and I'm really struggling with this. 

My question is for those of you who may have similar issues with sleep and anxiety - what have you tried, as far as SSRIs, SNRIs, anxiety medicine, etc, and what helped you? Have they greatly improved your quality of life or quality of sleep in some way? Was it/is it worth it? Did you discontinue them at some point and how bad was it? 

Any and all information is appreciated.

"Nightmares Every night I have super vivid nightmares. I can see every detail, feel everything. It‚Äôs horrible and so so real.

I‚Äôm scared of sleeping to a point where I stay up until I pass out from exhaustion. Ive been trying to fix my sleep schedule but it‚Äôs impossible.

I wake up crying and can‚Äôt start my day properly. I can‚Äôt do anything. My home is messy, I smell, I don‚Äôt eat, I barely walk my dog.

On rare occasions where I don‚Äôt have nightmares I can clean up, take a shower, do all the stuff that I need to do. But that happens once every two months maybe. It‚Äôs embarrassing.

I need it to stop. I can‚Äôt do this anymore‚Ä¶",ptsd
"I finally decided to go permanent no contact. Advice on how to continue with day to day stuff as I process this? Yesterday, I was fully recreated into a ‚Äúbad object‚Äù again, taking the mantel with my mother and grandfather and grandmother and sister.

After blocking him when he said he was cutting me off after not responding for 26 hours, my father emailed me from unknown emails and texted from unknown numbers, using subject headings like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù before piling on abuse.

The wild part is that this time I actually never said anything. I got angry when he said he was cutting me off again after I failed to respond for 26 hours (while in Vermont with no power, to a MacRumor) and said the angry things I had to say to my step mother, who recently promised over and over again that I can talk about anything related to my father to her because she understands the hurt and anger and can separate what I have to say from the relationship she has. Well, she took those things straight to my father. At least some of them.

With my only recent input having being for him to not discuss family stuff with me while I work through CPTSD from childhood trauma like 3 weeks ago (SINCE I have FaceTimed and regularly texted to check in) as well as whatever my step mother decided she needed to tell him I said, he sent me a 12 point bullet list of why I‚Äôm a terrible person from every angle and outlining the damage I‚Äôve caused without actually mentioning how or to who (him? I mean come the fuck on I was a child!).

It shook me so badly I reached out to my mom and siblings to ask about said ‚Äúdamage‚Äù and they basically laughed me out of the room. It took like five attempts for them to realize I was seriously asking if I‚Äôd caused comparable damage to my father. But like always, he was just saying what hurts the most. What would stick with me.

So now I finally understand he most likely has BPD that is not being treated. I didn‚Äôt understand that my sister was a ‚Äúbad object‚Äù these last 5 years, I heard a very different side of the story. But we finally connected and talked about it, and I heard some of the things he said to her - things he would not dream of telling me he told her. Outright lies, and mean ones. I was living in an illusion for years, when you‚Äôre in his good sights it feels really good. You feel special and important and accepted.

But that is conditional. It can pivot on a dime, and it just did. I just got really good at staying in his good graces for awhile there.

So yesterday I made the decision to permanently go no contact. He‚Äôs taking ‚Äúuntil November 1st to protect himself‚Äù - so far he‚Äôs sent me abuse from unknown numbers every day he spends ‚Äúprotecting himself‚Äù but I guess I‚Äôm just so dangerous he has to pre-protect himself by attacking me over and over.

I‚Äôm trying to work through my childhood PTSD while new small traumas are created with this man. It is hard. I talked to my fiance and she‚Äôs going to help me not go back into the fold, is sad about the whole situation but agrees with the decision and is cutting them off as well.

How do you cope on a day to day basis? What tools do you use to do you daily activities when this stuff is at the forefront of your mind?

**TLDR: My most likely BPD father was intensely abusive growing up, like a true crime childhood level of psychologically abusive. I thought he‚Äôd worked through it but after a decade or so I‚Äôve found myself as the ‚Äúbad object‚Äù again, which I‚Äôd been for the majority of my childhood. He‚Äôs been hurling abuse for days from unknown numbers and emails as I try to heal. It is hard. Need advice.**",ptsd
"Technically diagnosed I‚Äôve always struggled with symptoms of ptsd without my awareness. Though in the past year or two I‚Äôve recovered some memories and realized I had a traumatic childhood, even beyond the fact that my parents were neglectful. I probably developed it around 1-2 years old as that was likely the height of my abuse, via family members no one should have trusted me around (thanks guys).

Been in CBT/EMDR and went through the DES-2 questionnaire. Scored a 31, which she said qualifies me as ptsd level dissociation. It‚Äôs weird to think I‚Äôve been dissociated for so long since it feels so so normal, but it makes sense since I have felt emotionally numb since I could ever remember. Wasn‚Äôt fully aware of that fact till after I started dating/trying to manage relationships. 

I guess I‚Äôm in therapy so that‚Äôs a step, but what now? I feel like I can‚Äôt work, even though I‚Äôm managing to take care of myself, but it‚Äôs been so difficult trying to get back into a flow of working and getting money for myself. It feels like even if I have a good stretch it‚Äôs inevitably going to end up with my anxiety/depression spiking and me feeling like quitting my jobs again. I‚Äôve been applying and of course hearing nothing back. Should I consider disability? I‚Äôve worked before. Most of my possible years, actually. From 14-22 I was working pretty solidly with a filled resume and busy weeks, even though I hated every minute of it, felt like I was suffering for no reason, and constantly was quitting/switching positions or talking with my managers about how difficult it feels like I‚Äôm handling things. 

I don‚Äôt know, this is more of a vent. I guess I thought a diagnosis would take me somewhere. I feel so guilty for not being able, but not working this past year has felt like such a weight lifted off my shoulder. ",ptsd
"Finding Hope I never once thought what was wrong with me could be cured and this made me lose all hope in ever feeling normal again.

It motivated me to seek help because for once I knew there was something wrong and that it was not just me.

I had a rough therapy session yesterday and when I got home all I wanted was to hold it. I got him out and the amount that I was soothed by it was insane.

"Trying to come to terms with maybe losing my friends I got really triggered a month or so ago, and picked a big fight over email with some people in a long-time friend group. One of them basically told me she doesn't believe I have PTSD, that I am just blowing things up out of proportion in my head so I can revel in playing the victim. I accused them all of being enablers of the guy who retraumatized me and made my acute symptoms come back, after they had been mostly in remission for most of 20 years. I think I have known for a while that it wasn't working out trying to cling on to these friendships, but I haven't had the heart to just ghost them or walk away. I wound up kind of trauma-dumping on them in another email, as if that was going to convince them when they didn't believe me before. 

I was stuck in fight-or-flight mode, the worst it's been in a very long time, and wasn't thinking rationally, of course. I couldn't get out of that mode for like a week straight, and I got into a bunch of trouble at work - I was in such a fog that I spent a whole day entering data wrong, and had to go back the next day and redo most of it. I was in a meeting and completely blanked on the fact that I had a due-out from it, until the head of our whole organization emailed to ask why I hadn't done it.

The girl who accused me of making up the PTSD suggested we should talk, so we set up a time, and then she got sick and had to cancel (not just an excuse, because I knew our talk was not the only thing she canceled on), and never reached out to reschedule anything. I could have just left it, but instead I took the initiative and asked if she wanted to reschedule, and now we have plans to meet in a week. I also have plans to meet with someone else who was on the blowup email. 

I don't know, am I being an idiot to keep trying with these people? I don't want to get my hopes up that things can ever really be okay between us again after what was said, on both sides; and yet I keep getting my hopes up that something can be salvaged. Am I just grasping at straws? It just feels too cruel and cold to simply give up on them and cut them off or walk away, after all the history and nice times we've had together, and all the times they were kind to me and supportive in the past. And they are care enough to talk, at least, and isn't that not nothing? Even if what we have to say to each other is, Goodbye, at least we tried?

My wife has always struggled with mental health issues but she'd been stable on meds and doing better for a while (around 3 years). Her and her psychiatrist decided to try to go down on her psych meds because she was doing better and she went downhill really fast.

She's been refusing to sleep because of nightmares, keeps having flashbacks and keeps talking about wanting to kill herself. We went to the ER after she told me she didn't feel safe and couldn't promise me that she wouldn't do anything while I was asleep.

She's been using the landline to call me and says she has been feeling awful and keeps having flashbacks and crying. She finally got to talk to a psychiatrist today who didn't even adjust her meds. After that she talked to a social worker, who wants to give her something to help her sleep (and thinks she's manic cause she's not sleeping). The social worker said that she should be able to go home in a day or two as long as she's sleeping through the night.

My wife says she doesn't think they're taking her suicidal thoughts seriously and she wants to come home. I'm scared because I don't think I can keep her safe at home but if the hospital won't help her, who will? I don't understand how they can discharge her if she's just as suicidal as when she came in. She says she still doesn't feel safe. I don't know how to help.

She has no one to talk to about how she's feeling and there isn't even group therapy (apparently the group manager is on vacation???). So she's just been sitting in her room and crying. Aren't they supposed to have people she can talk to?

I am just so worried about her and I don't know what to do.

"Prolonged exposure - dissociation/no emotions?  Hello everyone!

I am currently going through a prolonged exposure treatment. I have multiple traumas, for instance several cases of sexual abuse/assault. Now, I am quite concerned. The first time I told my therapist about the trauma (the most severe case probably) in session, I had a lot of emotions, sadness and so on. It was really horrible to listen to the recording every day of the week after that, and I was a mess, really distressed and incredibly tired/worn out, in a way I didn't expect at all (even though everyone has told me it would be though) The second session when telling the story of the trauma, I felt so numb. I felt a lot of ""I don't want to do this""/anxiety, but no emotions. Then, during the second week when listening to the recording, I felt again completely worn out/sick from the stress. I started getting horrible, MUCH worse than usual, pain in my body from the stress. I also got very distracted when listening, thinking about other things and feeling very distressed about them but not about what I was listening to. Then the third session, again, I didn't feel anything except this ""I don't want to do this""-feeling plus intense muscle pain in my body. I felt like I was failing completely. Now, when listening to the recording, I didn't feel anything again. I'm really trying to get in touch with my emotions, but I don't feel anything, just a huge worsening in body pain, which I get distracted by, plus some other distracted thoughts. I even went back to the first recording, where I show a lot of emotions, to try to bring anything out. But I don't feel anything! Just the body pain, horrible muscle pain! I'm really worried I won't get any effect from the treatment. I also experience a lot of increased distress/some suicidal thoughts (that I didn't have before) because I feel like I will never get better and I'm a failure. Any thoughts?

"Is anybody else ashamed of talking about past traumas? I was recently diagnosed with PTSD after finally convincing myself to reach out for help before it was too late. For a while, I've been trying to convince myself that I could handle this on my own, that I should be able to handle it on my own, until I realized that I couldn't.

I've had a couple therapy sessions and I really like my therapist. The community center I called specifically matched me with a therapist who specializes in trauma and PTSD after they did my intake assessment, but I can't bring myself to share things with her that are beyond surface level. She's been really understanding and patient with me so far, but I feel like sooner rather than later, she'll give up on me. I really want to give her the opportunity to help, but I just feel so much guilt. Guilt that some of the things that happened were my fault and that I don't have a right to be so affected by them. Guilt that I should have been stronger than this, that I should have been more resilient.

Is this common with PTSD or is it just me?",ptsd

I remember her kissing me and me not really liking it but her just kinda going on until she was done. But the thing is idk if this really happened. I remember it very vaguely but what I do remember feels very real to this day. Sometimes i think it was dream but the most important thing that I can remember was the actual feeling of us kissing and how much I hated it.
You don't really remember the actual physical feeling of things in your dreams the way I remember this. I remember years ago me and my older sister were having a conversation and she asked me if I had ever had my first kiss and I was like ""yeah you"" not really thinking much about it at the time as this was years after the incident but I was still really young. She just laughed about it and said it didn't happen and for years I never thought about it until recently. Now it just constantly pops up in my head and I wonder weather or not it really happened. Ik sometimes abuse as a child can be so traumatic that you forget as a lot of my childhood besides certain moments are almost completely forgotten, but I don't think this was bad enough for my brain to forget it? I don't necessarily think that this traumatized me but I do wonder if this did happen could it be apart of the reason as to why my mind is such a mess in my adult life? (I'm 20 now ) I also wonder if it is true then why did she do it? I would ask her but me and her have a pretty solid relationship nowadays so I would hate to bring up old drama plus if it didn't happen then that would be really awkward.

"Is it likely that I have PTSD? I have diagnosed OCD. I have ADHD do because it's not an official diagnosis; however, my therapist gave me the questionnaire used by psychiatrists to see whether someone has it and I met the criteria because a lot of my answers were in the grey boxes. 

I used to work in a restaurant and the staff was mean to me because I was quiet and just said hi and bye. The thing is I didn't want to get fired, so I would never fight back. Then one day a girl kept harassing me and I just lost it. I started to fight back all the time.

I was having an argument with one of my coworkers before he was leaving and he put his hand in his pocket. When he did that, my eyes got teary and I got anxious because I had thoughts that he was going to take out a knife. I didn't think he was going to do that, I got thoughts of that happening during that moment and it made me scared. All he did was reach for a pen.

One day about three years before I worked in the restaurant, I was outside and a weird stranger came and started talking to me. He was ask him "" do you know me? "" Stuff like that. I wasn't replying to him. Then he took out a knife and told me to answer him. I got so scared. Then we went back to square one and I started answering the questions and he left.

"I collect stuffed animals as an adult because my parents threw all mine away as a child. I think I wrote like 5 full on essays about how I am feeling right now and I deleted all of them, but I thought maybe I should write something bittersweet instead.

I am an adult but a few years ago after being kicked out for a while and living with a relative I bought two stuffed animals, they were dragons. It ended up completely changing my life. They brought me so much comfort that I decided to buy more, and more, and more, now I have a collection worth 8-10k (no I did not spend this much don‚Äôt worry haha, I just buy a lot of vintage/second hand and get good deals). I guess it‚Äôs gotten a little out of hand since the l‚Äôve all essentially taken over my room but it makes me feel so happy and not alone.

I had a lot of stuffed animals as a kid that I loved, but my parents threw a lot away or sold them. It was heartbreaking because they did not do this to my sister‚Äôs just me, probably a punishment for whatever it was at the time, but I lost everything, even the ones that were extremely sentimental. They even managed to get rid of one of my baby blankets to hurt me.

So this was my way of taking that all back, I just grew this passion for buying stuffed animals, specifically dogs, and maybe it seemed weird to people but it makes me happy and despite living with my parents still (for now) it makes my room a safe space. My bf said my room is super comforting somehow, I guess that‚Äôs kinda what I was going for.

I was diagnosed with PTSD last month when I finally took the step to get therapy and work on a lot of things. I kinda already knew deep down, but hearing that it is an official diagnosis hit me pretty hard. I have just not been in a good space but maybe tomorrow I will organize my stuffed animals since being really depressed they are not organized and it really bothers me.

It solidified in my mind that I am nothing more than a tiny ant, building an anthill that could be wiped out completely at any moment. You spend your whole life building goals, building relationships, working hard and chipping away at life day by day. 

At any moment, it can all be taken away in an instant by an impersonal force that is a million times stronger than you. Your death is guaranteed because you are so small compared to how large this outside force is. 

Its the feeling of complete powerlessness. This impersonal, large scale power can just end your life at any moment without warning. 

It truly makes you feel like a bug.

And I've also been having this happen every single day since my trauma just before I go to sleep too.

Sometimes when there's about to be flashbacks I get these shakes and jerks instead also, and the focus somehow goes there instead, and the flashback passes without having to experience much of it, it's like a stopper or something.

Is this what's it's like when the trauma is ""stored in the body"" like they say?

When it's awful though it gets to the point of how they used to portray possessed people in old films, these muscle movements and shakes get slower and some get stuck for a while.

"Finding out the circumstances of my father‚Äôs death brought on a whole new wave of trauma My mother and father had me at the ages of 23 and 25 respectively. They‚Äôd not been together long, and had split up before my mother found out she was pregnant with me. They got back together due to said pregnancy but split up again a couple months into my birth. I‚Äôd be between homes from then, spending half the week with my mother in her house and the other half with my father, who still lived with my grandparents. After a couple years my mother met my stepfather and moved in with him. When I started school, aged around 3, I‚Äôd only see my father at the weekend. He‚Äôd pick me up on Friday evening, and I‚Äôd go back to my mother on Sunday night. 

Every time he came over to pick me up or drop me home, I used to be filled with dread, as my mother and father would have a full blown argument every single week without fail. It was quite upsetting for me at the time and each would make a point to blame the other in front of me. I eventually got used to it, but looking back, I think this may have had a massive impact on my life.

When I was 5 years old, my father bought his first house, and the two of us would go there every weekend and spend the whole weekend together. One weekend he picked me up on Friday and I went back to my mother and stepfather on the Sunday. 

My mother woke me up Monday morning in tears and told me I wouldn‚Äôt be going to school that day because my father had died Sunday night. I‚Äôll never forget the sudden rush of numbness that overtook my body at that moment. I just couldn‚Äôt comprehend it. I‚Äôd only seen him no more than sixteen hours before, and now I was being told I‚Äôd never see him again. 

I didn‚Äôt cry at all. The feeling of sadness hadn‚Äôt really hit me whatsoever, it was more just the shock. I just couldn‚Äôt understand how he could just die like that. Being only 5 years old, my view of mortality was that only old people with grey hair and walking sticks die, not people who hadn‚Äôt even hit 30 years of age. My mother and I attended the funeral, I didn‚Äôt cry there either. Even though my mother and all my family on my father‚Äôs side were in floods of tears, I remained absolutely silent and completely numb. 

As I got older, I‚Äôd think about my father every day and would visit my grandparents every weekend instead of him, as I‚Äôd basically been doing anyway, he‚Äôd only had his new house for a few weeks before his death. I never cried about his death, and always avoided talking about it. In fact, it‚Äôs very very rare that I‚Äôll talk about it with anyone. At that age I didn‚Äôt want anyone to know and had no desire at all to discuss it with anyone. I‚Äôve maybe told a handful of friends since and those have been very recent. 

A few years ago, I was talking with my grandmother, and the topic of my father arose. She got emotional talking about it, and asked me if I knew how he passed away. At this point, it dawned on me that I never tried to draw any conclusions for why a 29 year old man in decent health would suddenly die. But it suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks, and I knew what she was about to say before she said it. He committed suicide that Sunday night. 

I felt such a horrible sense of anxiety when those words left her mouth and didn‚Äôt know how to respond. After she left, I was still processing the information but I didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I started to panic and felt physically ill. I went for a walk to try and calm myself down but I just found myself getting more and more worked up as I paced down the road. The feeling is so difficult to describe. 

Since that day, my father‚Äôs death has really had a devastating impact on me. I think about it constantly every day, and have done for the last 3-4 years, and despite having moments alone where I shed some tears over the thought, I‚Äôm still very closed off about it and try to avoid the topic the best I can. I feel like before finding out I‚Äôd managed to sort of get over his death, but since finding out that he took his own life, it‚Äôs brought everything back, only 100 times worse‚Ä¶",ptsd

"Breaking down because of childhood photos TW: SA I'll try to keep this short and I'm just looking for advice with coping or if anyone has tried something similar

TLDR of my trauma was SA when I was 10. My dad just gave me childhood photos as he has been cleaning up the house. I couldn't help but notice when comparing the pictures now after he left, how happy and ""carefree?"" I seemed before. The pictures taken after all show an obvious ""deadened"" look in my eyes, a rapid weight gain, and inability to smile for pictures.

"Dumped by therapist. (Male) Hello, not sure if this is the right forum (I rarely use Reddit, so please inform me if it is not and I will promptly delete it/also posted to others in case this isn‚Äôt the right place to put it) but my therapist dumped me. Also warning for child sexual abuse as well and animal abuse (nothing graphic, essentially a very broad rundown, I don‚Äôt know how to edit flairs or add multiple if that is possible so apologies for that).

I struggle with ‚Äúintrusive thoughts‚Äù and understanding the concept of what is and isn‚Äôt morally correct in societies viewpoint. When I was a small kid figuring this out myself with a long history of childhood abuse (sexual and verbal), I took it out on animals in a violent way (which I will not get into detail what I did because I do not think it is necessary nor appropriate - but to sum it up I was a very empathetic child to a certain degree before something clicked after an event and I just didn‚Äôt feel that way towards animals besides irritation and puzzlement), along with other rather disturbing things beyond my home life that happened to me or around me. Now as a young adult, I understand to a degree why it is considered wrong and I lay down rules for myself for the things I don‚Äôt necessarily understand to prevent acting on thoughts and urges to adhere to societal expectations and avoid any ramifications (besides a few incidents as a teenager) and would never harm an animal or person if I can help it.

However, I opened up and was honest with my therapist about my childhood (the first time I have been completely in-depth and honest about my childhood assaults and history with animals which is a breakthrough for me personally considering I‚Äôve had well over six therapists growing up and never went in depth about those things in my childhood) and she essentially said she didn‚Äôt want to work with me anymore, and heavily considered I check myself into an institution before I ‚Äúsnap‚Äù - which absolutely boggled my mind. From personal experience, wards never helped me and in fact made things worse. 

I do want therapy, but I feel like I cannot be completely transparent and honest with an individual without a recommendation like that. Therapy in the first place never really helped me with the advice they offered, but it was therapeutic enough in itself to just talk without being ‚Äúopenly judged.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be seeing any therapists anymore because honestly - I‚Äôve given up looking for one who can deal with cptsd and people with a history like mine. Not to mention the waitlist times for therapy is absolutely insane where I am and if you don‚Äôt click with one, then you have to wait even longer. Honestly, I feel abandoned by her and quite pissed at the situation considering I was trying to get help for the things inside my head only to be cast out like some stray mutt.

I just needed someplace to put this out into the open because I‚Äôm at a time where my mental health is getting horribly bad again and this really sent me over the edge because I was on my way there before I got the message she cancelled and didn‚Äôt want me as a client anymore, etc, etc. I do not know if I should continue looking for a therapist, or if it‚Äôs a complete lost cause?

"I think I have trauma from my suicide attempt, and that it's making me depressed In late January 2024, I tried to kms, it was completely botched as far as I can remember, I have never talked about it to anyone in detail because I am so ashamed of it being so botched.
I think it left me traumatized (though I am too ashamed to use this term): I had flashes when drinking heavily (I then stopped drinking), I am almost completely unable to talk about suicide or my body shuts down and I start crying, before that it was a normal topic to me. Furthermore, I dissociate much more often, which lands me in trouble in various environments, and I have many spasms that are easily triggered, and I am ashamed of my behavior.

Adding to that, there is so much guilt, not from my sa specifically, but from the fact that I have relied on many means (medication, mental clinic, doctors) and still can't get my shit together, and that my ""absences"" and my shutdowns are seriously impacting my every day relationships. I should be able to function normally now but I can't!!!!

The impossibility to talk about suicide, or land in a mental health institution again (idk why though), basically the lack of any means to get help, associated with the guilt, makes me feel like I am trapped in a situation where no one can help me.
And that every single thing that doesn't go as planned is absolutely infuriating because it's taking the few energy that I have for something completely futile, yet if I don't do it then it's all over.

I have so much anger because for the first time in my life I don't want to die, but everything is telling me that I should.
I fear that depression is coming back, and that my every effort to combat the last one is completely irrelevant towards this one that is built upon my attempt.

"scared to go home  Due to financial struggles, me and my husband had to move in with my parents, and even though at the begining it was tolerable, after I decided to talk to my mother about the sexual abuse I had endured as a teen, she's become horrible.

It was a couple of months ago that she blamed me to my face for it all, and it's increasingly difficult to look her in her face without feeling my blood boil. I have to concentrate on work and studies, but all I can think about is the empty gutteral feeling of not having a loving motherly figure. I have the support of my husband, but I know it breaks him apart as well. My mother fullfilled my deepest fear of someone close to me actually blaming me for the crimes commited against me, and i've never felt more scared to go home, but i have nowhere else to go. It's only been a couple of months that I came to terms with the fact that I was infact a child (15) when I was raped, my mother keeps on insisting, that I was a full grown adult. I never tried to blame her for what happened, it's not like she could keep a hormonal teenager indoors, but to claim that she had no responsibility in letting her 15 years old child be physically and sexually abused by another teenager seems simply absurd. Few of the break downs I've had in her presence have ended with her forcing me to take benzos, pulling a concerned face and whining about how hard it is to have an insane child, calling me a masochist for having flashbacks and other ptsd symptoms.

"How to break out of this mental prison? I want to share a very complex case with you‚Äîit‚Äôs a mental prison from which I am determined to escape. I‚Äôm working on a strategy for this and need help and support. I will share all the important facts that contributed to building this mental prison and describe the vicious cycle as it operates in my case.

I was severely abused from my early years. My mother would beat me for everything, blame me, and stripped me of all my rights. She imposed all responsibilities, duties, and obligations on me. Additionally, she would tell me that my actions were insignificant and that I could not achieve real things. Yet, she blamed me for not studying, constantly conveying that I was completely dependent on my parents, so I should study. However, I didn‚Äôt have the tools to study. She terrorized me, saying that if I did not study and wasted my time, I would end up in an embarrassing job. An important factor to consider is the daily force-feeding when I was little, every day for many years; she would beat me if I could not eat an adult portion of a meal. Because of this, my body rejected food, and I was eating only to survive. I became unhealthy and thin, and with all these problems, I also had no energy to study and concentrate. However, I tried to study but couldn‚Äôt; my head was hurting, and I didn‚Äôt have energy.

As a result, I fell into depression. I was depressed for many years at school. I did what I could; fortunately, with the remaining energy, my brain was able to learn pretty fast, at least at a sufficient level to pass exams, but that was the minimum. However, this situation instilled in me a strong fear of not being able to do anything real or important, so a bad future always seems imminent. I am terrorized and have a strong fear of the future all the time. I always feel I need to have complete control over things to feel safe or okay, but I am never relaxed; I am always anxious. Even now that I work, I feel this danger about the work, that it will not continue forever. I have strong fears that something will go wrong.

Also, whenever I imagine a good thing in the future, that I achieve something important, my brain blocks it violently. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but immediately when I start to imagine that I am getting out of this situation and building a good future, I have a kind of short-circuit feeling that violently blocks these positive thoughts and distracts me from those positive images I am building.

In a schematic way, this vicious cycle works as follows:

-	I have a goal (for example, to study or to get my job done).
-	I feel like I can‚Äôt do anything important, so I can‚Äôt study well or I can‚Äôt do a job well, no matter my efforts.
-	I lose motivation to do things because I feel I will not be able to do them anyway, and I feel depressed.
-	I feel dependent on someone else for resources (like I was dependent on my parents as a child, now maybe at work), and I am terrified that if I cannot do my job properly, I will be abandoned.
-	But I can‚Äôt do my job properly because I believe I can‚Äôt do important things no matter my efforts,
-	So, I feel afraid that I will lose a job or a source of resources.
-	Whenever I imagine a concrete plan that can work well and start to imagine a good future for me, my mind violently blocks my thoughts, which completely deconcentrates me from these positive thoughts, and I can‚Äôt get back to them for some reason.

I was able to solve the eating problem by concentrating on it as a priority, because without energy I could not do anything. But the rest of the problems remain to be solved. I have a clear picture of the major things happening in my mind but need to find a strategy to get out of it.

I tried to discuss this with different psychoanalysts; I‚Äôve changed more than 10 of them, but they could not make any progress, so I stopped searching and now I am trying to resolve it on my own. Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions to break out of this loop? What approach can I use?",ptsd
"How to deal with this? As a boy, I grew up with an extremely abusive mother. She would beat and verbally insult me daily for many years, right up until I was 13, when I blocked her hand as she tried to hit me. She was narcissistic, constantly belittling me while praising herself, and she placed all the blame on me as a child, even attributing her problems and responsibilities to me. Unconsciously, I perceived her as someone who had a lot of power and rights over me, even though consciously I always knew it was wrong. From around the age of 7 or 8, I started to understand that this abusive and unfair treatment was not normal, but I felt I had no rights, only duties and obligations, with absolutely no freedoms. Whenever I tried to speak up, run away, or take action, she would beat me again and again. I felt trapped and suffocated, which led to psychosomatic pains in my stomach due to fear and anxiety.

My father was always absent, working many hours, even on weekends, because my mother refused to get a job. So, unfortunately, she was always at home, and her extreme toxicity deeply damaged my mental health.

I have complex trauma in many different aspects. In this post, I want to talk about one of them:

For some reason, she created an image of my father as being almighty, almost god-like. I remember this from a very young age. She would always compare me to him, telling me he was bigger, much better looking at my age, and that he was perfect in school. These comparisons were daily, and I heavily internalized all these things. She would tell me I was little, and that my thoughts and actions were insignificant. So, I practically had this image of my father, but I didn't know him from my own experience, because we never played together even once; he was always busy and away for work.

Growing up, this led me to the wrong conclusion that all adults have all the rights, and I have none. Subconsciously, I always felt women were untouchable, and men were so strong that I could never match them; I would always remain small and insignificant. I know consciously it's not like this, but for some reason, it continues to badly influence my emotions. So, all older people than me have power, and I don‚Äôt, even though I am already an adult. So I feel inferior in every aspect with respect to older people in general.

This is crazy, but when I go out for a walk or just to go to a bar, I am always alert and feel danger, especially from men. I think I need to protect myself. I also feel I can‚Äôt trust women, so I practically have uncontrollable fear of both sexes. I often have psychosomatic pains in my stomach for the anxiety and fear. This is real hell in everyday life and in every aspect. I live in isolation, have very few friends for this reason, and feel depressed because of it. I'm struggling to find the motivation to move forward daily.

Do you have any resources or thoughts to share to solve this?",ptsd
"PSA reminder ""normal"" Just because something is labeled as ""normal"" or has been normalized in society, does NOT make it healthy. Normal does not mean good communication, healthy boundaries, and healthy perspective.

Therapy isn't there to make you ""normal"". It is there to help you have a functional and happy life. You dont have to be ""normal"" to be happy and functional.

Stop comparing things to what normal is as if its the end all be all. It used to be normal to chop off someones head in a guillotine. It used to be normal to abuse your wife and children mentally and physically. DO NOT LIVE YOUR LIFE FOR NORMAL.

Live your life to be happy. Try to better yourself in areas you lack like proper communication, boundaries, and emotional regulation.

This is the fifth time in the last month that I've gotten stood up

To meet you 
You fuckin suck dude
Of all the dates I've set up, the other person shows up about 20% of the time
I'm very stand-up-able I guess, right?

Am I just a tool for your entertainment
I'm fucking Charlie Brown kicking the ball

"Just found out I dissociate during confrontation I‚Äôve been working with a therapist for years about my autism and anxiety. She helped me gain the courage to talk about our childhood with my twin. My twin (nonbinary) mentioned all sorts of things that I genuinely do not remember. That our father pushed them into the oven or the verbal abuse he would put all of us under. I had no memory of these. My twin said, ‚Äúyeah you just kind of stood there, quietly.‚Äù We went into deeper discussions and I realized how many traumatic events I just checked out during. I remember some of it, like my mom hitting me, but even now I dissociate during even the smallest confrontations. It explains so much. I have thoughts and feelings that I have no idea where they came from. Now I try to pay attention to myself. I realize I stop listening and can‚Äôt actually hear what they‚Äôre saying. I can‚Äôt look at them and my eyes just glaze over like I can‚Äôt blink. It‚Äôs like my environment becomes muffled and I just enter a void. I‚Äôm working on it in therapy and everything it‚Äôs done to me but I only wonder how much of my life I have missed. ",ptsd
"Flashbacks are killing me! During my childhood I witnessed physical abuse of one of my family members who aged by that time (33,M) and brutally beat a child. This scene was repeated multiple times. I wasn‚Äôt abused, I was a witness and I feel the pain of the victim like I was the one who got beaten. Whenever these flashbacks come to me I feel down, I have the desire to end my life so these flashbacks could stop. How did you live with it?? ",ptsd
"has anyone gotten EMDR for their PTSD and if so how effective was it for you? Hey there, I got diagnosed with cptsd a while ago, due to long term traumatic events in an abusive household as a child. The aggressor was removed when I was 10 as we than moved away a year later. From childhood on all the way into my adolescent I had no therapy whatsoever, later in life I kept getting more problems around work that was not brain stimulating doing the same thing for hours on ends, day in day out, that I was seeing flashbacks from the time more and more, that I had pushed away. A year therapy later I was diagnosed with cptsd and autism, before I moved to Germany being in love there. I do wanna move back, as it wasn't what I was expecting and prob get diagnosed for ADHD.

  
In my year therapy with my therapist she eventually asked me if I was willing to try out EMDR, she explained the treatment for me and how it should work. We tried it out and that for a couple times, yet it didn't have any good influence on me, and a friend of mine also did and it didn't have a good effect on her either. She stared inot it getting flashbacks too tough to handle for her, me I couldn't keep up with the lights. The idea is that you follow the lights while thinking of your trauma so that memories get rewritten or perhaps processed faster and less intense? That is the explanation I got from it. The thing is, I stared blankly ahead, and while she told me to go back to the time of trauma, it's like sitting in a cinema, watching your life go by in a couple scenes and you are just mentally not in the world. It did not work for me, but I am gonna ask you, reader, if you have PTSD or know someone who has and you or they had EMDR treatment, how did it go and did it work?",ptsd
"Started sleep walking the last year of my toxic job and I realized today I still do     I‚Äôve never posted anywhere for any advice. I can usually figure things out put this one. I‚Äôm literally not in control of the symptom and not aware when it‚Äôs happening so I‚Äôm at a loss. I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with PTSD, but I had a hard last year at my previous job. I started hearing air sirens, and loud sounds in my head when I‚Äôd ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and it was like inception. I‚Äôd start getting ready and it would reset and at first I believed it was all just dreams until things in my room or moves and I was at various states of getting ready. Today I was going to start a new job for the first time in almost a year. I‚Äôve used alarms previously sometimes I do sleep through them, but nothing is moved. I have not had any sleepwalking instances during that time but this morning although the job didn‚Äôt start for fairly late in the day I woke up after that thought wow I missed the loudest alarm clock I could find.!??? And then unfortunately I saw things moved in my room. I had started to get ready. There were things thrown across my bathroom floor. I tried to use paint as part of my make up. I have no knowledge of any of it. I have never been a sleepwalker and never happened to me until my previous job. And I thought it would go away. I thought it had gone away. It doesn‚Äôt help that my biggest fear that I‚Äôve had in life for many years is doing things I don‚Äôt remember. I also obviously need a job and money. All of the doctors offices in my area a few months ago were booked out nine months. Maybe someone has an idea for online therapy. I honestly have no idea what a treatment for this would even be. 
  I hate that I am a person that really loves values and needs control and yet I‚Äôm having some moments that I am not even aware of.  I guess I also just need to hear from someone that might be going through this or has gone through it because I have never heard of this happening. At least no one told me it‚Äôs happened to them. Sorry if spelling is weird I used to talk to text and it won‚Äôt let me pull the cursor to the top and I‚Äôm sorry if this is the wrong place to put this. PTSD has never previously been a concern nor has sleepwalking. I was slightly concerned about those things with my previous job, but I didn‚Äôt take it too seriously and I thought once I got out of the situation, everything would be fine. I will probably look up before bed meditations that might help. Or a certain sounds, I can set as my alarm that could mitigate this. I don‚Äôt want to have to ask someone to make sure I‚Äôm awake but I guess if it comes down to that. Has anyone else had this issue? Has anyone gotten PTSD from a job? Had inception dreams where you keep waking up waking up waking up only to discover it‚Äôs hours later and you‚Äôre standing in front of the bathroom mirror thinking you‚Äôre getting ready? I don‚Äôt know any of it. It‚Äôs scary for me. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve never imagined as a possibility. For myself or even a thing that could exist.",ptsd
"Had another nightmare. I usually don't get them. This one was about bullying My last nightmare was about my parents fighting and I felt scared but I process it better because I love my parents. Today's nightmare was about getting called stupid. In highschool I got bullied and called stupid even tho I wasn't ironically which led to my ptsd. I dreamt I was in a classroom and everyone was ganging up on me again. My only response I could think of is ""im gonna kill myself"" so i ran out the classroom and I still got made fun of. I woke up angry and hot. Forgiving my parents is easy because I love them but I don't forgive people from highschool. Fuck them. They probably don't even remember yet it still affects me to this day.

"Medication and coping with anniversaries  21F, suffer with severe PTSD as a result of childhood and teenage experiences, as well as a >!sexual trauma I faced at 18.!<  

Sleep is my biggest issue, has been since I was 12 years old. Leaving the house just behind it. Nightmares come and go, as do flashbacks and can be chronic at times. I live in a very small area at the top of Scotland so bumping in to people who may trigger me is a huge possibility every time I leave the house and leads me to isolate myself quite a lot. I have recently started taking 150mg Pregabalin morning and night, which has helped slightly and I am due to increase that to 300mg x 2 soon. 

I would be keen to hear experiences from anyone else on PG should there be anyone here, I cannot and have never taken SSRI‚Äôs or SNRI‚Äôs due to previous manic episodes, diazepam does nothing for me and a month on propranolol made me feel worse. 

Since the event at 18 (almost 4 years ago) I have been a heavy alcohol and drug addict, I have been to rehab twice for 2 weeks and then 3.5 months respectively and am in therapy but having to live in a place where there is a bad memory or the potential to run in to someone who triggers me everywhere I go means neither of these have been very beneficial and getting a move has proved to be quite difficult also. I have defeated a trauma bond with one of my abusers but I still don‚Äôt know how my brain and body would react if I was to bump in to them. I am lucky to have a very strong support network around me but there is only so much they can do and I don‚Äôt think any amount of therapy will ever make me feel safe here but I am working hard on getting out of here and in the meantime hoping some medication will make things easier. I have felt slightly better in the last few weeks since taking PG and being clean and sober. 

I am desperate to get my life back and build a routine such as exercising daily and eating well, doing things I used to enjoy and just looking after myself properly before December, my birthday and Christmas come, as these are the hardest times of the year for me and should I manage that should be a protective factor and I would hopefully have a drive to keep going when things get tough. 

I‚Äôm not sure how much sense I have made here but any advice on both medication and coping is very much appreciated.

"My Husband and In Laws Don't Understand and it Hurts I ended up diagnosed with PTSD after my two dogs (German Shepherd and a Shepherd mix) got into a really bad fight. One was elderly and had mobility issues so he couldn't fight back and I was seeing him be ripped apart in front of me, the screams of agony were the worst part of it. I ended up being bit badly trying to break it up and needed stitches. My elderly dog got over 100 staples in his head and neck. 

The aggressor, my younger Shepherd was sent to a behavioural training center for a few months so we could figure out how to live safely with him. To be honest, I felt so incapable of handling this dogs issues that I wanted very badly to let his trainer adopt him. She was willing to and he was doing really well with her. My husband and his family fought hard against that and they won, the dog ended up coming home. Our older dog ended up going downhill healthwise and got put to sleep before our younger dog came home so I didn't have to worry about them getting into a fight but that only helped my fears inside the house, not outside. I made it clear to my husband that I was not capable of training this dog and that he needed to be able to do it without me. He agreed to that.

I don't trust our dog and I don't want to be around him when there are other dogs around. My panic attacks are unbearable and that level of discomfort doesn't go away unless I remove myself from it. I've tried exposure therapy but with my bad luck, I ended up witnessing 2 more dog fights and it made my anxiety worse so I stopped doing it. Nowadays is not as bad as it was in the first few months, as I dont have night terrors or startle reactions to inane, unrelated things. But a year later, I still can't face being around my dog with other dogs. It's still too hard.

My husband and his family pressure me constantly to bring our dog to his parents house when we stop in or attend holiday dinners. His parents have 2 large dogs. I told my husband very clearly, either I go or the dog goes, not both. My husband will still try to bring the dog with us and makes me feel stupid for saying I can't handle that. He will even sometimes ask me why as if I haven't cried while telling him how much I hate that I can't control how my mind and body reacts and how ashamed and embarrassed I am of it. I've told him I've felt suicidal over it, especially in the beginning. Every time we visit his parents without the dogs, his mom asks ""wheres the dog?"" and will talk about how much my brother in law misses him and wants to see him. I thought for a long time that she just didn't know why he doesn't come when I'm there. I found out today that she's well aware of my issues so it feels like shes poking at it on purpose. Which feels so cruel and hurtful. It's a small thing but it really hurts me.

It's so hard to explain to people who have never had to deal with this themselves that the worst part of all of this is the shame. They don't need to make me feel stupid cause I already do. They don't need to make me feel bad cause I'm already riddled with guilt. The lack of understanding makes me feel like I'm defective and alone. All I want is support and I'm made to feel ridiculous, like I need to just get over it already cause it's annoying. I've told my husband he should feel very lucky that he doesn't understand.

Is there anything I can do to help them understand or do I have to just be the bigger person and get a better handle on my feelings towards these ignorant remarks?",ptsd
"My husband who has CPTSD is mad at me. Without getting into a ton of details or potential triggers, my husband (at the title says) has CPTSD. He had a mental breakdown about 3.5-4 weeks ago and went to the hospital because I had to call 911. The police said they were chalking everything up to a mental health crisis and he wasn't being charged with anything and took him to hospital. He got on new meds, came home after about 6 days in hospital and things seemed better.

Then we got a letter in the mail about a court date because apparently he is being charged with something. I tried to get time off work but couldn't due to short notice to go to court with him and he got a public defender and plead not guilty at advice. They put into place a protection order (not against me, I'm allowed to see him/talk to him/etc.) though so he's not allowed within 1000 feet of our residence among other things and set a trial date for the end of the month. He was escorted to the house to grab a bag and then left.

I spent that entire afternoon and evening trying to figure things out so he didn't wind up just on the streets and with some help from family we managed to get him a hotel room for a week, so that was resolved. I immediately next day filed for the protection order to be terminated. That won't go to the judge till Thursday. 

We only have one vehicle so we've been doing this thing where I park the car when he needs to use it at my work, he comes and gets it later then leaves it back at my work so I can get it. But yesterday he accidentally left a bottle of his meds in the car. I told him I was going after work to play bingo with some friends and he asked me to drop it off when I was done at bingo. I said no problem, went on my merry way to go play bingo.

I didn't know, because I've never gone, that one game of bingo is actually like 15 games of bingo and takes like 3 hours. He texted me part way through and I guess the cell phone signal was blocked or something and I didn't get the text until I went outside to have a smoke after the game. He was upset that I hadn't gotten the meds to him fast enough and that I was still there. I apologized because I didn't know it was going to be so long either.

He called me and started yelling that I didn't ask him if he wanted to go to bingo with me, that I'm not thinking about him, that this might be the last time we can see each other and do anything together before he goes to prison. I told him that going to prison is not necessarily a set in stone thing that is going to happen and that he needs to try to stay positive because getting stuck in his head isn't helping anything.

We eventually got off the phone and I drove his meds to him at the hotel. He took the bottle and then told me ""you can go back to thinking about other things now"" and went back into the hotel before I could respond. I tried to call him and he sent me to voicemail. I sent him a text that said ""Really don't know what you think I've been thinking about but I probably haven't"" and he's left me on read since last night. 

This while thing has been a very stressful time for both of us and I'm trying to be as supportive as I can be. I apologized on the phone for not inviting him to go to bingo and explained that I thought he wouldn't want to go because he's very introverted and he wouldn't have known anyone else there but me and he'd already been up since 6am and had gone to play paintball and seemed tired when I saw him to get the car back. I should have asked him and I said that, but I can't change what happened.",ptsd
"I have some trauma from bullying So I was in the cross country team all throughout high school and my freshman and sophomore year i was going through a pretty emotional time because of hormones i guess. But anyways I would look really sad and emo and people would call me a school shooter because of that. 

The only good thing in my life at the point was I got good at running. After the end of the cross country season I was really trying to fit in so I was hanging out with my brother a lot trying to talk to his friends, which I really shouldn‚Äôt have done. I went to a party that was for seniors and everyone left me alone except for a guy on the team who made fun of me occasionally but it wasn‚Äôt bad until I interacted with him here, he was pretty much picking on me and at one point he starting pinching me and I just slapped his hand away. He was like ‚Äúoh ok ok, Corey hold my beer‚Äù and then he bodyslammed me. There was literally nothing I could do, I was much weaker than he was and I would‚Äôve just injured myself more. After that another point in the party I walked past him and then he shoved me and laughed. 

I had to leave after that. When summer practice started and I was talking to my friends getting all excited because I was excited for the season he was behind me with his click and was saying ‚Äúlook at this cringe kid, I actually through him on the ground at a party, it was easy.‚Äù And then he shoved me. I decided to shove him back but it was barely anything, because I was weaker than he was. 

Another point at another practice he was running behind me and then he started making fun of me some more making fun of my physique. 

There a lot more to this but this is the run up and the main things that make me angry every now and then. This was 5 years ago now and I still cannot get over it. From what I‚Äôve heard so far the guy failed out of college and now works in insurance. I get so uncomfortable when I think of this I can‚Äôt focus on other things. 

I never told a teacher or anyone superior about this because of the stigma of being a snitch or pussy. Looking back on it I feel like I should‚Äôve. It hurts me knowing I never got justice and so I look back constantly at how I could‚Äôve handled things differently. I‚Äôm now much stronger than I was (I can bench about 210) and often think about getting payback but obviously I can‚Äôt risk getting charged given I‚Äôm actually doing good in college now. ",ptsd
"My trauma was so intense that a girl from tinder blocked me A girl asked me what things happened that led me to get exposure therapy, and I was honest about it. I said goodnight and she said goodnight. A few days pass and I forget about the conversation, and ask her to hang out since I'm back in town. Then I find out she blocked when I checked after work. I was so confused until I scrolled up to the last convo and my trauma story which was like 1.5 paragraphs was the last message before the goodnight messages.

Honestly wtf? I literally did nothing but share a few traumatic experiences that was asked of me then I get blocked when I want to hang out a couple days after sharing them.

"New Job Down The Street From His House Guys, I'm really struggling. My work stuff got shuffled around, and long story short, I have a shift once a week one street over from the house of the teacher who (maybe???) was grooming me. I was 21 at the time, so it's not terrible, but everything about it still upsets me. We used to spend so much time at that house together.

When I took this job back in May, I just had office hours in the same town which was tolerable, but now I have extra hours at a different location right there. I have to drive past his street, and it sets me on edge and is so triggering. I have this pressing urge to just keep driving past his house until eventually we see each other just so I can see him, but I know how terrible that idea is. I talked to my supervisor and skipped last week, but I don't know if I can keep switching that shift and flexing hours constantly.

So, I‚Äôm a trans man, and about to get a hysterectomy. Legally in my state the only requirement to get one is to be 21 

However my insurance has informed my doctor that in order for them to approve of it they require a vaginal exam for a Pap smear, as well as an ultrasound. 

I‚Äôm so happy to be getting a hysterectomy soon, but dysphoria and ptsd has made the process a bit hellish.

"My trauma is ruining my life but I still have so many doubts Hey all, general TW for mentions of gun violence

I witnessed a shooting last year, and I'm starting to think I may have developed PTSD. My best friend and my partner both feel that I might have, at the very least that the shooting has deeply affected me. I'm starting to see where they're coming from, but I just can't bring myself to accept that the shooting could have affected me like that. 

My biggest thing is that I saw it, and it happened maybe 10 feet away from me, but I didn't get hurt. I can't accept being so shaken up when I'm not even the one that got hurt, I was lucky enough to get away and call 911. 

I know my parents put a lot of doubt and minimization in me when it happened. They're very manipulative, abusive, and their favorite thing to do is to downplay the severity of any bad situation. I know good and well that they're like this and always have been, but their judgements still ring true in my head. I was still living with them at the time, and I came home super rattled, it took me a good 20 minutes to spit out what happened to them. My mom told me how sneaky and secretive I was for not immediately telling them about it (as is her way), then my parents went on to tell me that I should've expected it going to that shady bar at that time of night, that I'm just lucky that I got away without being hurt, that I don't need to be so rattled because it wasn't me who got beaten and shot. 

And I know that isn't exactly healthy or realistic judgement and behavior from them, but I think it set into place my doubt. I thought I was fine at first except for my reaction to noises. For the first few months since it happened (and still to this day), loud and sudden noises startled me a lot. I worked in a kitchen, and I vividly remember one day someone dropped several metal sheet pans and I jumped so high and felt the sound through my entire being. I just had to continue on with work as normal. I eventually quit because I couldn't handle the stress of the kitchen, it wreaked havoc on my anxiety (amongst other things). 

Now, I feel borderline agoraphobic. I always think someone in public is going to snap out, so I rarely leave our house. I always think I hear people in our yard yelling, about to break into our house. I even get it in my head that my partner and his family are angry with me and will start an argument with me or worse.

I'm so tired. I just can't deal with this anymore. I can't live with constant fear that seeps deep into every fiber of my being anymore. I'm just so tired, and broken, and sometimes I feel like I'm about to break.

"Traumatic breakup, only me to blame‚Ä¶ So I (20F) dated my ex (22M) on and off for around two years and three months ago was when it finally had ended. Looking back now I see that he never really loved me and am having to deal with all the things I let slide, he didn‚Äôt want make it official for the first 6 months because what he told me after ‚ÄúI thought I could find better‚Äù. He was unemployed for two years, mom did everything for him, told me he would ‚Äúruin me psychologically for other guys‚Äù, broke up with me and slept with someone else then came back said he love me and it was a mistake (and I let himüòñ) & wouldn‚Äôt always follow consent etc. After we broke up we were still seeing each other but he didn‚Äôt want to make it official again, but got mad if I saw other guys.

The final straw was him drunk driving and crashing a rental car abroad where we both nearly died. After, because I put down my card for the rental car (he paid the same for the hotel so it was 50/50) 5800$ came out of my account and I was forced into overdraft, mentioning this was also my late mum‚Äôs pension money. He said he would pay me back but his parents only sent half.

A couple weeks later he randomly called me said he wanted to be the ‚Äúsingle bachelor‚Äù life and we haven‚Äôt seen each other in person since. I asked for my money back but he said I should pay for his crash as it was my idea to go abroad then was ghosted for a month & blocked, until last week he called me and told me he really loved me and I was the one to ghost him? And that he‚Äôd moved to the other side of the world with his family a week after we split. I said I didn‚Äôt care and just wanted my money back (as I‚Äôm struggling financially right not) but he ghosted me again. Just to add his family is very rich.

Looking back at all this I only have myself to blame because why did I stay? Why did I let myself get treated like utter trash & put him on a pedestal? How can I trust anyone again if someone I was that close to & with almost everyday could treat me like that? Dating guys now would just feel like an insult to myself.

"ONGOING Brutal PTSD Persecution I can not believe the disgusting situation I am in with my employer. A woman severely criticized my work, in front of others. I reported it and the employer claims it was a joke. I see it as defamation, which is not excused by 'joke'.

Since requesting accommodation, they trapped me in a room, where I informed them I was having a ptsd attack, they coerced me to sign a letter. This cut my pay so I only had $10 left in my bank for a week.

That is illegal coercion.  The letter drastically changed my employment against my will. That is not legal either.

Then they put me on 3 day unpaid leave and I must get a doctor note to return to work, which will take longer than 3 days to obtain.

"On the fence about whether I should tell a family member about the crimes of another family member (trigger warning SA) Hello friends in healing!  I'm  about to visit a cousin I haven't seen in 7 years this week. About 2 years ago I found out another cousin on the same side of the family is a pedophile. It's despicable  revolting, and heartbreaking what he has done. He barely served any time in prison because the victim wouldn't testify. He's supposedly a Christian man now, and his mother lives with him because his wife left him. His mom is sort of watching him, but she may have been led to believe his crime wasn't as severe as it was. Everyone in my immediate family knows. His (pedo) little sister knows and won't talk to him ever again. She just totally cut ties. 

The hard part is there are several people in my family who have been victim to child molesters, including myself, my brother, and my mother, and a few others. I heard a rumor when I was kid that this cousin I'm about to visit also was a victim to a neighborhood creep. My opinions in the past were like there's no use for pedos in society. They should have to do slave labour, or sent to  Chinese prison camp where they do much worse. Now, it's complicated. 

My brother was so shocked and hurt by this very close relative doing the exact thing that has hurt my brother and changed his life in sad ways, BUT he said he ""doesn't want the guy to kill himself. He's basically like my brother.""

Anyway, I guess I'll call my brother about it  and see his opinion. I just also wanted to hear people's opinions here. I know we've all been through some kind of hell. I'm sure this crowd understands mixed emotions.

my early childhood i don‚Äôt remember, but i left me selectively mute until age 16, until which i had not a single friend and no reason to develop as a person. my entire high school experience was in online school due this crippling mutism. i never had any teenage experiences. 

then one month into college i got bedridden from severe medical malpractice that left me crippled and left me with almost no skin left on my body, i looked like a raw chunk of meat for months. i was 19. 

my parents took away my only friend from me, my cat, and eventually killed him. my father also killed a kitten i wanted.

"feel like i'm out of treatment options Will preface that I am safe, i'm writing this from my bed at a crisis stabilization unit (similar to inpatient but voluntary and nothing is nailed down).

I don't want to die and I don't want to hurt myself, this shit just suuucks and i'm in unbearable pain all the time.

I've been through so many tragic and traumatic events I lose track of them. (Laundry list of dead friends, assaults, abusive authority figures, growing up trans in the south to my own detriment, got expelled from a christian school freshman year bc i got outed) Both my therapist and a friend of mine in his 60s have told me something to the effect of ""you've experienced more loss at 23 than most people do in a lifetime.""

In the last 2 months my symptoms have escalated considerably. My partner and I moved to a new house and within 24 hours of the last box coming through the door I started having these crying fits that last hours and hours and hours. This escalated for a bit so i started seeing my therapist 2x a week. Got an appt with a psych. She put me on some meds which I started this week. I've previously struck out with several other attempts at medication so we're down to the weird shit (memantine bc I have really bad OCD symptoms as well, the psych at CCS also gave me a script for luvox but it's not been filled yet)

2 weeks ago I took a leave of absence from work to go to PHP, in which we spent probably 40% of the time being shown TEDx talks and therapy in a nutshell on youtube (which i was miffed about but wtf ever, everyone's understaffed, i just want to heal) 

My symptoms have only escalated over the last few weeks. My usual regulation techniques (hot showers/stretching/distraction/sinewave breathing) are working less and less. Others that have been prescribed to me like mindfulness meditation and cold water on my face EFT tapping (FUCK that shit btw) tend to set me off instead of helping. I can't do the work to try and unpack my trauma anymore because so much as thinking about it sends me into a full-force spiral I can't get out of. 

I've been having ""total-recall"" flashbacks. Whereas usually flashbacks feel like i'm watching it on a movie screen, recently i'm having full cross-modal attacks where i can see/feel/hear/smell everything. Suddenly i'm right back in that scary place.

I have crying spells that last hours until I pass out, and that seem unavoidable no matter how much sinewave breathing or preventative measures I take. Recently my clonazepam PRN has stopped helping these episodes whereas previously it was my nuclear option.

Late this week I had an episode during PHP and my case manager recommended me to a crisis stabilization ward, where i am now. Most of the folks here are addicts or housing insecure so the groups are focused around that, which is fine, they need help too, it's simply not what I need. All i'm really getting rn is round the clock observation and a nurse making sure i take my meds.

I had the worst of these episodes today, I felt it coming on from a mile away, and had the nurse give me a full .5 tab of my klonopin preemptively (usually i take .25)

I sat by a window with a nice view, put on calming music, held myself while doing my sinewave breathing, and yet over the course of about an hour it just kept welling and welling until I started sobbing and i couldn't stop. 

I probably cried for another 90m before I was finally able to get the attention of the nurse, gave me another .5 of klonopin and hydroxyzine which KO'd me for a few hours. Now that i'm back awake i feel it welling up again so i took another .25 and am gonna try and go to bed early. Somewhere in there I started having uncontrollable tremors which is a ‚ú®brand new symptom‚ú® i've not experienced till today.

I've been in therapy for a decade, ever since i got expelled from christian school. I've done CBT, DBT, IFS/Parts, ACT, TIPP skills, I've spent a lot of time unpacking my shit, and for a while felt like I was actually making progress. I finished college, had a period of food/housing insecurity but landed a good job and just bought a condo with my life-partner. There was a shining minute back in like April when I could start to look at the trauma and be curious about it, and it didn't feel so big. I don't know why i've regressed so much so fast. 

It's been about a year now since the food insecurity stopped being a stressor, and trying to look at my life from an objective lense i'm the safest i've ever been. I have a loving partner, a house we own (thank you govt grant programs), and a relatively cushy job where I do fulfilling work. I have much much more than many of my friends can say.

Despite all this, i'm still in hell. I can't therapy skills my way out of these episodes no matter how hard I try. My hypervigilance is getting worse, my intrusive thoughts are getting worse, I'd been having these sobbing spells 2-3 times a week, since Thursday it's been daily.

The pain of everything that's happened is simply too much to bear. I really really really DON'T want to die. I want to grow old with my partner, I want things to get better, I want to believe that I'll overcome my trauma, but the pain is too much to bear and i'm rapidly exhausting my treatment options. 

I don't know where to go from here, I feel like my clinicians unilaterally don't know what to do with me, and i'm just scared and deeply hopeless about my treatment outcomes.

Has anyone else dealt with this sort of severity? Any tips on simply getting myself back on the horse? I'm on FMLA leave rn, but I need to go back to work soon so that I can keep my job, keep getting a paycheck, keep paying the bills and continue building my material/financial safety net so that I stop being so scared of slipping into food/housing insecurity again.

i want to keep going i just don't see any path forward. 

I feel like perfect-world i'd benefit from an inpatient residential with some kind of work-release to go to the office during the day (can't do my job remote unf). I think keeping myself busy has the potential to be helpful but I need round the clock support rn that I can't realistically ask of my partner or family. It doesn't seem like such a program exists though from what I can tell.",ptsd

"Prefrontal Cortex at 25- does this make trauma before worse? Hey guys,

Hope you can help me out. A friend was talking about how when you turn 25 or around the time your pre frontal cortex develops it can make trauma experienced and unprocessed a lot worse? Is this true? Like you can experience all the signs of ptsd but at that point they then can become unbearable?? and then you really start things like unhealthy attachments, choosing a familiar chaos over unfamiliar stability- maybe in relationships etc. Something about the disorder gettting a whole lot worse - maybe something to do with you now can see the past traumas were actually really fucked up but still have emotions from childhood? So like the adult part knows but that makes the child part feel horrific? Or maybe that extra brain spurt makes the amygdala grow?

I have experienced something similiar like around that time thats when things started becoming really really bad i dont know if coincidental but thats when drinking and drug use got really out of control, I broke up with a nice long term boyfriend and then went out with a narcissistic abuser

TW: Emetophobia, medical trauma

About 6 months ago I was at a convention I had this terrible episode where I couldn‚Äôt eat and threw everything up and had to go to the ER. I was sick for weeks, constantly nauseous and in pain. 

About a month ago, I was finally feeling up to go to a concert I really wanted to see. It was then that I realized that hotel bathroom was a trigger. The same bright lighting, the tile, the toilet.

It‚Äôs been almost 10 years since I graduated and also roughly 10 years since my abuse stopped. I tried to pursue higher education but struggled with that also.

Some of the reasons I left jobs weren‚Äôt due to stress or toxicity, it just so happened that I moved, wanted a better paying job, or covid happened and I got furloughed.

I'm fine with this being my life and being more comfortable at night time. It has its benefits. Less people to be annoying, no management at work, tends to be more relaxed and calm. I wouldn't be asleep if someone were to break in, etc. 

The issue I struggle with is being hyper aware of movements in my room. My boyfriend wakes up to go to the bathroom and im up. Comes back and im up. My cat gets in bed to sleep with me, I subconsciously can't move all night in fear of laying on him. He moves or stretches, I wake up. 

This is getting old. I work 12.5 hour shifts and I woke up at 1pm today due to my boyfriend using the bathroom and couldn't get back to sleep.

I have been falling asleep at work with my head on a table during slow times since I know my phones will wake me up easily. 

I take zoloft daily, Buspar twice a day, I have trazadone as well for sleep. I'm just tired of the hyperawareness. I don't want to wake up any time he gets out of bed. I want to be able to sleep for at least 6 to 7 hours straight. The waking up then sends me into panic attacks about not getting enough sleep before working long hours. 

Any tips?",ptsd
"Repressed csa memories or something else?? i‚Äôve been having back to back nightmares, usually about sexual situations in which i don‚Äôt want to be there or i‚Äôm myself as a child. i don‚Äôt remember any specific event that could‚Äôve happened but i have so many things that feel connected to it. i‚Äôm in treatment for ptsd and bpd so i don‚Äôt know if i feel this way because of other awful stuff from my childhood, but i‚Äôve always been both hypersexual and terrified of anything sexual, to the point of crying at even the suggestion. i remember having frequent uti‚Äôs as a child (like 3 or 4?) but obviously i didn‚Äôt know what that was, i just remember it burning when i peed, if that‚Äôs relevant. i started wetting the bed again at 8 and continued to for years, this is also when my stomachaches and horrible anxiety issues began. my dad was in jail/rehab most of my childhood and my mom was always working or partying, so i‚Äôd be watched by either my grandparents (grandpa is a püåΩ addict) or my uncle+aunt (always shared the bed with them when i stayed over). from the age of 7 or 8 i felt so ashamed any time i shared a bed with someone else, even my mom. this is also the same time i was always terrified that id become pregnant, despite being 8 and not even having a first period yet. since 11 i‚Äôve developed issues with any sort of physical contact, i get really uncomfortable from it. i just don‚Äôt understand why i experience sexual nightmares, aversion to physical touch, shame surrounding anything sexual (or feeling like some innocent things are sexual so therefore shameful), hypersexuality, and fear of men ??",ptsd

"Do People Just Not Get It? October is a busy month for me, and it just gets busier until November hits essentially (for like, a week and a half, honestly), and I am going through a lot right now.

My main stressor is my lack of sleep while on campus. I am in year 2 of 2 for my masters degree. Last March, a fire alarm went off at 2 am while I was asleep; when they go off when I'm asleep, my brain thinks it's a nightmare so I have these super shoer nightmares about burning in the building or something.....after which I open my eyes to the fire alarm actually going off and I gtf out of there. Unfortunately, I have not been able to sleep on campus since.

I thought I would be better after the summer, but no. I have tried explaining this to my parents, and their first reaction is to *consider pulling me out of school* before realizing that I can't really do that because of my scholarship. I love my parents; simultaneously, I don't feel that they take this seriously, they didn't teach me drive so I can't commute, and they are not willing to help pay for therapy. 

I honestly don't know what to do; I think this lack of sleep thing is starting to affect my life, including productivity, energy levels, and my health...I take my health very seriously and do not need this.

"I'm struggling so much and it makes me feel so crazy and stupid I have C-PTSD. I had a lot of trauma growing up and then a fresh load of new trauma over the past 7 years.

That's about all the information I'll give on that.. But essentially, I have 5 cats and they're basically my kids. They're my family. I haven't ever been away from them for more than 24 hours in their entire lives, and it's obviously been years. I'm very protective of them, we have our little routines, I keep them safe.. But I'm going abroad for the first time in my life for 2 weeks - and will be away from them for all of that time. My mother will be looking after them which I'm grateful for. But I'm still fucking terrified.. Of course of the simple prospect that I've got to be without them, but also cause what if something happens. A medical emergency. One of them goes missing. Cause they're indoor cats and one wrong move is from my family in that house is all it takes, and one of them could go out and get lost. It's fucking scaring me just typing about it.. It's also the idea that, look I know they're cats and they don't feel like we do. But they are still gonna miss me. And that breaks my heart.. I feel like some of the stuff I'm describing and feeling is all expected and normal for someone in my position, but it's obviously the PTSD aspect that makes those concerns not normal and my brain doesn't cope with it all correctly..

"Anyone Self harm? Is this PTSD and/or Complicated Grief? Anyone self harm in the past, if you want to share your story? Did you have PTSD also? Do you think PTSD can lead to self harm?

I¬†asked because I want to understand more about my husband's self harm, perhaps it also PTSD and Complicated Grief in his case.

Long story short, my husband's father died, while he was still grief his father death. In 2019 our child died of brain disease progression (genetic inherited it from me the mother side), it has nothing to do with my husband.

While my husband still grief our child death. In 2021 I had a near death experience, I was very sick, hospitalized, I almost die.

I basically saw my husband cries everyday. So so much tears from him, and emotional pain. Many times he not just cry, but completely bawl, so much to the point he had both hands on his head and bawl to the point collapse and curl up in a ball on the ground. His emotions is just INTENSE.  
Even in his deep sleep he bawl, I do not know why but tears just roll down his face and he bawl in his sleep.

When I was sick, many times he hugged me and said he very afraid (as in he very afraid that I will die). I don't know if it his father death, our child death, and my near death experience all build up together.

This was when he started to cut his stomach with a kitchen knife, he said stomach skin is thinner and has more nerves so it hurts more, and nobody see his stomach than if it was on his legs of arms, so he chose to cut his stomach, he cuts deep the point bleeding that he has bandage wrap around his waist bleed.  
And that was how I first time found out about he cut himself too was I saw the bloody bandage wrap around his waist when he took his shirt off.

His emotions is just so INTENSE, and his grief is just so intense it like he crave the physical pain to mask his grief.

He still has the scars on his stomach from he cut his stomach with the kitchen knife. He said if I die before him, he will die with me, because on the other side has his father, his child, has me, and we be a family again. His suicidal thoughts?

This man when I married him he has no scars on his body, after married to me now his stomach is full of scars, I feel bad that I blame it on myself that because genetics our child get brain disease from me the maternal side, that why our child died. And I blame it on myself for being sick, hence he on the verge of lose me too, so he stared cutting himself.

I guess a bit on the brighter side, eversince I recovered and healthy now, he hasn't cut himself since, he said he will continue live for me, I am the reason why he still living. This is why I am taking care of my health. I will make sure I won't die before him, because like he said, his exact words: ""the one surviving, will be the most painful.""",ptsd
"therapist wont work on trauma with me outpatient? i have been with this therapist for about 6 years. i went to her bc she is a trauma specialist that is covered by my state insurance/medicaid and i do like her a lot. we have dipped our toes into my trauma history and have done ""practice memories"" for emdr and have tried to do one whole narrative of a memory i consider to be less severe but still overwhelming. i have been diagnosed with a complex dissociative disorder and have had dissociative episodes when we have tried to do these methods of treatment. now, she says that i should only approach these in an inpatient setting, and just wants to do basic everyday catch ups and stabilization 

i cannot afford to go to a trauma and dissociation hospital (there is one somewhat near me, but bc i have state insurance and that facility is out of state, i cannot go) and also cannot stand having no active treatment for this. i know at this point the best method for actual long-term improvement is exposure and working with these memories, but i dont know what to do or how to stabilize to the point of being able to safely navigate these memories and dissociation, especially while still being able to work and help support my partner financially and emotionally

"12yr. Classmates tried to murder me. My father kidnapped my brother and me when I was 11. Told us courts gave him custody. Told us she did not want us. Took us from Montreal to Alberta. Wetaskiwin I think. First day of school I got invited for lunch at classmate's house. Thought they would be friends. When I got to there, one fired a shotgun. It missed me and blew a hole through the door. I ran and was chased like a slave. We'll kill you, Frenchy. (I'm not French) I feel the fear in my chest just typing this. No one can see unless they wire me up. I was put in a room. Police showed up. I remember feeling disliked, not safe.

My father came. I hear the cop still. It was just a prank. You don't like it, leave. We fled that day. Abandoned my dog. To this minute, too many stressors make me get all tense. Eventually I shout and rush away.

Work considers this aggression and I had hours cut back 30%. This worsened my life. $59 to live on for 2 weeks. Yet supposed to work from 11-5pm and be productive. Since the ptsd triggers became constant I could not be a programmer so they put me on unpaid medical leave.

"My subconscious mind refuses to believe that the violence and assault on us has ended and that we live in peace now. I am really tired because I wasted 10 years of my life with the hypervigilance caused by the assaults that happened to me and the violence.

I just want to experience the feeling of living in peace and tranquility because I miss these moments. But I still believe that I will succeed one day. 

What if there really is a way for me to convince my subconscious that the danger is over? But what is the way and how can I find it?

"My Journey to Health and my Silent Battle with PTSD Life has a way of presenting us with moments that define who we become. For me, that moment came through the eyes of my daughter. This isn't just my story of weight loss; it's about rediscovering myself through the love of my family. I remember the day clearly. My daughter, with the innocent yet piercing eyes of a child, asked if I could run to the park with her. The truth was, I couldn't. At my heaviest, the physical strain was too much. That moment was a wake-up call, not just for my health, but for the kind of father I wanted to be. I saw my reflection not in a mirror, but in her hopeful gaze, and it was then I knew I had to change.¬†The journey was daunting. Weighed down by years of unhealthy habits and a sedentary lifestyle, I embarked on a mission not just to lose weight, but to gain life. Each step, each meal choice, became a step towards being the dad my daughter deserved. 



The support from my wife was invaluable; we made this a family effort, transforming our diet and activities. It wasn't just about numbers on a scale. It was about feeling the joy of chasing my daughter in the park, of being able to lift her up without gasping for breath. I began to see food as fuel, exercise as joy, and my daughter's laughter as the best reward. Losing weight is often portrayed as a physical challenge, but for me, it was deeply emotional.¬†There were days of doubt, of feeling like this mountain was too high to climb. Yet, looking at my daughter, seeing her pride in my efforts, gave me the strength to continue. This journey taught me about resilience, about the power of love as motivation, and the importance of mental health in physical transformation. 



Today, when I look back, I don't just see the pounds lost; I see the life gained. My daughter's dream of having an active, healthy dad became my reality. This journey has been about so much more than weight loss; it's about the bond I've strengthened with my family, the example I've set, and the joy of being fully present in my daughter's life. To anyone starting their journey, know this: change begins with a single step, often inspired by the simplest, most profound love‚Äîthe love for your family.¬†My story is a testament to that. Every run, every meal, every laugh with my daughter, is a reminder of why I started and why it's all worth it. My story began in a place of trauma, when I was stabbed multiple times by three young men at the age of 17. It was a defining moment that altered the course of my life. This event that triggered my PTSD was like a stone thrown into a still pond, with ripples that extended far beyond that initial impact. Alcohol became my refuge, a temporary escape from the haunting memories and the relentless anxiety.



¬†Over the years, what started as an escape turned into a prison, with walls built from denial, shame, and solitude. Living with PTSD and substance abuse is like fighting a war on two fronts. Each day was a battle against the invisible scars of trauma and the visible effects of addiction. The hardest part? Realizing that I needed help. Admitting weakness in a world that values strength was daunting. But, as they say, the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem. For me, that step was acknowledging the havoc I was wreaking not just on my life, but on those around me. 



Today, I stand on the other side of what felt like an insurmountable divide. My life is not perfect, but it's mine, fully lived, not shadowed by the ghosts of addiction and trauma. I share this story not for sympathy, but in solidarity with anyone in their own battle.¬†You are not alone. There is a way out, and it starts with a single, courageous step towards change. Overcoming a 29-year battle with alcohol and PTSD has taught me that while we can't change the past, we can heal from its wounds. My journey reminds me daily of the strength hidden within us, the capacity to love, forgive, and most importantly, to heal. To anyone currently in their own struggle, remember: recovery is not just possible; it's waiting for you on the other side of your next step towards healing.

**In the Heart of the Forest:**  
In a cozy forest glade, a fox named Felix lives in the shadow of his fears. Ever since he was a kit, coyotes have filled him with dread, and no one seems to understand his quiet sadness. But with the help of a wise old owl and an unexpected encounter with a coyote, Felix learns that being brave doesn‚Äôt mean never being afraid‚Äîit means finding the courage to face his fears. Join Felix as he embarks on a heartwarming adventure filled with friendship, hope, and the discovery of his own brave heart. This touching and uplifting book is inspired by the author's personal battle with PTSD. This book is based on my battle with PTSD, through the eyes of Felix the Fox. My hope is to get this book to anyone struggling with their mental health to be able to relate to their kids what it's like to fight silent battles.

"Being a defamation victim (I wasnt sure which flair to put, if I should have put another one I apologize)

Two years ago my ex falsely accused me of
raping her, no proof, no real arguments, lies who barely make sense. And yet many of my former friends believed her, refused to hear my side of the story, only 3 did and those 3 all realized I was innocent. I should have known this girl was not a good person, but love blinded me from the red flags. She was a person with a victim mentality inventing stories protraying her as a victim to get people attention, she even accused her brother of raping her which was also a lie. My social life was destroyed, my trust in others shattered and I was terrified of going outside, thankfully my familly believed me, after a year I got better slowly. And then one year later, she went to the police and filled a  complain against me, trying to destroy my life so her lie would have more credibility. I was interrogate and due to procedures I was held in custody for a few hours. Thankfully the police did not believed her and deemed me innocent and so they let me go, dropping the case, from the start I could see the interrogator did not believed her. It shows how her lie is flawed and yet so many belived her, I dont think she ever told her parents because we never ever heard from them, they didnt even accompagned her when she filled her complain (I know from the complain files my lawyer my father got showed it to me, its allowed in France). My custody led me to develop claustrophobia, I ended up moving away from the city I lived in because I was scared of seeing her or any of my former friends, who by the way threatnen to beat the shit out of me if they saw me ever again. 

One year later, this jully, I developped PTSD, over the next months I had flashbacks, I could see their faces, heir voices, her their accusation, I have nightamres of the event, sleeping became unrestfull, sometimes I feel like she is always around watching me, I'm terrified of going to specific places alone or at all. I even had an hallucination where my appartement turned into the holding cell I was put in. Since then, the subjects of rape, defamation can trigger me. Sex repulse me and scares me, because I consider sex as something very intimate I only want to so with someone I trust deeply. And the only had it with was her, it shattered me on that part. Even her name can trigger me and provoke an episode. 

Now, I havent made any new friends, I was shy before with difficulty to socialize but since then it has been a lot worst, everytime I get close to some, I can get scared and it triggers flashes and I cant bring myself to get closer. 

I have been broken since then, I can hardly trust people, I feel like she is still tormenting me, I can have an episode at any moment. Physical contact became something I dread except with specific people, the subjects of rape and defamation can trigger, sometimes the words alone are enough to cause an episode, I developped claustrophobia and sex repulse me. I want to heal and I try to heal, but its a long slow process, I know it wont ever trully go away but I want to be able to live with it and move on from it.

Thank you for reading, I cant confess or vent to many people so I needeed somewhere to let it all out. Despite being scared of strangers its somehow either to talk about it online on a subreddit like this, humans sure are strange.

"Facing my greatest fear I have done my best to summarize what is a long story. Please bear with me, I guess I am looking for advice or support. 

I have one daughter who is the centre of my world. I love her more than anything.  

In the time that I could have gotten pregnant, I was in a relationship with the man of my dreams (or so I thought) but I was SA'ed by someone else.
 
I told my partner and after long discussions, we decided to continue with the pregnancy. In all honesty, I wanted an abortion but was convinced otherwise and I don't regret it. We agreed there would be no DNA test as I didn't want to know if she had come from that. He signed the birth certificate.

He was arrested a couple weeks after her birth for very serious crimes for which he was eventually convicted for and sent to prison. It was a massive shock to me and I really struggled with it all. Anyway, I went back to school and got a good job. My daughter is thriving and I love being a mom. They have had no relationship for years as a result of the criminal court orders. 

He got out of jail recently and there has been negotiations surrounding me having the right to travel internationally with my daughter. This is basically the only right I do not have. 

I don't want child support and he is not allowed near children so there is no visitation. He is now challenging paternity and wants a DNA test. I am advised that the court will likely order this and I will have to comply. 

It feels like the biggest kick to the guts. I just don't want to know if she is my rapists. Maybe that is living in denial but I don't want that to effect our relationship. I still have PTSD from it all and I just want to believe it isn't true. I want to forgot. 

It also seems really unfair, he cannot have access to her and I am not seeking support. I wish the court would just let him take himself of the birth certificate. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this? 

Thank you. ",ptsd
"21M struggling to socialize and feel like I am going down a path I can't come back form Some important things to note I was diagnosed by a doctor, was on treatment for a while but had to quit everything cause of financial trouble I was not weened off my meds I just stopped taking them after I ran out ik it's stupid but I didn't have any other options. PLus I am an SH addict but haven been clean for almost 7 months but I feel like thats about to go down the drain too.  
  
I‚Äôm a 21M from a South Asian country, and I‚Äôm struggling with the consequences of (CSA). Growing up, I distanced myself from my peers and mostly interacted with my family, keeping that to a minimum. To avoid worrying my family, I faked a social life‚Äîpretending everything was fine when it really wasn‚Äôt.

Support in my culture is hard to come by, and I‚Äôve never felt comfortable discussing my experiences with anyone. I‚Äôve been in university for three years now, hoping to socialize and make connections, but it hasn‚Äôt gone well. I‚Äôve made some poor decisions and trusted the wrong people with secrets that I shouldn‚Äôt have shared.

One of the biggest challenges I face is my fear of socializing with men because of my past. Most girls in my department tend to think I am a ""pickme"" because of my lack of male friends plus I think there is a lot of gossip regarding me and I feel like people maintain a distance from me. It makes it hard to socialize, and it often feels like the harder I try to connect, the further I drive people away.

I do have one guy friend in my department whom I trust to some extent, but that relationship developed out of necessity as I couldn‚Äôt navigate my computer science degree alone. I also have a friend from another department, but our relationship feels superficial. I find myself putting in most of the effort to keep it alive, reaching out and planning things, while she has her own struggles stemming from a similar childhood.

I am looking for advice on how to tackle this and be better. Also while I was seeing doctors they told me i was at risk for Anhedonia and I feel like I have developed it or gotten it or whatever because now I just rot in my bed or on the couch staring at walls or the ceilings. I have quit on the limited hobbies I had because it feels like I don't have the energy for them and it all just seems boring.",ptsd
"DAE with childhood trauma get lowkey triggered by kids / teens who are the age you were when it happened? OK so I went for a walk today, which is already a good achievement in itself, since I still live where I was for the majority of the 9 years of Initial Trauma & the 4(?) years of Follow Up Trauma, and going out is hard because no matter where I go, anywhere within walking distance involves either: locations I was traumatised in, locations I heavily associate with the trauma, or routes which lead to / go past those locations. So going out for a walk (for an hour!) is a good thing.


But while I was out, I saw 2 kids on bikes passing by (they were maybe 6) further up ahead who were walking their dog (they looked maybe 8-10), 2 kids out on a run / jog together (they looked 11 - 14), 2 kids passing by with their football (they looked 8-10) and 2 kids decorating their garden for Halloween (they were maybe 4). Other than the last 2, each time I saw the kids it was mildly triggering, and I kept expecting to see someone I knew / run into someone I knew as a child. But I also felt the anxiety / dread creeping up each time, because it used to be that if I saw a kid in that area, it was someone I knew due to the fact we were in the Trauma Location together & they were either also bring traumatised or they were in the same location but weren't developing Trauma/ weren't being abused there like I was. 

So even though I'm 25, even though I know for a fact I don't know anyone in those areas anymore, even though those kids have nothing to do with my Trauma... I still felt it creeping up on me.

"Therapist validated previous PTSD diagnosis  I was diagnosed with PTSD several years ago and my previous therapists wouldn‚Äôt touch the subject.

I was expecting my current therapist to say I was misdiagnosed, but he said ‚ÄúI do think you show many signs of PTSD.

He gave me a selection of reasons why but after talking about it for hours over the past two days , it has become really clear it is basically entirely because of my mental illness .  I even went as far as to ask ""If I was mentally well , would you still be breaking up with me ."" and he said no . I already feel like such a burden because of my illnesses but this has just completely knocked any sense of self-worth I had and I feel so stupid for letting him into that part of my life and telling him my feelings . 

I have severe OCD which came about four or five years ago after a really awful , abusive few years . I have been doing way better with that , though and he never told me that the OCD was the problem , despite it being the most obvious and prevalent issue I have . He told me I have ""deep-seated trauma and PTSD that needs addressing"" and that I try so hard to ignore and conceal it but he can see how much it affects me. 

This is all so shocking to me because I have been living in a state of turmoil for years and it just feels really normal to me now . It was not until I asked him to actually tell me clearly what I do that frightens him and stresses him out that I actually realised that he is right to tell me these things are not normal . He listed: I shake for hours every night and bite my teeth down over and over while I sleep , I wake up at night panting and feeling sick , I cry and shake and feel disconnected from the room whenever I have sex , I ""can't be in a room of people without feeling like a black spot on the conversation"" . There was more but that was what stuck with me . 

I don't know what to do about this . I want to get better because this is not the first time I have been told I am too mental to be around . Partners , friends , family and even therapists have all told me at some point that they need to step out of my life directly because of the severity of my emotions. I don't want people to keep leaving me because of these things I can't help . I have been in therapy for years but it somehow is still not enough . But it has mainly been OCD-based therapy , not trauma therapy . I don't even feel like what happened to me is bad enough to cause this much damage . 

Where am I even supposed to go from here ? I feel so lost and beaten down . Not just because I lost my boyfriend , who I absolutely adored , but because those years of abuse continue to take and take and I can't do anything but observe it corroding my life , so out of my control . 

Please tell me what I am supposed to do . ",ptsd
"feeling lost in a new relationship a little bit about me: I have PTSD from multiple SA and a romantic relationship with a borderline person. I am in therapy. F21. 

I started a new relationship recently. He has been my good friend for the past 3 years, lately we started hanging out and the spark appeared. We had so much chemistry in the dating stage, I was extremely happy. Then, suddenly I felt really anxious and I started thinking that he might be wrong for me for some reason and idk what to do. He is a really cool guy, has all the important qualities I need, but I find myself obsessing and panicking over pretty much anything. I was super attracted to him, we had so much s*x - now I feel it too but everything is ‚Äúblurred‚Äù, I can‚Äôt feel 100% fine when I am with him. It started when I started therapy and I talked about my trauma, that‚Äôs why I am posting on this sub. I don‚Äôt even know what I wanna hear tbh. I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I feel anxious, down and distant - just as I have felt in my toxic relationship 3 years ago. Is it PTSD and anxiety acting up, self sabotage or am i really just not into him anymore? That would be so weird tho - I feel like if my feelings ended it wouldn‚Äôt be so rapid and out of the blue, it would kinda creep up on me slowly. This feels sudden, dark and terrifying, like I was in a toxic relationship. But i‚Äôm not. But what if i am? ",ptsd

"How do you ground yourselves? \[TW: Suicide\] My (27F) PTSD is related to traumatic mourning. I've seen things related to his passing that pop up daily, becoming triggered can result in a complete shutdown where I sit quietly whilst the world continues on, or I have to excuse myself and completely breakdown in tears somewhere alone.  
The things that can trigger me are alot, and sometimes seemingly unrelated. A scratched floor, a messy room, a talking subject related to sadness (and then having thought of: Why can't I be sad about something simple anymore?), a song. My brain is in the works of creating more and more triggers, which I am getting IE therapy for. 

My question is: Do you have any grounding techniques you find that help you when you are stuck in a social situation?   
I have a wedding next week and will be one of the maids of honour. Though I am super happy for my friend, I don't look forward to it. I do worst in situations with new people that don't know, it feels like I have to put on a huge mask to get through the day and the things that trigger me get worse during such moments. I know I will get triggered, I am in a group of strangers except the bride and I do NOT want to go to her for help. (We met when we were 12 on the internet and live quite the distance apart, hence why I don't know anyone else).

Thanks a ton in advance.

TLDR: I have a social event coming up and I know I will get triggered and sad during the day. Do you guys have grounding tips? ",ptsd
"I was abused at a very young age for a very long time. Now, in my current relationship, I have no libido and no clue how to tell my partner. **TW: Basically anything to do with sexual assault, or abusive/neglectful parents, incest, etc...**

To preface this, I have already been diagnosed with PTSD, Clinical Depression + Anxiety, and ADHD. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, I just wanted to share my story, as I've never got the chance to in detail. Apologies if it's a long read. Also, a LOT of my childhood is suppressed, so the middle gets murky for me.

  
A big overview, or TLDR; I am AFAB, but I am a Trans FTM, so I go by He/Him pronouns, and from the ages of 2-13 I was molested, raped, and abused by my brothers and one other man. Now, I am 20, and I feel bad for my boyfriend,, because I cannot bring myself to desire sex. 

In more detail, I am the youngest of all of my siblings, and I was the only girl. I have two full siblings, and one half sibling that my dad had during a break with my mom. This didn't cause my mom to divorce him though, and by the time my half brother was 7, he came to live with my family. That's when my abuse started. Now, I was 2, so I don't remember the specifics. My mom always told me that I was most likely abused as soon as he came to live with us, as my potty training suddenly went away and I was wetting the bed from then until I was about 14/15 years old. 

I believe if I got into the specifics, it would be kind of redundant, so I'll specify just the basics. My oldest and half brother(HB) was the main and most consistent abuser. He went on to teach my 3rd brother(3B) how to abuse me, which ended up in 3B raping and molesting me repeatedly while I was in middle school. HB was also still consistently molesting me as well. My 2nd brother(2B) was the only one that never touched me inappropriately, but I do believe he knew of the abuse. That was my consistent life for most of my childhood, until one of my Dad's friends got drunk and molested me while I tried to sleep at one of their parties. It was the first time a stranger took advantage of me and despite everything, it was very different from my brothers, who I thought loved me. This led me to outing everything during a Christian camp, which I foolishly thought wouldn't get reported. When I was 13, HB was arrested and sent to Juvie. 3B continued to abuse me until I told my mom about it during the same year. My mom didn't get him arrested or separate us, she just told him to stop, and to be fair, it did stop. 

I however, was not the same. I grew to expect the abuse, my mind was twisting it to make me think I was waiting because I wanted it to happen, but in hindsight, I know that's just because I was so used to it. I became extremely hypersexual, from the ages of 12-17 I would say. I was engaging in ERP with older people online, obsessively reading sexual comics, fanfics, etc. I craved a relationship, but my dad was incredibly abusive, and besides school- I wasn't allowed out of the house, so friends were few and far between.

Fast forward to 2019, my mom divorced my dad, and we were finally free. My mom wasn't a saint, but I'm glad she did that. I was around 15/16. We moved, I made real friends and we were good all throughout my high school years. I got my first real boyfriend(and current boyfriend) after I graduated in 2022. Now to what the other half of this post is about, haha.

I was very sexual when we first got together, but something, I'm not sure when, just stopped clicking. I love my boyfriend, I'll call him T from now on. T has never pressured me into sex, he doesn't expect it from me, he doesn't shame me, and he knows my past traumas. But I am not stupid. This change in me is hard on him, I can tell. He has the normal libido of a 20 yr old. On the other hand, I have no desire whatsoever, and not just towards him. Comics, fanfics, yada yada, etc.... All of that stuff is like reading an epitome lol.

I am still attracted to T and I love and cherish him with literally every fiber of my being, but WTF!!!!! I literally don't know what to do, I don't know how to fix it, because it's not a conscious thing?? I don't know if I'm alone in this feeling, and I don't know if anyone else has found the cure.

I'm lost in a cloud of ""I don't know"", and I don't want T to start thinking it has something to do with him.

Help!!! :'(",ptsd
"Why do I feel incredibly anxious about going to work?  Hey guys, this is something I didn't start to experience until about 2-3 years ago but I'm stumped and so defeated. My trauma was entirely unrelated to work and I've only been able to hold most jobs for a month or 2 before it hits me.

"idk what to do so my boyfriend got super drunk at new year and got pancreatitis, was hospitalized for a few weeks. i was in a really bad way at the time with my mental health and already in hospital myself. i suffer from anorexia, anxiety and seasonal depression so am often in hospital that time of year. anyway. i was convinced he was going to die and he was my only reason for living so it was pretty much the worst time of my life. i was put on 1:1 supervision with nurses and tube fed because i was just completely incapable of keeping myself safe and would try end it at every opportunity.

skip forward to now, he‚Äôs completely recovered but can‚Äôt drink though has discovered he can smoke weed. i‚Äôm doing better with my own stuff but have developed ptsd from the trauma from the beginning of this year. i‚Äôm currently staying with family in california (we‚Äôre from england) to try and help my seasonal depression and, for the most part, it‚Äôs working. apart from when my boyfriend smokes. midnight is 4pm here so even though he doesn‚Äôt smoke till late there‚Äôs no way of me sleeping through it like i did back home- i‚Äôm always awake when he does it. and knowing he‚Äôs high just brings back all the emotions of when he was so drunk he couldn‚Äôt communicate and then again when he was super medicated in the hospital. i spiral every time, my anxiety goes crazy and i can‚Äôt even call my mum for support because she‚Äôs asleep. i genuinely feel so helpless and don‚Äôt know what to do or how to cope with the flashbacks and experiencing anxiety like this. i know no one with ptsd in real life to get advice from so i thought id try asking online. i know he‚Äôll be smoking tomorrow and just can‚Äôt deal with facing these emotions anymore.

for a while, i thought it was getting better, but ive realized it was because i was relapsing with my anorexia and was using that as a distraction from everything. i‚Äôm back on track now and really don‚Äôt want a relapse to be the only coping strategy. any help would be really appreciated ",ptsd

I probably wouldn‚Äôt have sold myself if I wasn‚Äôt raped so much over the years. But I knew it didn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôll still be raped and treated badly no matter what. 

Sometimes friends ask about my sex life and stuff and I feel so insecure. Like I feel a lot more experienced than them. I mean obviously I am but I just feel like an old woman.

"I feel like I‚Äôve been misdiagnosed So I just started going back to therapy to see about why I‚Äôm unable to focus or pay attention at all when people are talking to me, which has been a reoccurring issue since childhood. After evaluation and assessments, my therapist diagnosed me as having generalized anxiety disorder with post traumatic stress disorder. 

See, the thing is, from what I always heard about ptsd is that people who have it will avoid anything having to do with their trauma relating to their ptsd or sometimes have flashbacks of said trauma. 

I was living with a single mom (no siblings, grandparents lived in another town) for all of my childhood and she would constantly have these emotional outbursts of rage when she got overstimulated or overwhelmed. I love my mom and she never hit me or anything, but I don‚Äôt think she was in the right place mentally when she had me. Anytime I would make a mistake, she would yell and scream and question why I did it, instead of just understanding I‚Äôm a child and make mistakes (also I was such a self isolating child and didn‚Äôt have a friend until the 2nd grade). Or just in general, anytime anything was wrong, I would always hear the loudest volume her voice could go. I also felt like she would never take me seriously when I tried to express myself in any way, whether it‚Äôs relating to sadness or not. Even today, when I bring it to her attention how I felt as a child, it‚Äôs ‚Äúwell, I guess I‚Äôm just the worst mother in the world, then‚Äù. 

My issue is this: I feel like I‚Äôm becoming my mother. I lived most of my life with just this one personality, it‚Äôs taken me years to understand how other people live and what others don‚Äôt take as seriously compared to my mother. But now anytime I get angry, I find myself throwing outbursts as well, then feeling so down about myself because I know this isn‚Äôt who I want to be. I feel like it‚Äôs a response I‚Äôm so used to because it was so normal in my house to react so dramatically everytime an event happened.

I feel like I‚Äôm not avoiding the trauma, but subconsciously reliving it in my daily life. Can PTSD trauma also come from not a single event, but a collection of triggers and emotional responses from your environment when you were a kid?  Maybe it‚Äôs genetic. ",ptsd

"It's a long story but here I go Hello, my name is E ( Female 28yo native french). I'm not sure where to start to be honest, there's a lot to uncover, it's going to be a very long post so brace yourselves those who will read this.

I was born in Paris but lived in a very very small village in the countryside maybe 2hs away from paris until I was 10yo, I have a twin brother born on the same day just minutes apart from me. My dad had us when he was around 20 and my mom around 30.

My mom left my dad when we were reaching 6yo (just 1 or 2 months before our birthday) because my dad would threaten to kill and bury her in the garden, she seeked advice from a psychiatrist who told her he would kill her if she didn't leave, but not to worry about us, we weren't his target, so she left. We saw her every weekends and every wednesday (no school on wednesday for elementary students)

I don't recall anything from this period apart from my father going out with another woman (N) who had a child around 3 years younger than us. The child A was subjected to violence like us. My mom told us about how the mom would hit me and my brother where it didn't show, stomach, back, thighs, butt. I saw a picture of a long and large bruise on one of our thigh (think it was my brother) my mom took as evidence to show to the police.

The only thing I remember from her is how she kept screaming with my dad about how they would throw A from the window if she didn't stop crying (from my room on the 1rst floor). The mom eventually broke her daughter's wrists (yes, both wrists) and was placed under surveillance and lost custody of A. My dad was also under surveillance and my mom told me he calmed down for a while because of it. They eventually broke up not long after.

When we were around 7-8 my dad found another girlfriend (Na) who liked me but not my brother. She had a son with my dad so it's my half brother (JD). Again I don't recall much from her apart from her shutting off my brother from interacting with me when she was here. I didn't have the best relationship with my brother so I didn't really care about him being left out because of her, I just wanted to play with my toys in peace. 

One fateful day, when JD was a few months old, I was taking care of him because his mom wasn't home (and I was the only girl in the house, despite being 7-8) while my dad was showering. My brother started crying for god knows what reason, my dad because very mad because of the noise and started yelling from the shower about how he'll kill him if he didn't shut up, he kept screaming so I feared for his life. Later in the day when the mom came back, I told her about the threats and she took immediate action.

The next day she brought me in the car with her and her dad, kept me in the car while she went to the police station, stayed there for a long time. That's the extent of my memory from her. She left with all her belongings when my dad wasn't home with JD. My dad knew it was me who snitched on him, I have no idea what happened to me after that.

Now this part will be events that frequently happened and may or may not have happened while my dad was in a relationship with someone.

So for starter, I was a loner at school. I was shunned from every kind of group there was (it was a very small village so we were around 200 kids at school from kindergarten to highest grade elementary school). Sometimes I was included in the only female group of my class, but most of the time I wasn't.

I ate linden on breaks and played with insects like bees and bumblebees without hurting them, just catch and observe them. I was incredibly lonely, looking back on it. I can't describe with any kind of word how it feels even now. Just incredibly lonely and alone.

Now it's time to enter the main issue, food. Food was a problem until I was 14 years old. I'll try to explain as best I can. When I was around 6 a doctor came to see us (a doctor came once a year in school to track our health) and showed concern about my weight, I was underweight. For reference I was 18kg at 6 yo with a height of 114cm (2kg underweight), another better exemple was the last entry of my height and weight at 10yo, 24kg and 134cm (8kg underweight from normal girls my age) I was the same height as a 9yo and weight as a 7 and a halfyo. Anyways, the female doctor showed concern and asked to visit my house, so she did, my dad showed her the full cupboard of food and she left. That was the last time someone did something, if it was something. 

Still on the same subject, food punishement was common, for example, if I took too long to eat, I would eat in the toilet, on the toilet bowl (my dad didn't like slow eaters and I was one, unfortunately). The more I disliked the food, the longer it took for me to eat, sometimes up to 3hs and then toilet. My dad always ate alone on the couch in the living room, while me and my brother ate alone in the kitchen, we didn't find it weird, even now. One day my dad decided to double my food portions, which made me throw up the entire night, alone in the bathroom, just in front of his room. Didn't come to check on me once.

I'm not sure what to call it, but my dad would always kick my butt or slap the back of my head if I walked in front of him in the house, though it didn't mean to walk behind him. It was just easy to hit me since I was in his reach. Maths was and will always be my nemesis. I had very poor grade from the youngest age but for good reasons. My dad was strong in maths and couldn't tolerate me being bad at it (my brother being strong in maths didn't help), I would sit entire afternoon in front of maths problems my dad made for me, slapping my head if I took too long to answer or gave wrong answer. It was like that for years.

I was always well behaved compared to my brother, at least at school. He would fight on a regular basis (most likely from the abuse at home, he had to exteriorate his anger), racking up demerit points on his behavior permit (like a driver license but for behavioral purposes, lose points if you're a bad kid). I think I was hyperactive when I was with my mom, she had troubles with us, since we couldn't act as kids with our dad, we would do everything we couldn't at my mom's. She told me how difficult it was for her to take care of us (she made it sound like we weren't being abused verbally and physically on a daily basis)

Still on the point of food, we would eat expired things on a regular basis, it doesn't bother me to eat expired things as long as there's no mold in it or it doesn't smell bad, even my brother. Expired milk was probably the worst thing I tasted, I now always smell every time I open the bottle, even if it was opened earlier in the day. My mom told me she gave us snacks for the week but he would give us expired ones. My grandma would give us a box of food on sundays but my dad never gave it to us. He also took away all the birthdays and christmas money we received from my dad's dad (around 50 or 100‚Ç¨ each).

It took a turn for the worse when we were 9yo, my dad met his girlfriend from hell, and her mom who I would like to refer to as Satan. The gf from hell started controlling our food intake, even before we met her. We started eating 1 bowl of soup at lunch and 1 bowl of soup at dinner, no vegetables, rice, pasta, meat on the side. A plain bowl of soup for 6 months a year, for 5 years until I was 14. Which explains the 8kg underweight when I was 10. I found a picture when I was around 12yo, I had no fat, you could see the skin stretching from the armpit to the collarbone. Nobody felt alarmed, no adult ever came to me asking if everything was ok at home, despite moving 2 times and went to 3 different schools. Nobody.

I'll try to fit in everything I remember from before I was 10yo, before I moved town, before moving on with the story. On that note, I was doing sports, gymnastics from 6 to 8 years old. I liked it, I originally wanted to do football (or soccer depending from where you read it) but was told it wasn't for girls (my dad was a football referee) by my dad. My brother was also refused to do football and went on to learn taekwondo. Small accidents happened to me while I was doing gymnastics, from a broken tooth to a twisted ankle, but nothing worth mentionning. 

One day, my classmate David who was doing gymnastics with me, told me his dad couldn't drive me there today (his dad would drive us both there everytime) so I understood and went home at the end of school. Another classmate, or at least someone I knew, invited me over to his house on the way back. Now I will explain properly so you have the proper idea of the context. His house was on the same road, same side, around 2 houses away from my house, probably 10-15 meters if not shorter, it was less than a minute walk to my house. you could see my house and his house on the same road. I want to be clear on this part. Anyways, I went to his house and told his mom to call my dad, to tell him I was staying here and would leave at 18h (time I ended gymnastics usually), she called him and told him where I was. I heard him over the phone saying ok and thanking her or whatever, anyways, point is, he knew where I was, who I was with, and how long I would be staying. I did my part. Later on when time was up, I bid farewell to the mom and kid and left the house. As soon as I stepped out, my dad's car was driving very fast, stopped abruptedly in front of me, making a screeching noise. He stepped out, furious, grabbed me by the collar and slammed me against the car, he pressed on my chest with his arm and started screaming at me, about how he had no idea where I was, called the cops etc etc. I knew he was lying since I heard him on the phone. He kept screaming for a while and we went home. I didn't have dinner that day and went to sleep around 19h (7pm). My brother too but for another issue.

Another time, when we were with probably his first girlfriend N (with her kid younger than us) my dad wanted to show off in front of her, so he grabbed my collar (I was like 6 or 7) and lifted me up with his pinky, my head touching the ceiling and my back against the wall. I would've most likely broken something had he dropped me. 

And before moving on, my neighbor who was also my classmate, would steal my snacks at school for months and eat them in the toilets (we had snack time every day at 16h (4pm) and I was left with eating nothing, which further explained my weight, again.

Moving on to the main part, I'll try to keep it short since the post is already very long and there's still a couple of topics to talk about.

Arriving 10 years old we moved town to live in the same town as the gf from hell and Satan. gf from hell had 3 children, the oldest being a year younger than us, very obese for her age and 2 youngers siblings, each 3 years apart, so 9, 6 and the youngest, only male, 3yo. respectively G, M and D. G was obese, while the others were normal weights, I'm not fat shaming, it has its importance for later.

We at first lived in a flat, around 15 mins by car from their house, in the ""ghetto"" part of the town, the ""bad"" side of the town. My brother was robbed 3 times of his phone in the course of living there. We had our pet dog, medium to tall sized dog, who was called Belle. Belle was another problem on its own so I'll dedicate a part to her, because I love her still and I want to tell her story too.

The very first day of school in the new town, was a test day, the whole class had a test on various subjects, which I didn't do, since I was behind on program and had to catch up first. So I spent the day reading material instead. Now for context, my brother was in the same class as G (oldest daughter) (we had to old back a year at 6 because our academics were lacking). The teacher of their class was a friend of the gf from hell so she told her about the test etc. Around a week later the results were out, we were at the flat with my dad and brother, my dad saw the test results for my brother and started to ask me about it, I told him I didn't do it. He asked me a again, I told him I didn't do it. I didn't have time to start explaining, from the stress of him asking and the fact I wasn't a good speaker (I grew up barely talking) didn't help the situation. So next thing I saw was his raised fist into a punch, feeling the punch on my left eye and fell on my butt, still surprised it didn't bruise. Not the best experience.

I was mocked and shunned again at the new school, which didn't change from before, apart from the mocking being more frequent than last school. I'm not sure how my grades were that year, I'd say average (we score from a 20 point, average being 10).

I'll keep this section short since my memories only cover a few very distinct stuff that happened. Every day was what I would describe as emotional torture, or at least psychological torture. I can't describe well, it's just how I feel, even now after forgetting most of the 4 years with them. Every day one of us (between me, brother and dad), or several of us, sometimes us all, would be scold from the gf from hell and Satan, all evening they would find fault with something that happened during the day, overreacting or fabricating just for the purpose of scolding. Yelling until 3 am every day.

One day when we came back from our mom's on sunday evening, we asked our dad what we would be scolded on this time, he shrugged and said there's no reason for it to happen. We walk in the house and immediately get scolded for towel tabbelware missplaced or whatever.

I had to tie my hair in a very specific, ugly way the entire 4 years, once some hair were stranded and Satan pulled on it very hard, so it pissed me off greatly, on our way to school I vented my anger verbally about how I'd keep her locked up and torture her, sadly G listened attentively and reported it back to Satan after school. I wasn't allowed to talk to her or kiss her cheek as greeting for months (we greet each other be smacking the cheek on each side every time we meet someone, it's a french thing) I didn't particularly care tbh but I pretented to be remorseful of my actions, just so I wouldn't be scolded further about it.

One time I think it was either about a grade or the yearly total grade, I was being yelled at by gf from hell, calling me all kinds of stuff, about being bad academically (I had around 13/20 which is considered ok/decent), while she, on the other hand, couldn't write properly and my dad had to write for her. Funny stuff, really. Anyways, I yelled back at her, saying it wasn't fair that I was yelled at, and how she wouldn't say anything to her daughter if she had same grades as me, I was met with a slap, and made go outside with a thin top, in the wintery cold. I stayed outside until my dad came out while Satan watched me by the window with a grin, making sure I was staying here.

I wasn't allowed to shave (I'm part portuguese from my mom's side so my hair is kind of thick and dark) which contributed to the bullying I was subjected to in middle school. I was also made wear very large pants from the obese daughter, I ressembled a clown, I was very embarassed each time I wore them to school, already being ugly from the forced haircut.

Satan wanted me to have short hair while my dad wanted me to have long hair, so more than a few times she decided to cut it, never asking about my opinion.

I was't allowed to change in another room even when I reached puberty. I changed in the same room as all the children, gf from hell, Satan, brother and dad. Once I crouched to change and gf from hell said there's nothing to hide anyways. She also made me show my very first bra, on myself, to my dad, I had to show him my growing breasts. At 12 years old.

Probably the last entry from that time since most of the stuff is forgotten, thanks to my brain protecting me. We were in a commercial center, and G dared me to give myself a hickey on my arm, which I did. She proceeded to tell her mom about the ""bruise"" and she told my dad to bring me to the pharmacy. My dad, the entire way there, blamed me about how I ruin everything, all the time, as soon as people have a somehow good time, here I am, ruining the day. After a while we finished shopping so I went with my brother and dad to the car. Once inside, my dad would start yelling at me to get out of the car so he could run me over. He kept saying it while I was melting to the back of the seat from how I was retreating in fear. I told gf from hell and Satan on the way back and they scolded my dad, saying he took it too far. I didn't have to go in the same car as him for a while, only time I was grateful.

I forgot to mention my dad would always threaten us to abandon us in the forest each time we drove past it.

Now before moving on, my mom got custody of us 2 weeks a month when we were 14 years old because gf from hell got greedy for allocation money and lost. My dad, who told us he would abandon us if he lost, never respected verdict. Instead we didn't see him a couple of months and started seeing him 1 weekend out of 2 (which was originally what he wanted my mom to do) until I was 17yo.

I'll talk about my dog here, I want to warn people who are weak to animal abuse, skip this paragraph if it's the case. My dog grew up with us, she was very well behaved, very sweet, the dog I loved the most (I'm a cat person) my dad left her outside the house, no matter the weather. We brought her inside the house without my dad's knowledge on wednesdays (we didn't see our mom on wednesdays after some time), and made her sleep on my bed for some time. My dad would barely feed her, instead our good hearted neighbor just in front of our house, gave us a small pack of meat regularly for her, alongside snacks for us, that we ate secretly and hid the packages so my dad would never catch us. He regularly beat her when we were in the flat, grabbing her by the collar and punching her stomach. I would hear faint cries when he did that, often falling asleep to this sound. We were the ones taking her on walks at 5am and before going to bed. He decided to abandon Belle to my mom when he went to live full time with gf from hell, since she didn't want another dog. Belle died a couple of years later, from a tumor and old age at 17yo. I hope she's in peace and lived in peace with my mom and us. I regret not being able to help her as I was also too young to take action.

I had my first bf and only ex at 17. I won't go into details since, once again, I forgot most of it. I stayed with him for 4 years. I wasn't allowed to wear pajamas to sleep, since he wanted to be able to touch anywhere he pleased anytime. Often being touched down there in the mornings while still asleep, repeatedly telling him to stop waking me up every morning. He raped me the first time he wanted to try anal, without my consent. I kept telling him I didn't want to try, he still did. He kept telling me yes, I kept telling me no. I started crying as he didn't stop. Kept going. Was met with a ""I'm almost there"". I started crying louder so he would hear me. He finally stopped. I stayed still for 24hs, naked, against the end of the bed, trying my best so he wouldn't touch me even a little bit. I pondered leaving right here and now but I didn't want to be alone again. Loneliness is one hell of a torture. I knew I would most likely unalive myself if I left. So I stayed. That's the only time I would say he raped me but my psychologist and current boyfriend say otherwise. For further context, my ex would give me the silent treatment if I refused sexual acitivities, other time he would just masturbate to porn in the same room as protest. So most of the time I reluctantly agreed to it, even though I didn't want to. A particular detail is I lubricate very easily, and most of the time I'd be dry after a while, while in action, which further indicates even my body didn't want it. So the rapes would actually amount to thousands since we did it for up to 4 times a day. I cried every single night I slept next to him for over 2 years.

I'll stop talking about my ex since I don't want to give him any shine, he's a piece of trash, egoistical prick, who didn't account for anyone's feelings apart from his. I hate him and always will.

I also deep cut my finger because of the gf from hell who told me to work even though I didn't have gloves and had 3 stitches because of her. Almost lost a finger.

Anyways, surprisingly I survived all of this. From starving to psychological torture and abuse and made it to 28. I had to take medication to find proper sleep after 10 years of barely sleeping, with daily nightmares and waking up every 3hs every single night. Unfortunately overweight because of the medication but I started working out last week. I hate humans, and always will. I suffer from dissociation from past traumas so I don't really feel anything from it all. 

I've been with my current boyfriend for 6 years now, it took me a lot of time to not act like I did with my ex (I cried everytime I refused sex with him because I was scared he would give me the silent treatment or get mad at me), he's very understanding of my personal space needs and takes my feelings seriously. 

I hate my family, all of them, I hate all the people who watched me grow up in fear and misery and didn't try to do anything for fear of my dad. and I hate all of my dad's ex girlfriends who were nothing short of criminals.

I hope nobody lives through what I went through, and I would never go into the past for any kind of money. And I wish my dog peace and joy in her sleep. 

Thank you for reading if you made it this far, I appreciate someone reading what I couldn't say until I was 26. I hope you're loved and I hope you will be the change in someone's life. Thank you.",ptsd

"I just found out something horrible about someone & not sure what to do Trigger warning: Abuse & SA mention, su!c!de mention, discussion of CSA/pedophiles 

I‚Äôve known someone since I was 15. 

For half of my life this person has been a caring and supportive person for me. I have defended and believed in this person despite knowing their criminal charges they did time for when they were young.

Growing up with a presumed NPD mother that I was the emotional caretaker for, I always knew that people hurt others because they experienced some trauma and are hurting. I‚Äôm also autistic and take people very literally and at their word. So when people tell me they are working on themselves and trying to recover and do better, I believe them, and support them. I just try to be as understanding as possible, and I think it stems from how little understanding I received as an autistic person.

In my teens I got mixed up with a guy a year older than me. He told me we were best friends. I believed him. He told me one time how his ex gf who he regularly called crazy accused him of raping her, and I defended him. As time went on he would tell me all my bf‚Äôs were controlling me when they had problems with our friendship/him, once told me how he compared every girl to me and couldn‚Äôt see himself with them long term (idealizing me much, ick), and proposed to me twice. If I set boundaries with his behavior I was uncomfortable with i‚Äôd be told I misunderstand and he doesn‚Äôt have feelings for me, it‚Äôs just jokes/were just friends so it‚Äôs okay. It went on for almost ten years. Turns out he was a liar, and manipulated, groomed me by slowly getting me comfortable with touching and talking about sex and increasing the type of touching/topic of sex, pressured, and eventually coerced me into sexual situations I was uncomfortable with and didn‚Äôt want in my early 20s, was trying to manipulate me into moving in with him, then only needing one bedroom, marrying him, then started a smear campaign against me the last almost ten years about how I cheated and accused him of rape to get away with it before I had even accepted what he did counted as sexual assault. He told people I was his gf, I was using him, and he almost bought me a horse property I only told him about because my horse trainer was discussing buying it.

A few years ago, I became friends with someone else. He used to be friends with the guy from the above paragraph, and admitted to me that the above guy ‚Äòtaught him how to get girls.‚Äô He later admitted to me that he left our high school back in the day because everyone ‚Äòhated him‚Äô because abuse he ‚Äòfucked everyone‚Äôs girlfriends.‚Äô He ended up lying to me about everything that made him who he supposedly was, playing victim in the situation with his ex gf and said she cheated on him (when she didn‚Äôt), told me how he had made mistakes (cheated on exes relentlessly) and was working on himself, lovebombed me, very possibly drugged and raped me the very first time, later pressured assaulted and raped me another time, and was extremely abusive. When I broke it off with him he had a psychotic episode and wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone, and I was a bad person for not comforting him while he was suicidal. I just wanted to be anywhere but around him, he was terrifying. He added onto the rumors my first abuser spun and claimed I also cheated on him, when he cheated on me with about 9 people‚Äîit made me realize that both of these guys went after girls in relationships to claim the girls were cheaters in order to get away with their predatory behavior and they had a whole organized system to relieve them from feeling any guilt and turn the blame on their victims. This guy specifically has many abuse victims and at least one other rape victim.

The last couple years the smear campaign has ruined my life. I lost everyone all over again due to them being told I‚Äôm some pathological liar and cheater, a narcissist, encouraged multiple people to play mind games and psychologically abuse me,m, etc. I ended up in the hospital, I almost committed suicide, I‚Äôve completely isolated myself. I‚Äôm still not recovered. I still have nightmares. My ability to function sexually is ruined, I don‚Äôt feel safe ever. It hurts so bad to have not been believed, and to have been made the target on ongoing abuse preformed by people for my abusers. It‚Äôs so fucked up.

I wouldn‚Äôt be alive today if it wasn‚Äôt for the support of this man I‚Äôve known since I was 15. He is in his 60s. He really helped me out in a time of need. He was patient with me and pushed me when I needed it. I‚Äôve known for like 10 years he was charged with sexual assault of a minor by knifepoint when he was somewhere around 18-21. He did prison time. He did therapy for 15 years, had a very traumatic childhood. I have believed he was reformed and was giving back to the community. But there‚Äôs been a lot of drama in our industry community due to his behavior with one young girl a couple years ago who had a bad home life, and everyone was bringing up his past again (like they would do every couple years). I understand her parents concern, as he was buying the girl a lot of special gifts and spending a lot of time with her. After he lost access, it‚Äôs been like he went through a bad breakup and is heartbroken and missing her constantly. He‚Äôs also been trying to get involved with more and more kids activities, and he should keep boundaries for himself knowing he can‚Äôt do that. Recently he settled a court case from one of his old victims suing him, and told me they were just coming after him because they thought he had a lot of money now. It‚Äôs been rubbing me the wrong way.

A friend dug up the reports. 

We read the victims testimony, and this man‚Äôs letter to the judge. She was 9, and he was 18. A third victim. Her testimony was so triggering and I cried multiple times. It was too relatable for me. She was a baby. He stalked her for 7 years after he lost access to her and reached out multiple times. He had reached out to her just a couple years ago to send a letter about how much he still loved her!! It‚Äôs what started the court case! In his letter to the judge, he talks about how he wasn‚Äôt trying to ‚Äòget back together with her‚Äô as if they were ever together. He talks about the situation when he was around her when she was a kid, how he was in love with her and she loved him too. How her parents said if she was older they would have approved. It‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt acknowledge how angry and hurt she was when she called him after getting his letter and screaming at him to leave her alone.

It‚Äôs fucking weird to read how he thinks and talks about the situation, the letter, the phone call they had, and twists shit. The stark difference in their accounts. She was terrified of him, and he was and is still ‚Äòin love‚Äô? I guess I always thought deep down predators intentionally lied and twisted the narrative despite my therapist explaining they often believe they have genuine affection and love for their victims, even to the point of obsession due to many being fit for cluster B disorders. But to see it, really see it this way, is so fucking weird and gross and bizarre. I finally see his behavior with the little girl as predatory and I don‚Äôt know if he has reoffended since getting out of jail, but I believe he was in a losing battle around that girl and would eventually give in if he had continued to have access to her. My friend described it like an addiction, and he got a taste of it again.

I‚Äôm horrified over what I‚Äôve learned. I‚Äôm disgusted with myself. I hate that I am so understanding and accepting and want to see the best in people that I end up blindly believing abusers. Even still I want to ask him for the truth and tell him he should go back to therapy, and trust in his desire to be better, but uncovering lies he has spun shows he will just lie and isn‚Äôt safe. Why the fuck am I surrounded by abusers every where I look??? Oh my god",ptsd

"Nearby shooting that happened last month  I have been struggling to deal with a shooting that happened on my way home from a commute. It happened over a month ago as I was coming back from university. I was just chilling on the platform watching a show waiting for my train to go back home. When this group of kids started running from a direction and kind of pushed me back. I was confused and kinda frustrated but I just looked back down at my phone but then I heard multiple gunshots right next to me. 

I was like is this a joke and I was not about to find out so I ran for my life. I usually commute so I‚Äôve been scared to go back on the train or even drive through the neighborhood because I have a horrible anxiety and get panic attacks thinking about it. I haven‚Äôt been to class much since so I kinda think I‚Äôm cooked. Does anyone have any tips on how I can conquer the fear of going back on the train? I hate driving there cuz it‚Äôs a shitty neighborhood where gun violence is prevalent. ",ptsd

"Found out my adoptive dad doesn‚Äôt even believe me and never did My adoptive dad told my birth mom that he doesn‚Äôt believe I was telling the truth. I confronted him today about it and asked why he thinks that. His reasoning, they came and got me out of the boarding school when they found out the only good staff member was fired for trying to make changes. He seemed to be under the impression that I told him about the molestation and that‚Äôs why they picked me up but that‚Äôs just not the case. Second reason, my oldest brother and my sister knew about it months before them. And the third reason, I didn‚Äôt tell them when it actually happened. 

The way my parents found out was because I described what happened to my therapist. I didn‚Äôt realize sexual abuse isn‚Äôt just when penetration is involved because I was 12 when it happened. My therapist explained how it was sexual abuse/molestation. She then told me to tell my parents and asked if I wanted her help to try to press charges. I said yes. I told my parents. They told my siblings. This is all about a year maybe a year and a half after it happened. 

My siblings might have found out because in one of the hotels we stayed in for a chess tournament we ended up in the EXACT SAME ROOM that the guy that molested me lost his butterfly knife. I knew it was the exact same room because they had thrown me onto the bed in the right and jumped on me and humped me breaking the bed. The bed was still broken. The room was identical. Maybe I mentioned it then but idk.

My adoptive dad accused me of making whatever I want up about the past to suit my needs. I‚Äôve never lied about the past. It honestly really hurts me that he doesn‚Äôt believe me. And I told him it wasn‚Äôt ok that he told my biological parents when he first met with them when I was 13. It took me years to work up the courage to tell my birth mom, and to find out they already knew. I assumed he told them when my narcissistic birth dad mentioned ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been through the same things as you‚Äù and mentioned being sexually abused by his dad. In his case it‚Äôs definitely a lie, he‚Äôs left his dad alone with his kids and me. And he‚Äôs a liar. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, my adoptive dad doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me because he thinks everything I say is a lie. He‚Äôs literally accusing me of doing the exact thing my birth dad is actually doing. And it‚Äôs something I would never do.

Yeah a lot apparently). Depressed. Can't really cope with going to college and starting my new job anymore- all I want to do is be in bed where it's safe and I can feel fine. I'm scared of fucking everything- I had such a bad episode the other day that I almost called a fucking ambulance on myself. New triggers that I didn't realise were triggers- sometimes it's hard to figure out WHY it's triggering. What the fuck am I so scared of? It doesn't matter. I just can't stop. I have so much to do and I just can't do it anymore. Therapists won't listen to me- it's just fucking hopeless. I'm this close to starting to drink again, or starting to sh again, or just anything because I'm actually going to implode. Somebody give me a sedative!!! I have work on Friday. I don't know how the fuck to have a job!! I have to walk home in the dark even though it won't be that late. I could have a panic attack just thinking about it. I feel surges of panic every time someone comes near me in public. I just want to be left alone. By everyone else and by my head. I panicked going to the bathroom the other day because my bathroom's lights come on automatically and they were too bright and it's not meant to be a trigger but it scared me out of nowhere. I'm so spaced out. This life is legit hell and I don't want to do it anymore. Stupid stupid things that I shouldn't be scared of and I'm sick of the fact I am scared. I feel like someone's behind me all the time. I feel like I'll throw up from anxiety all the time. My acne is soo bad because I've started picking at my face more. I've started to wake up doing it again. I want to kill my brain because none of this makes sense and I'm not completely convinced that I'm not dying over and over and over. My friend had to tell me in my episode (because unfortunately I had to tell SOMEONE) that I was having a panic attack over and over and over and I couldn't believe it. I walked into the hall and the lights were too bright and for a second I saw it. I look for blood in the sink without realising that's what I'm looking for. I feel it on my hands when I'm sweaty. I didn't leave my bed until 7pm the next day. I feel sick and tired because my life is stuck and it wasn't even that serious and it's like I'm looking for reasons to be fucked up everywhere (it's like I WANT to be traumatised) and I just want to buy a pack of blades and take it into my own hands instead.",ptsd

"Doctor anxiety  TW: assault. 
I know my doctor won‚Äôt be mad at me. I know she won‚Äôt force things on me. I know she‚Äôs so kind, yet I‚Äôve experienced trauma from such a young age and into my late teen years. I‚Äôm 21 now and only truly just starting to process it and the anxiety I always had seems to be getting worse. I always knew I was hit and physically abused, but I‚Äôve only begun processing the sexual abuse last year. Years after it happened. I‚Äôm so averted to touch that I don‚Äôt even let them take my blood pressure or weight. I‚Äôm not ready to see a therapist about this but if I don‚Äôt I‚Äôll never get over it. My friend jokingly told me to just ‚Äúget over it‚Äù about a doctor touching my pr1vates and they knew I was sexually assaulted by my ex. They don‚Äôt know the extent, but they left the room and I just began to bawl and texted my mom since we share the same doctor. She reassured me and she doesn‚Äôt even know the extent of anything. No one does. I‚Äôll tell certain people bits and pieces, but nobody knows the extent of what happened. There‚Äôs so many things that have happened that I can‚Äôt even seem to remember. I feel like I purposely trigger myself by logging into the doctors website to look at whatever is on there. I‚Äôll see things like ‚Äúhpv vaccine‚Äù or ‚Äústd screening‚Äù and then shut down into hysteria. I‚Äôm asexual with an intense fear of needles and physical touch. I haven‚Äôt had any vaccine in years. I‚Äôve had majority of them done but my fears have grown and grown more. I got into contact with my old childhood doctor and as we talked she said that my physical aversion to touch and my fear of needles began to spike at the same time making me wonder if they could be related. I have so many gaps in my memories with years upon years of things missing. I feel like there‚Äôs so many things wrong with me that I feel guilty for even seeing my doctor. I‚Äôm scared she‚Äôll be upset I need so many accomidations or help. I‚Äôm on the spectrum and I have ADHD, too which makes everything amplified times 10. Especially touch. I never liked it, but after the assault (that I can even remember) it became a hatred.

"People are lying about someone having sexual pictures of me is that harassment? 17F I already have unresolved trauma from being raped. I go to college and I‚Äôm really upset because  there‚Äôs this guy in the college who‚Äôs a creep. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a rapist but there‚Äôs rumours that he is. But for some reason there‚Äôs also rumours about me to make him look like even more of a creep because he‚Äôs 20 and I‚Äôm only 17 so that‚Äôs illegal if he did have pictures of me. People are saying that he has sexual pictures of me without any more details. Which makes it sound like I‚Äôve sent him nudes. Which I HAVENT I only tolerate him and he‚Äôs not my type. The thing is as well I barely know the people who are spreading these rumours. Like one of them I didn‚Äôt even know who she was because this is a mostly new class.

And I only found out about the rumours because it spread to someone from another class who knows me and he was kind enough to tell me even though they were telling him not to tell me. I honestly am so upset. I feel like if they are making this up that‚Äôs an insult to people who have actually been raped like me. And if that‚Äôs true that‚Äôs awful and I hope they recover I know how hard that can be but I don‚Äôt understand why they are still spreading rumours around that he has indecent photos of me. I think that‚Äôs a lie whether the rest of it is false or true because surely if they knew this they wouldn‚Äôt want to keep that away from me. And unless I completely missed him taking weird pictures of me there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôd have photos of me.

I don‚Äôt understand why everywhere I go I seem to get sexualised. I got raped multiple at 8,sexually assaulted at 12 and raped again at 14 then harrassed and assaulted at 16 and now at 17 this is happening I don‚Äôt know if this is considered harassment. But it feels like it. Maybe because of the trauma. It really hurts. I feel like my life is over. And I feel like everyone thinks I‚Äôm a slut now. And I guess I am probably the most sexually experienced person in my class and I‚Äôm hypersexual.

But I don‚Äôt get why. I have never really been openly sexual in college. Like I haven‚Äôt said much sexual at all I don‚Äôt think I can even remember a time I‚Äôve said anything sexual. Maybe like a year ago. But yeah I‚Äôm not like openly sexual. So the fact these people especially since they are people who I‚Äôve not met before September are saying these sexual things about me is so confusing. 

I honestly feel really anxious. I don‚Äôt know if this is considered harassment so I haven‚Äôt reported it or anything. Honestly if it continues tho I‚Äôm considering going to the police. If they do have sexual images of me that‚Äôs a crime. And even if it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs borderline harassment. I don‚Äôt want everyone to think of me like that. It makes me more vulnerable. I don‚Äôt want to get bullied or raped. And I feel like them saying this puts me at a risk to being those things. 

Maybe that‚Äôs the ptsd talking but genuinely I‚Äôm so embarrassed and pissed off.",ptsd

I‚Äôm a pre-vet student right now.

"Thinking about making an app to track emotions between therapy sessions‚Äîam I on the right track? I'm a college sophomore majoring in CS who's been thinking a lot about a mental health project, and I've got an idea I'm not sure about.

Personally, I find it really hard to keep track of my mental health progress between therapy sessions. I leave feeling motivated, but then life happens, days blur together, and by the time my next session comes around, I can barely remember how I felt throughout the week or what I wanted to discuss. There's no easy way to log my day-to-day feelings and none of my therapy notes are remembered.

I'm thinking about creating a transcription app that would record and transcribe therapy sessions. It would also let you jot down thoughts, track moods, and maybe even set reminders based on your therapy notes to check in with yourself. The idea is to have everything in one place to make it easier to stay on track when I'm not in therapy.

I'd really appreciate any thoughts, experiences, or advice. Just trying to figure out if this idea is worth pursuing. Please comment what do you think and below are some responses that can help me. Feel free to leave a number and I extremely appreciate your opinion!

I have a hard time differentiating between a gut feeling telling me that something isn't right and my mind playing tricks on me and telling me that I can never undo the trauma, that I'm a terrible person, that I'm beyond fixing, and that I need to keep people at a distance in order to protect them",ptsd

"How can you accept giving up control? CW: I write a little about feeling helpless and being abused in a medical setting. (Being careful about triggers and am vague in details because I don't know what is a trigger to others.)

I need surgery for something that is in the early stages, but could potentially make me very ill, damage organs, or even kill me if left untreated and decides to get worse. When I was a child/younger I was abused by several healthcare professionals and my parents in different ways that I won't go into much detail about, but it left me with PTSD. I've been in treatment for my mental health, but I don't feel ready to take on this challenge. Unfortunately this came up suddenly and I have basically no choice. Have the surgery, give up control, and potentially add more traumatic flashbacks, or don't and potentially get sicker.

Important context is that for many years the learned helplessness I had was so bad I just disassociated and let people do whatever they wanted to me, which just caused more and more trauma. With decades of therapy I'm now more likely (but not 100%) to freak out, stand up for myself and refuse treatment, or just leave if I don't trust something. But I remember what it was like before, vividly.

I've done everything I can to try and not cancel my surgery, I've talked to so many people and gotten some accommodations like a quiet room before surgery, but I wake up every day saying ""no I don't want this"". Just reading instructions for the surgery I have to stop because I start panicking and feel nauseous. I can't separate it from those old feelings of being treated like an animal or piece of meat, and I can't trust that the staff have my best interests in mind, even though some of them are the nicest people and seem competent. Nice people in my experience are sometimes hiding horrible things.

I had to go to the hospital for a pre operative appointment, and I kept having panic attacks and wasn't able to speak properly to the staff I needed to speak to. The words often wouldn't come out. I was getting triggered constantly by things in the hospital interior, and the worst was seeing other patients in beds being wheeled around helplessly. When I had to pass by the surgery areas, seeing the doors and some of the rooms when the doors opened filled me with such dread that I was sick. I felt like I was in a slaughterhouse for humans. Whenever I try to envision what will happen to me in a calm, rational way, I feel like I'm about to be violated again.

I explained to staff how I feel but I don't think all of them really got it. They want to give me all kinds of drugs to calm me down, but I'm also panicking about that. That means I have to give up control and be in that helpless state again, where they can do whatever they want. My brain DOES NOT want that. I don't know what to do. I just can't trust them. My gut says no almost every time. I have one more therapy session before my surgery date, but I feel like I've done everything I can other than ask online. What the heck can I do at this point to be at peace with this? This is supposed to help me this time but there's a constant voice of ""are you suuuurrre?"" in the back of my mind right before my brain remembers all the things that have happened again and again. I don't want more memories that keep me up at night and intrude in my mind all day long like bolts of lightning. I don't want the surgery to go bad again and then I'll have another regret and scar on my body to remind me every time I look in the mirror.",ptsd

"Had a very bad episode A few days ago, I had a very bad episode where my perception of my surrounding started to mix with flashback. For a moment, I felt like my appartement had turned into a cell, (I live a small appartement) I could still see my appartement but I had the impression it became a holding cell for a moment. I'm a victim of defamation, and had to be put in police custody because of procedure in my country, no matter if you are guilty, suspected or not suspected, if someone went to accused you, you have to be held in custody for at least a few hours before they decide if you are innocent or if your case will be decided in court. I was proven innocent without the need to go to court but ever since then all of this and outside context which add to that led to have sometimes have flashbacks of everything that happened, but it was the first time I had one concerning my time in that cell. 

I also think my time in that cell also made me a bit claustrophobic. Defamtion made me hardly trust anyone, I watched as someone I trusted deeply betrayed me and manipulated people I know to consider me a horrible person. And then said person tried to ruin me evern further. Now I scared of ever seeing that person or the one that blindly trusted her, refusing to hear me out not even wanting to hear my side of the story. Which made terrified of going outside to some places and I actively avoid them, leading me to move away from the city where it happened. Sometimes, I see her in flashbacks, I see them too, I hear voices of people turning against me. Even when I know there is no way she is around I'm scared of my surrounding.

"Trouble supporting others  I don't know how to help my sibling. We have a troubled relationship and I long ago considered them my bully. I think their struggles are connected to undiagnosed ADHD. I am dx ASD. 

I had experiences as a young child, teen, and young adult that led to PTSD dx at 19. I received treatment 15 years later and am not experiencing PTSD now. 

Following my experiences and dx my family did not respond well and I was low contact for around 5 years. Contact is still fairly light but it is somewhat functional. One of the issues was that my family deemed what happened to me to affect my sibling worse and I was asked to support them through it even though I was unsupported.

I managed to overcome a lot and am proud of myself. I recently had a serious relapse with psychosis and responded well to treatment. Sadly during that time my parent died. 

My sibling has still not recovered from what happened to me and now is not recovering from our bereavement. I have encouraged them to seek professional help, I sent a list of nearby suitable doctors, I talk with them about how they can manage their symptoms. But they don't do anything. 

I am scared their language and behaviour threatens my recovery. I am worried about some feelings I have about their pain being treated as worse than mine. I feel guilty about those feelings. It's so very important to believe people but I am struggling to understand if the PTSD terms they are using reflects what I understand to be PTSD. I am scared that these conflicting feelings might bring the psychosis back.

Does anyone have any insight into how to manage relationships with others who don't seem to seek healing?

"PTSD causing panic attacks with weight loss? TW: childhood trauma My HW is 350 CW 224. 

It seems like whenever I get close to 200 I start having panic attacks. I'm 32 and I've been obese since childhood. 

I remember as a kid thinking if I get fat I won't be a target for predators. I also felt safer because it's harder to kill or kidnap a fat person.

I do have a therapist so I'll talk to her in a couple weeks about this. I'm just curious if others have gone through the same and how you coped? ",ptsd

fast forward to now, i‚Äôve been married for almost a decade & i‚Äôve been going to therapy for a year (& made so much progress). therapy isn‚Äôt just for these assaults but a lifetime of abuse from various people. 

thing is, i just don‚Äôt feel sexual arousal. i feel a constant pressure to ‚Äòperform‚Äô. i know that my husband just wants a normal sex life & to have fun together (he never pushes anything & is unbelievably patient) but i just don‚Äôt feel the desire for that. i want to want that - but i feel like that side of me was crushed as i was growing up.

In the beginning, I thought it was just one flashback I had to eliminate and then things would be great. Unfortunately not. I think someone on the posts mentioned that trauma is collective which is true. Processing is bringing up so much more unveiling negative circumstances in a fragmented way and I have to re narrate and tell myself I‚Äôm ok.

"Does ptsd make me ‚Äústupid‚Äù? Recently I‚Äôve been feeling like I‚Äôve become stupid. I am currently in a 1 year master‚Äôs program but everything feels different. I understand that master‚Äôs are difficult but there are small things I‚Äôm starting to notice. I am not well articulated anymore, I cannot grasp concepts as easily anymore, forgetful, I space out more often, sometimes I don‚Äôt know where I am for a brief moment. At one point my friend made a joke that I just don‚Äôt know where I am at any time due to a prank where she took away my water bottle in front of me but I didn‚Äôt notice until she pointed it out. 

In December it‚Äôs going to be 2 years since my dad passed away. It was a horrible time for me. My dad  collapsed in my arms when we were dancing together, on the week of my 21st birthday, during my last year of college. He never woke up. My mom began verbally abusing me, and at some point blamed me for his passing. I shut down emotionally. I sucked it up, because I truly thought I was a killer. I took no breaks. While my dad was in the ICU I still took my finals. A week after his funeral I went back to school. I still worked, went to classes, and continued my multiple positions as a board member in multiple organizations. After I graduated I got a 9-5 after a month of job searching. While I was working 9-5 I decided to apply to grad school to get away from my mom. I got accepted and then put in my two weeks June of this year only 3 weeks before the program started. I gave myself a week to buy supplies, move, and another week to adjust to the new setting. Throughout the summer I felt that sometime was off. But it wasn‚Äôt until the fall quarter when I started noticing the difference. It‚Äôs not as intense as the summer so I am just starting to realize how much I‚Äôve changed. I can‚Äôt tell if maybe I‚Äôm making excuses for myself and that I‚Äôve always been stupid. But looking back at old recorded presentations and papers I seemed so different. Maybe I‚Äôm just not trying hard enough. I‚Äôm not sure anymore. If anyone‚Äôs been in a similar situation how did you manage?",ptsd
"I disagreed with my PTSD diagnosis until today (a lot to read I‚Äôm sorry I have always believed I never valued any of the traumatic events that happened to me because I never had flashbacks or anything like that. I never thought I had triggers. I‚Äôm just so beyond detached to myself despite my high self awareness. How I could explain any emotion, event or experience without any vulnerability or feeling to it. I rationalize my thought processes to death and just blow it all off as monkey brain responses that cannot be fixed. I may have accepted what happened but I don‚Äôt think I ever worked through it. 

However I‚Äôm starting to suspect I‚Äôve just maintained such detachment from myself I‚Äôve just been avoiding the truth. 

I am noticing triggers such as an online virtual reality simulation of essentially various social spaces. I‚Äôve had a handful of long distant friend and relationship fallouts, had friends shit talk me, and cheat on me in that space. These things are very real things that happen in real life, so why do I associate that platform as the problem? I just have watched people I love completely losing themselves on that platform. Now, everything can be enjoyed in moderation such as the creativity you can experience on that platform and sense of real connection with virtual reality. 

I made my long distance girlfriend completely get rid of the platform due to a long history we share over it and shitty things she‚Äôs done to me on there. Now she generally is a better person for herself and others when off the platform. I am too. However part of her still yearns to experience that platform to be social and escape there however I get triggered even hearing that‚Ä¶ I know that‚Äôs unfair, I know her complying to this is unfair. She says I live in the past and hopefully we can mature enough to where she can enjoy it at least once a week. That doesn‚Äôt sound bad objectively, so why can‚Äôt I bend on it? 

TL:DR I got fucked over on it. 
She would hyper sexualize herself via her attitude, what she wore, and flirt with her ideal types who would reciprocate throughout our first six months of our relationship. Prior to dating, she has had significant serial dating on there with engaging in a lot of erotic role play on there and drugs. She‚Äôs ghosted me for someone on there multiple times but the last ghosting which caused me to spiral in a lot of reckless behavior, eventually leading to an overdose. I was able to tolerate the game before then and up to a few months in of dating. Prior to this I was being lead on by someone and felt very used. Not too bad objectively. Prior to this, I dated a long time friend while not being ready to quite make that jump (due to the following information) and ruined a friendship. Prior to that, there was a girl I met off of the platform I was dating and stayed with in real life. I think she was abusive as she faked alcohol poisoning and threatened me after, I think she actually pretended to do coke and locked me out. She wanted a throuple a few days later choked me and then threatened to kill me? I don‚Äôt know, I feel no emotion bringing this up? 

My greater issue here isn‚Äôt necessarily my girlfriend, the platform, or any of that. It‚Äôs the inability to exist without her. I could not break up with her while our relationship was at our worst to the point I lost friends due to them struggling to watch me choose to suffer. When I tried to break up with her because I understood how incompatible we were and how I‚Äôm just holding her back from the part of her that misses the platform she feels so passionately about. 

Every excuse I gave was just another form of running away. Not fixing the root problem. I don‚Äôt really think I processed any of what‚Äôs happened to me at all because of how I react. There is a reason I react this way after all. 

I‚Äôve been completely unproductive for over a year now, slowly growing more hopeless in my abilities to function and how poor my distress tolerance is. I‚Äôve started to develop psychosomatic burning sensations in my hands and overwhelming physiological symptoms. It feels like a panic attack that just won‚Äôt end because of this new development. I only feel these mass overwhelming sensations in fear of losing her, sometimes agoraphobia from conditioning of prolonged isolation and avoidance, or in an attempt to leave her or when she tries to break up with me. I suddenly feel like I‚Äôm suffocating, there is a fire of psychosomatic pain I can‚Äôt put out, and anxiety attack symptoms. I have completely become fearful of any kind of pain, I think my brain associate her as the only safe space I can go to even though when I‚Äôm in crisis she does make it worse. As long as I have her presence I can self soothe. 

Truth be told, I take me wherever I go; any issue I have in this or anything, I will carry on into the next. 

I suppose I was in quite the vulnerable place when we started dating and I want to be able or have the ability to exist without her. I‚Äôve struggled with mental health my whole life and trauma I never even acknowledged. I need to be able to figure out how to work through this fear of abandonment, pain, and acknowledgement.

I‚Äôm sorry for providing like all the context you didn‚Äôt ask for. It‚Äôs just there‚Äôs a reason behind the way I hate myself, the way I choose to sit in the fire, how I rationalize myself to stagnancy in what the right choice is because I‚Äôve validated every side, how I refuse to acknowledge myself, how I don‚Äôt use people‚Äôs names when addressing them directly, how I only think I can be funny or a therapist, all of these are learned behaviors to a degree. 

Does anyone have any thoughts? Helpful therapies for Borderline Personality Disorder and Unspecified Trauma Disorder? Anything that‚Äôs personally helped you guys being able to be able to grow out of triggers and essentially face yourself? How to acknowledge yourself as human after dehumanizing yourself? ",ptsd
"Running Into A Wall ... On Fumes ... Out Of Road ... Out Of Time? Look, I've been ""holding on"" and ""hanging in there"" for a while now, and I seem to have survived episode after episode in the past, and maybe I am just in that depression space right now so am not thinking clearly, but it feels ... different lately, has felt different for the better part of the past two years, worse, somehow, even colder and lonelier than before. And I am older and more tired. There is less and less energy to fight this with.   
  
I am struggling to maintain the illusion that anyone actually cares whether I live or die. I know it's an illusion, even if it is a useful one, so why keep pretending otherwise? A few years ago, I still had one or two people in my life who'd occasionally talk to me in a manner that perceived as caring and genuine. Now there is nobody. I ask myself whether it was worth it to hold on, and hang in there, and survive. Am I worth the trouble, when I don't even fully unstand who or what ""I"" even am, outside of the projections, expectations, and impositions of others? My first big trauma, a violent CSA, occurred when I was five, so, presumably, I never really did manage to develop a proper ""self"" beforehand. It feels like it's always been this way, even through all the years when my ""resilient"" child self basically ignored what happened completely.

I'm on meds, in therapy. Have been for years now (should have been for much longer, but my family and school counselors and such basically refused to allow me treatment when I asked, and then for years I was too poor and too busy fighting to survive to access it on my own, and now I only have that access because Obamacare happened). I went to support groups religiously. I've tried attending meetups, making my own meetups, tabletop gaming groups, and so on, and so forth. Just to find some sort of semblance of a healthy support network. But I am middle aged now, and ugly, and broke, and weird, and intense, and still very much autistic, despite a lifetime of heavy masking. I think I'm just ... on my own from here on out...

And fighting is so hard, and getting harder all the time. It's gotten harder yet, now that I'm starting to wonder what am I fighting for? For ""me?"" A person I ostensibly don't really even know? A bundle of emotionally stunted dissociations wrapped in a standard language and expression module? If I keep fighting just to avoid causing a few days or weeks of sadness or inconvenience for others, namely family members who feel contractually obligated to at least pretend to be sad if I'm gone, if not always to accept, nourish, or understand me while I'm here, (and they WILL quickly get over it), then I'm just going to grow to resent them for being my unwitting anchors and torturers, and I'd rather not.

I am not even really sure what I'm hoping for, or what I'm asking. It probably boils down to an impossible abstract, like begging to be told the meaning of life, or why mine in particular happens to matter enough to warrant this continued, rapidly deteriorating state of atrition. That's probably not an answer anyone can give ... but, gosh, I just need ... something ... please ...

"I hate that I have been feeling so bitter and my emotions are on edge.. advice? Is this normal  I‚Äôll try to keep it to the point but obviously have to give backstory. I recently have been diagnosed with childhood PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder. I tried to just touch base on major moments that have happened. Otherwise we‚Äôd be here forever:
-mom had me when she was 19, dad wasn‚Äôt around, was cheating on her and had other kids already. 
-mom did the best she could but was not very there for me emotionally or even supportively such as coming to my sports games, (up until this day actually I still play volleyball and race dirt bikes) she was not a sports person really 
-some bitterness started because my brother played sports and she went to all of his things 
-jump to I‚Äôm 17 almost 18, I get manipulated and taken advantage of by a 42 year old, met him because he was doing the same thing to my friend starting when she was 14. He brainwashed and manipulated her so much that when he wanted someone new she didn‚Äôt see any other way. We stopped being friends because of him. It lasted about a year and a half and after my friend and I reconnected and realized how messed up it was (he pitted us against each other so he could have us both without us ‚Äúknowing‚Äù)
-finally made some peace started dating my friend since 7th grade and we got engaged, shortly after he changed his whole vibe and stated he didn‚Äôt want to get married, when I stated I was okay with it (I was crying still) like I just want to be with him. He replied ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt promise you I will be interested in you tomorrow‚Äù. I stayed. 4 years later he asked ME why we weren‚Äôt married yet, we starting planning again. During this time we discussed me getting a puppy. I say me because it is a dog I have always wanted (he knew) and I was paying for everything, put the deposit down and everything. Time gets closer and I shared a picture of the puppy and he texted me saying ‚ÄúI saw you said you were getting a puppy, we need to talk about that‚Äù that was my last straw and we were done. Had to move back home and readjust my whole work plans. (He‚Äôs now daying the photographer that took all of our couple pictures, including my boudoir shoot for the wedding‚Ä¶) 
-I get my puppy and try to start over. My mom then tells me I have a FULL brother she put up for adoption when he was born, he is not even a full year younger than me (hey Irish twins) 
-I started dating a guy I had known previously, who was recently divorced and has a kid now. I get my substitute license and go back for my Masters degree in early childhood/special Ed, got a new job at a school close by. 
-January of 2023 - my aunt unalived herself 
-June of 2023 - my biological dad unalives himself two days after I have my second sinus surgery
-when I talk to my boss (the superintendent) about all of what happened, she said if I can‚Äôt handle the stress of everything going on then maybe the jobs not for me‚Ä¶. 
-started a new job this August and I am finishing my masters in March. I am coaching volleyball at a high school so very positive things 
-prosecutors office calls me to talk about if I want to discuss the case against the man who manipulated me. My bf didn‚Äôt know about this because it‚Äôs in the past and really didn‚Äôt have a reason to bring it up previously. 
-so now I am just a wreck. I think everything is piling up, having to relive the past traumas and talk about them again. I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶ I am feeling so bitter and upset with everything. When I am having a hard day I just want to feel my emotions and be with people I care about. I have always craved the family structure and want to be involved. I wan that unconditional love. But whenever it‚Äôs a bad day something always comes up with my bf and he just leaves me to do something else. He says I don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù him because I didn‚Äôt die. I don‚Äôt want to be selfish, I understand he has a life outside of me but it‚Äôs so hard for me because I can‚Äôt ask him to drop everything and be there for me but that‚Äôs all I want‚Ä¶ I find myself getting bitter towards him and even his kid because they have so much support and love from their family/families and I see people drop their plans to help them but when I ask I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm selfish‚Ä¶ 

how do you guys deal with these feelings? Do you even have these feelings? 
I hate asking for a pity party but there‚Äôs a lot of times I think about everything that has happened to me and it‚Äôs enough trauma for multiple people‚Ä¶ some stuff people will never experience, and I‚Äôm supposed to just continue on with life and act happy for everyone else?

Lately I got upset a friend group chat I was in had people making sex jokes and I just stormed out. My friend tried to get me back but I was completely fucked up. Idk. I felt so upset and like I was going to cry even though nothing serious happened? It wasn't like anyone was targeting me.

It just feels like everyone is out to hurt me and I'm no good for anything anymore :(

What should I do? I'm so embarrassed I don't even want to talk to my friends anymore cause I'm sure they just want to hurt me anyway and if I was wrong to react like this then I'm stupid and they'll laugh at me.",ptsd
"How do I know if I'm trauma blocking? When I was younger, I know I was molested by my father to a certain degree. I remember some things, but I have an uneasy feeling that there was more I'm not recalling. I feel like there's lots of gaps/things I just don't remember in my childhood not even specifically related to SA, but maybe I just have bad memory. The things I do remember I remember very vividly. But I just feel like there's stuff I'm missing or that I forgot. Can anyone help? And if there are memories that are repressed, will they ever randomly come back or are they lost forever?",ptsd
"Is it normal to not want to get too deep with people in denial of their trauma once you‚Äôve accepted yours?  So I just moved to China and I‚Äôve come to accept my upbringing, which, like‚Ä¶. Is just so bad. It‚Äôs so bad. I won‚Äôt even share it in this post. 

I keep unlocking like new levels ‚Äî remembering things or putting them into context ‚Äî that just leave me like‚Ä¶ damn. The evil I have experienced is actually fascinating tbh. 

I met this girl last night. Most Chinese girls would never just meet a person spontaneously. But she did. And then she told me listens to heavy medal (very frowned upon here; I like metal), and is sexually liberal. We get to talking, and she reveals history of domestic violence, abuse, rape, and other things. 

Also she told me a guy choked her the night before we met, and that said married a local girl 20 years younger than him and swept her off her feet after just a few months. I just told her that she needs to call the police and that this dude is clearly a predator. 

We went home together to my place and we slept in the same bed. She took her clothes off and got close to me, and I just was not into it. I honestly just felt bad for her, like, that she was re-traumatizing herself. Had very poor boundaries. I woke up in a bad mood next to her. 

It‚Äôs making me think a lot of things. Like, I guess I see it as growth. I‚Äôm not into hook ups anymore and I NEED my space. I told her that I just wanted to be alone ‚Äî but then part of me is like‚Ä¶. Am I having an unhealthy fear of intimacy? 

It FEELS natural to me now to not want to involve myself emotionally with people with unresolved trauma. I‚Äôm not saying she gave me bad energy, and I don‚Äôt judge her, but it did feel like her reality is not one I want to step into too deep. This is natural after acceptance, right? 

Any thoughts?

"Should I cut off my narcissistic mother? Ughhhh I am so over my mother and the more I become a nurturing and loving mother to my 2 kids and step daughter who I raise and absolutely adore. I dislike her more and more. I thought having kids would help me understand where she was coming from but it did the opposite. I do not have a bone in my body that would talk to or treat my kids the way she ever did to me and I can't even fathom justifying it. She is also a shitty grandma. I read a quote the other day that said the absent grandparent was probably an absent parent. Pretty much sums it up. Has anyone cut off their narc parent? I used to think it would be extreme but I just want to travel and eat good food with my kids and their dad I a tired of wasting my time on things that do not serve me. For context she is a compulsive liar, uses all our family members for money ( I come form a well off family) to the point they call me looking for her. Everyman she would date she would let them talk to us however they wanted and when I spoke up magically they were broken up. I was in an abusive marriage for 11 years and told no one.

"PTSD ruined me My mother died two days after Christmas 2023 in a pretty traumatic way. She just fell over, and I remember waking up at 4:30 am to my stepdad pleading with me to get over there. The rest was a blur...from running in to see my beloved mom on her floor, to taking over CPR; to watching the light leave her eyes and having to decide it was time to stop because she was already gone, and I was just traumatizing her body. I have a large family, with many siblings, but everything for the funeral basically got put on me which was fine because nobody else knew how to plan a funeral; and I took over as matriarch for the family I didn't know I had antibiotic resistant strep while planning because I was constantly busy making sure her send off was worthy of her (it was), and quite literally almost died myself. The next months were just as awful; my dog passed away a couple months ago from blastomycosis, and she was my emotional support animal, and best friend. My uncle passed after that, and this week alone two of my longtime friends passed within a week of each other. My oldest sister, and my grandparents have no relationship with me any longer because I refuse to put up with their toxic behaviors which is fine with me, but they find a way to disrupt my healing. I was diagnosed with PTSD after my mom died, and my doctor put me on meds to help. They do, but the constant attacks are exhausting. I lost all motivation, and have falling so behind on my bills it's scary...I was a pillar in my community, and now my mind is clouded too much to function properly. Luckily I'm able to work from home mostly, but I haven't been back to work in 9 months physically....I try...I get in my car and I get close to the office, and then I turn around. Panic hits randomly, and I feel like I'm going to die. The depression, and flashbacks are horrible enough. I have to take sleep aids to get any decent sleep. I've gained weight, and my hair in thinner. Therapists are booked months out in my area. I feel so bad on myself because before my mama died I was thriving! I was pulling my kids, and I out of poverty....now I struggle trying to get anything done. Venting here helped, but any ideas on what to do? How do I get back to everything I was ...I feel ruined.....",ptsd
"I'm tired. I got rejected by a girl I liked today. Made me realize where I got cheated out of my childhood, I spent my adolescence trying to recover, and now I'm chasing those teenage experiences I didn't get to experience, like having a first girlfriend.

I'll never get to have a normal life. I'll always be battling these demons and I'll never be truly happy, I didn't get to when I was a child and there's a good chance I won't know, aside from fleeting moments and fantasies that won't come true.

I never got to have a good romance with a woman because I was abused by one when I was a kid, finally opening my heart to one and getting turned down felt like a knife getting put in it. I have nothing to look forward too, I'm a college dropout with a dead end job in a world that'll probably go to complete shit in the next few years, this girl I was talking too was what was keeping me going for a while, but it was just a cope.

"life AFTER PTSD??  I apologise in advance for the length of this but any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated please! 

I‚Äôm finding ‚Äúhealed life‚Äù weirdly difficult (im aware of the paradox there). I would say I‚Äôm mostly healed from C-PTSD/PTSD from shit that happened when i was a teenager (im now 21). I‚Äôve had several rounds of counselling and CBT over the years but I still experience symptoms, just wayyyy less intense. It feels great to have my life back and function relatively normally (as i say, i do still have my moments). 

Early this year I was truly the worst I‚Äôve ever been in my life, even though it was years after the trauma even happened. Whereas now, just mere months later, I feel mostly fine. This wasn‚Äôt linear - it‚Äôs as though it would ‚Äúflare up‚Äù and go away again. But right now, it‚Äôs as if nothing happened, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm finding hard to deal with. 

In truth, I‚Äôm scared to fully move on as I feel like it will invalidate everything that happened. It was bad, but i felt a sense of validation when i was ill. Bad shit happened and i became unwell as a result. But if i‚Äôm healed, who‚Äôs to say the bad stuff was that bad? Rationally, i know thats bullshit but it took me years to come to terms with the fact i was traumatised, and now i‚Äôm struggling to fully move on from it, even though i appear to have healed from it. 

I really am grateful for where i‚Äôm at now. It‚Äôs taken a LOT of work, and i hope i never feel the way i did again. But it‚Äôs left me feeling oddly confused. 

Does it ever fully go? Will i always experience symptoms even though I feel like I‚Äôve processed all there is to process? Is it possible to heal and acknowledge my trauma without feeling the need to justify myself? Is it normal to not be fully 100% healed even after all these years? Do i need help still or do i need to just get a grip? Is it normal for PTSD to resurface even after processing it? ",ptsd
"Living with PTSD is freaking exhausting! I try to put on a brave face as much as I can, I try to fight it with everything in my arsenal, but I'm worried that it's not a fight that I can win. It feels like being in a wrestling match with someone twice my size. I can put up a good fight, but I'm scared that the odds are against me.

Constantly being on alert is exhausting. Thinking what could happen ten steps ahead of what's currently happening is exhausting. Knowing that I could be triggered anywhere at any time scares the snot out of me. Smiling when I'm falling apart is exhausting. Dealing with insensitive comments and pretending not to be affected is exhausting. Waking up from nightmares and going about my day as if I hadn't just relived some of the worst moments of my life is exhausting. Hearing ""at least \_\_\_\_"" even from well-meaning people is exhausting.

""At least you survived."" Yes, I did, thank you very much, but maybe I shouldn't have.

"Extreme Independence is a Trauma Response 
The inability to receive support from others is a trauma response.

Your ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need anyone, I‚Äôll just do it all myself‚Äù conditioning is a survival tactic. And you needed it to shield your heart from abuse, neglect, betrayal, and disappointment from those who could not or would not be there for you.

From the parent who was absent and abandoned you by choice or the parent who was never home from working three jobs to feed and house you.

From the lovers who offered sexual intimacy but never offered a safe haven that honored your heart.

From the friendships and family who ALWAYS took more than they ever gave.

From all the situations when someone told you ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in this together‚Äù or ‚ÄúI got you‚Äù then abandoned you, leaving you to pick up the pieces when shit got real, leaving you to handle your part and their part, too.

From all the lies and all the betrayals.

You learned along the way that you just couldn‚Äôt really trust people. Or that you could trust people, but only up to a certain point.

Extreme-independence IS. A. TRUST. ISSUE.

You learnt: if I don‚Äôt put myself in a situation where I rely on someone, I won‚Äôt have to be disappointed when they don‚Äôt show up for me, or when they drop the ball... because they will ALWAYS drop the ball EVENTUALLY right?

You may even have been intentionally taught this protection strategy by generations of hurt ancestors who came before you. 

Extreme-independence is a preemptive strike against heartbreak.

So, you don‚Äôt trust anyone.

And you don‚Äôt trust yourself, either, to choose people.

To trust is to hope, to trust is to be vulnerable.

‚ÄúNever again,‚Äù you vow.

But no matter how you dress it up and display it proudly to make it seem like this level of independence is what you always wanted to be, in truth it‚Äôs your wounded, scarred, broken heart behind a protective brick wall.

Impenetrable. Nothing gets in. No hurt gets in. But no love gets in either.

Fortresses and armor are for those in battle, or who believe the battle is coming.

It‚Äôs a trauma response.

The good news is trauma that is acknowledged is trauma that can be healed.

You are worthy of having support.
You are worthy of having true partnership.
You are worthy of love.
You are worthy of having your heart held.
You are worthy to be adored.
You are worthy to be cherished.
You are worthy to have someone say, ‚ÄúYou rest. I got this.‚Äù And actually deliver on that promise.
You are worthy to receive.
You are worthy to receive.
You are worthy.

You don‚Äôt have to earn it.
You don‚Äôt have to prove it.
You don‚Äôt have to bargain for it.
You don‚Äôt have to beg for it.

You are worthy.
Worthy.

As of now, only 2 weeks into this investigation with no publicity, there are 4 young boys including myself that we know of that were raped and molested by this man. 

I have on tape his confession to 3 of them. 

The weeks leading up to this moment were rough. The decision to take this step was entirely mine. I'm finally taking back control over the situation. I can't take away the fact that I was abused for many years by him, or take it away for the others. But today... Today I can say I have taken more steps to prevent it from happening to any others. I can take control over my future somewhat. 

Stay strong friends. I wanna thank this community (and others) for the help, advice and understand I've received from many of you, on more than 1 reddit account. (I try to spread it out so that nobody can find it all together and figure out who, what, where to remain anonymous as possible.) 

Much love, guys. ‚ù§Ô∏è",ptsd

"I hate it when people use the word ‚Äútriggered‚Äù to mean ‚Äúupset‚Äù. It‚Äôs been common for a few years now for people to use the word ‚Äútriggered‚Äù online when someone gets upset at something that was posted/said.

It bothers me because I feel it minimizes actual ‚Äútriggers‚Äù.  When I‚Äôm triggered, my body almost goes into shock. I can‚Äôt breathe, my chest hurts, I get dizzy, etc.  

Someone getting angry at someone with a MAGA hat isn‚Äôt triggered. They are angry. 

I wouldn‚Äôt wish PTSD on anyone, but I wish more people understood the gravity of an actual trigger for those of us with PTSD.

EDITED FOR CLARITY : I am referencing when someone says that another person is ‚Äútriggered‚Äù because they got upset or angry. (I‚Äôm my experience only online).

Example: 

Person A: There will never be equality because men are simply superior to women.

Person B: What the fuck is your problem, are you that stupid?  Go back into your hole, incel.

Person A: Oohhh, ‚ÄúPerson A‚Äù is triggered.",ptsd

"As a veteran As a veteran, I just want to say that even if you do didn't serve, I know your PTSD is real.

I question if I had PTSD prior to my military experience. I've had childhood trauma that feel a lot like my combat trauma. I can easily see how the two are similar.

Unfortunately, it's much easier to get taken seriously if you are a Veteran. The VA is very aware of the issue and has plenty of resources. I thank God that I found this path to help me with my mental health struggles.

If you're ever doubting yourself, or finding it hard to find people that relate to you. Just remember at least one person believes you.

Rape jokes really aren‚Äôt funny I was repeatedly raped and physically abused by a romantic partner of mine. It happened almost a year and a half ago and after intensive therapy and medication I finally began to feel like I was regaining my life from my ptsd and that the fog was starting to clear. It‚Äôs been a couple months since I‚Äôve had any intense flashbacks and I honestly didn‚Äôt think there was anything left for me to remember. Earlier tonight I was on a call with a bunch of my brothers friends and one of the guys made a rape joke towards me. I didn‚Äôt think that sort of think would trigger me so bad but I‚Äôve been having panic attacks for the past three hours and I simultaneously feel like I‚Äôm going to puke and pass out. I‚Äôm having intense flashbacks and I can seem to fall asleep for the life of me but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a bad thing because I know that whatever nightmares await will be a lot worse than what I‚Äôm going through now. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to avoid this sort of thing. There‚Äôs no way to really know that someone about to make a rape joke until it‚Äôs too late. It makes me feel so frail and damaged.

"Update: I told my Dad 14F here. So this morning I posted here about whether I should tell my dad about my mom‚Äôs abuse. He didn‚Äôt know because she would only do it when he was at work or deployed. After reading all of the supportive comments and advice, I decided to tell him. Some of you advised that I showed him the post or write a letter, and I decided to do the latter. 

Basically I explained in the letter that she would explode in anger when I did something wrong and briefly described the incidents I talked about in my previous post. I also admitted that the abuse was causing me to be suicidal. I then said I had been scared of telling him because I didn‚Äôt want to cause the end of their marriage and his job, but I needed to tell him because it had been getting worse and worse and I needed help. 

I had the letter written and when my Dad got home from work I asked to talk to him. We went up to my room, he sat on my bed, and I gave him the letter. It‚Äôs hard to describe what I was feeling in that moment. Knowing that our whole lives could change when he read it, for better or worse. I watched his face as he read it and had my hands clasped so tightly together to stop them from shaking that it hurt. His face said a lot. His eyes widened really big, and then he looked really sad. 

When he finally finished the letter, he got up and hugged me. He then started crying. My dad doesn‚Äôt cry often, and I‚Äôve never seen him cry this much. He kept saying how sorry he was. I just stood there let him hug me. The relief I felt that he believed me was immeasurable. When he let go, he held onto my hands and asked if I would be okay up here while he went to talk to my mom. He looked worried, and I was confused at first until I realized he probably asked because I said I was suicidal. I told him I would, and that I wasn‚Äôt actively suicidal. There were just times, usually right after she‚Äôd hurt me, that I felt that way. He looked pretty broken up by that but he nodded and told me to pack some clothes and things because we would likely leave for the night and go to a hotel. 

While I was packing I could hear them. My Mom was denying it at first, but I guess my dad shut that down because then she started crying and screaming about how I was literally useless around the house and would never make it in the world if I didn‚Äôt mature. I should mention that in my 14 years, my dad never once raised his voice at my mom. She was always the yeller of the family, even to him sometimes. But he yelled at her that I was a child not her servant, and that abusing me would not prepare me for adulthood, it would prevent me from getting to adulthood. I got chills when he said that. 

A couple minutes later, he came back up, gave me another hug, and told me we were going to stay at a hotel for the night. I asked if they were getting a divorce, and he said yes, but it wasn‚Äôt because of me. He said he couldn‚Äôt be married to an abuser, and thanked me for telling him. He said he was so sorry that he didn‚Äôt know sooner, and that as soon as things got settled, he would get me therapy because knowing I had ever felt like I wanted to die had scared him a lot, and he wanted to everything he could to help me never feel like that again. 

Aaaand that‚Äôs when I started crying. It was a good few minutes before we actually left. He just held me while I cried out all that stress that had been building. I couldn‚Äôt believe it was really over. I‚Äôm in the car now with him on the way to the hotel. I tried asking about his job and custody but he said that he would worry about all that, but that he would tell me once he got everything sorted out. He also said public school could be scary but nothing like my mom made it out to be (I was homeschooled and she was using the threat of public school as one of the things to keep me from telling him) but that was another thing that would come in time, he said.

Thank you to everyone here who gave me the courage to tell him the truth. Uncertain times are far from over, but I can finally feel safe and protected, and that I‚Äôm not alone. Telling him was probably the hardest but best thing I‚Äôve ever done, and it looks like overall things are looking up. I will never forget the support you all gave me.",ptsd

Others have been through worse.‚Äù The reason why we do this is because it‚Äôs our brain trying to protect itself from potentially more emotional damage but in reality, that‚Äôs exactly what it‚Äôs doing, causing more damage.

"I was raped by a woman - I‚Äôm a man. I feel invisible and invalid. I don‚Äôt want to go in too in-depth, but I was raped via envelopment in 2022 by a woman. 

I said stop multiple times, she got aggressive and essentially pinned me down and continued when I tried to stop her. I didn‚Äôt want to wake her roommate up or make her more mad than she already was. I kinda just gave up and embraced the nauseating pain.

The rape only lasted around 15-30 seconds to maybe a minute, but it felt like an eternity.

I‚Äôve had a very hard time confronting what happened that night. It goes against society‚Äôs view of rape and it took me a long time to even admit that I was raped. I got diagnosed with PTSD, spoke with RAINN‚Äôs chatline and have been in EMDR therapy. I self harmed for the first time in 2023 to cope with the terrible memories.

He has forfeited a high-paying licensed career, almost a decade of life outside prison now, his well-known local reputation, and probably his marriage. And, let's be real: the rest of his future.

And now he has to live out the rest of his life in the wreckage of everything he used to have. Plus 5-10 *extra* years in lockup.

throughout my time on social media i have seen SO many people claim to have ptsd from a significant other cheating, losing a friend due to petty drama, etc. 

i am not trying to invalidate anyone by saying that these experiences aren‚Äôt hard and that they can‚Äôt be traumatic, and i have no problem with people asking about this to genuinely understand the disorder, but by definition in the DSM you do not qualify for a ptsd diagnosis unless you have been ‚Äúexposed to one or more event(s) that involved death or threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or threatened sexual violation,‚Äù by either you directly experiencing it, witnessing it occur to another person, learning of it happening to a close friend or relative, or being repeatedly exposed to details of a distressing event.

do NOT compare me being raped, someone nearly getting killed, or witnessing an act of extreme violence to you having a bad break up. it‚Äôs fucking insensitive, minimizing, and plain disrespectful to everyone with a ptsd diagnosis.

"Warning: ""The Body keeps the score"" is a disrespectful and damaging book on PTSD with wide acclaim So I bought the book ""The body keeps the score"" after it was recommended by a mental health youtuber. And I am disturbed at the cult following this book has gained despite spreading very damaging and false information and views.

I have not read beyond chapter 1 and I don't want to.

&#x200B;

1. Author encourages sympathy for war criminals
2. Author dismisses Vietnamese genocide
3. Author devalues trauma of non-Veteran PTSD victims. This is damaging to the PTSD community as it is a widespread and false stereotype that only Veterans ""deserve"" to claim PTSD. Meaning it goes widely undiagnosed. In reality less than 5% of PTSD sufferers are Veterans. It has taken DECADES to dispell this stereotype and he just reintroduced it. Good job.
4. Author expresses his opinion that the suffering of Veterans is greater than that of rape victims. Which is weird and highly inappropriate for a psychiatrist. It doesn't matter if one persons pain is not as great as another's, they still deserve to seek help. It's made even weirder by how he defends and expresses sympathy for actual rapists. Going as far as saying ""they were traumatised by their own actions"" WTFFFF????
5. That's not trauma, that's guilt. By definition, trauma is something that happens to you, a psychiatrist should know that.
6. Author references the Nazi's but doesn't actually condemn their actions which is suspicious. In fact he seems to be on the wrong side of the Nuremberg trials. While at least the Nazis could claim that they were following orders, the Veterans he defends committed their rape and child murder out of fun
7. He is Dutch, which is where I live. Therefore I know he would have had to read Hannah Arendts ""the banality of evil"" in high school and been exposed to thought experiments and debates on whether following orders counts as warcrime and how much personal responsibility soldiers have since 1st grade. He even grew up during the Nuremberg trial, and claims his father was imprisoned in a concentration camp during WW2. It's not like he is an American who has never been exposed to or had to actually think about these topics. It's like he came up with a strange twisted defence of warcrime to rationalise what happened to his father.
8. The message of the book seems to be ""forgive your rapist, he suffers more from the trauma of your rape than you do""

And don't even get me started on all the scientific inaccuracies and absolute lack of references. All his claims are based on personal experience supported by anecdotes. It referenced discredited techniques, like Rorschach tests, seriously? This book came out in 2016. I legitimately thought this book predates ""Banality of evil"" and the Nuremberg trial considering how immature and underdeveloped his theories are.

Absolute garbage! Hope it gets cancelled before it does more damage to the PTSD community. This is the equivalent of the ""vaccines cause Autism""- paper for PTSD.

EDIT:

Since so many people are trying to gaslight me into denying that what I say actually happens in the book, I wanted to share a quote I found on the goodreads review page of this book, so that you have more than just me as a source that this book is problematic, and that the things I state actually happen in ch1.

"" As a survivor of sexual abuse and trauma, I found this book triggering and lacking the enlightenment I expected, given the reviews. I felt the author showed more compassion for the soldiers who raped and murdered than the rape victims, and the ways in which he discussed the two left me feeling the women weren't as well humanized. Speaking about this with another trauma survivor, she shared that the author was removed from his own trauma center for creating a hostile work environment for women employees.

"Who else is so tired of being in survival mode constantly due to this unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD? Who else is so tired of being in survival mode constantly due to this unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD?

I usually am hypervigilant and quick to advocate for myself as a result of my trauma history--racial, sexual, and emotional abuse. I've spent a lot of my life being gaslighted and mistreated. I have become more confident in standing up for myself, setting boundaries and trusting my intuition these days. I love and respect myself and do not tolerate others who abuse or  disrespect my boundaries. I have always been assertive and have leadership qualities, so this is also part of who I am and who I have to be to survive. 

I want to live in a mental and physical space where I can let down my guard and calm my nervous system so I don't feel the need to put all my energy into advocating and fighting back every time with all my force as if I am dealing with racist, sexist, narcissists or sociopathic abusers everytime. This unsafe world is draining my energy as I frequently have to be in survival mode. When I do let my guard down, I am vulnerable to be attacked or preyed on--recently I have been experiencing racial and sexual harassment. 

((The world is not always unsafe of course, Sometimes there are just miscommunications and people are not out to get me or don't have deceitful intentions due to racism, sexism, etc. I have had to check myself when it was time to let an issue go as I am not able to control everything just myself. There have been times I was embarassed for jumping to conclusions and being overly suspicious and mad when someone was not being deceitful and there was a misunderstanding instead.))

I am working on finding safe physical, mental, and spiritual places where I do not feel the need to protect myself as much and can conserve my energy to heal from cPTSD. I cannot expect to heal as effectively when I am in a place where I keep getting burnt by more abuse. I need to be safe first. It is tough though because as a black mixed woman, there are a lot of places where I am not safe and I have to advocate for myself due to people being out to get me or mistreating me. I cannot wait to move next year to a place where I do feel safer and can let my guard down more and can heal my CPTSD.

Who else is struggling with being in survival mode constantly due to this  unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD history? How are you dealing with it?",ptsd
"It annoys me when trauma survivors say their trauma made them a better and stronger person I've never said this to anyone, especially not trauma survivors, but I dislike the belief that trauma molds people into better, stronger people. I think anyone who experiences trauma has a right to feel stronger, more empathetic, braver, etc. if that is what they feel from their unique experience. But it's okay to not feel that way. It's okay to feel angry, sad, scared, hurt, and any negative feeling that comes from experiencing a traumatic event.

I am a survivor of childhood sexual assault and I f-ing refuse to attribute my positive qualities and achievements to those traumas. Before the traumas I was happy, confident, full of life, trusting. The sexual assaults literally altered my body and brain development. My childhood was hell. It was my inherent strength that got me through, not the events themselves. 

Maybe for some people, their trauma helped them see that they were strong and brave all along, but I already knew that about myself BEFORE it happened. I actually lost confidence in myself for not being able to stop the abuse when I tried. 

I'm not some happy, smiling, cheerleader who says, ""Rape made me better"" because it didn't. Maybe for some people, it does, but not for me.

**ETA: I know why some survivors say their trauma helped them grow to be stronger, more thoughtful, and better people BECAUSE they made themselves learn to cope in healthy and beneficial ways which makes them feel stronger as people. There's nothing wrong with that and that is what I agree with. That is an empowering thing to know YOU got YOU through. Not the adversity, but what you did to face it and overcome it. But some people don't attribute their strengths and positive experiences from the trauma(s) itself and that's okay. Everyone's feelings are valid, but we do not all feel the same and should not be lumped together. Please don't invalidate commenters in this thread for discussing their feelings because it's not easy to talk about this. Thank you**",ptsd
"Annoying trend: Casual use of the term ptsd/triggered in pop culture Not to be that overly offended person, but I feel like I've heard a lot of flippant use of the term PTSD lately. Eg: omg that tik tok was so stupid it gave me PTSD, they changed the formula in my favourite lipstick - now I have PTSD, ugh minions are so annoying they gave me PTSD. 

It just rubs me up the wrong way to hear it used as a joke to replace 'annoyed' or 'shocked' or 'having a tantrum'. 

Don't even get me started on the ""hashtagtriggeredüòã"" stuff.  Like: Oh my god, I hate that girl, I'm so triggered right now #triggeredlol. (I don't mean legit use of triggered, I mean I've seen stupid uses that I feel devalue the actual term and make me hesitant to even use it properly cos I feel stupid saying it.)

Like, occasionally I'll use it meta/ironically in a self deprecating way, to let my partner know I actually am being triggered but don't want to get too emotional about it. I get that being sincere about trauma is hard. But in general, it's just a joke to so many people these days. It grinds my gears üò©


I'm not sure if anyone gets what I mean, but I feel it makes it harder to talk about and even take myself seriously when I'm trying to hard to work through trauma. I know that triggers can be anything, but I'm talking about a specific trend I've noticed when people quite clearly are not actually talking about trauma. Does it bother anyone else? Just me?",ptsd

"I survived a mass shooting 4 weeks ago. I'm an ICU nurse and I can't make it through a full shift without breaking down. I'm afraid and alone and need support Throwaway because these details will make me easily identifiable.

I'm an ICU nurse. Covid came to the states right after I got off orientation at my first ICU job. I was working in an inner city safety net hospital. None of my patients had health insurance- they were all well below the poverty line and unable to afford medical treatment, so by the time they came to the hospital, they were essentially already dead. 100% of our intubated covid patients died. Post mortem care was a daily part of my job for quite a long time. We ran out of body bags. We had to stack bodies in the morgue. Unsurprisingly, I was diagnosed with PTSD. I lost almost all my close friends during covid, either because I didn't have the emotional energy to keep up with them, or because we disagreed about masking/vaccines.

But somehow I managed to carry on... I left that job and worked at another, nicer hospital. Then I left that hospital and recently started a job at an even newer, nicer hospital. I got married. Things were starting to look up for me, but I still felt incredibly fragile emotionally. Every day was hard, but I pushed through in the hopes that things would get better.

Then on the fourth of July, I took my husband to see a parade. He is a foreigner who has never been to a fourth of July parade before, and he was so excited to see this part of American culture.

It was the Highland Park parade. I don't really want to go into detail about it, but I will say we were not even five feet away from some of the victims that didn't make it. We were directly in the line of the gunman's fire. We saw and heard and felt things no human is supposed to experience. Miraculously, we got away completely (physically) unharmed.

I took an unpaid leave of absence from work- they only gave me a week. I'm still on orientation and still in the probationary period, so I didn't qualify for FMLA, short term disability, or any of the other benefits I signed up for. I came back to work after that week and lasted until about 12pm, at which point I had a flashback and had to leave my shift. It was super embarrassing, I was a mess and left the unit in tears. I then had a full blown panic attack in the bathroom and it took 45 minutes to compose myself enough to even leave the hospital.

My manager reached out to me and gave me an additional 2 week (unpaid) leave. I desperately needed every minute of that leave, but I felt no more ready when it came time to go back. I made it through 4 shifts without any hitches or problems. But on my 5th shift- yesterday- I just couldn't cope. I had hardly slept- the nightmares wake me up and keep me up. My brain was foggy and I was missing things, fucking things up, and forgetting things I never have. My preceptor confronted me about it, and I completely broke down. I was physically unable to stop crying. My preceptor and I went into my manager's office. They were supportive and told me I don't need to be embarrassed. They let me go home early. But they did tell me that I need to think long and hard about whether or not I can handle this job right now. They can't give me any more time off, since I'm still in orientation. They want me working there... they need staff, and I have experience which few of the other new hires do. But the implication was basically ""either you need to figure out how to be ok and make it through your shifts, or you can't work here anymore.""

Three of my closest friends have told me that my issues are too much for them to deal with and they're not in a place themselves to emotionally support me right now. One friend even said that my texts were ""triggering"" for her and that she didn't want to contact me at all. We'd been friends for 24 years. She's blocked my number now. We were already on rocky terms because we argued about covid, but I thought she'd be willing to put our differences aside in this situation. Guess not.

I have a therapist, a really good one, but it's not enough. the amount of support I need is not support that one sole person can provide. I'm terrified of opening up to my husband in fear that I'll burn him out too... losing a friendship after 24 years has destroyed my sense of trust and my belief that unconditional love exists. My problems have already been ""too much to handle"" for three friends. I feel my trauma has turned me into an emotional vampire and the last thing I want to do is cause my husband- who went through this trauma too- more pain. I don't just ""feel like a burden"", I *am* a burden and have explicitly been told by some of the people closest to me that I'm a burden.

My support system is pretty much just my husband and my therapist right now, and it's just not cutting it. I called a crisis support line today. It was essentially 15 minutes of me hysterically crying. Then the crisis counsellor told me she had to leave. She established I wasn't going to kill myself, and hung up. In my head, I'm thinking to myself, ""Great. Scared another one away.""

I don't know what to do. I don't feel like another job would be any easier for me than this one, so quitting this job and finding another doesn't feel like much of a solution. And I need to work- I'm sponsoring my husband's green card. I worked so hard to get to where I am career wise and I don't want a mass shooter to take that from me.

I don't even know what I'm asking for. I'll take advice, or even just acknowledgement. If you've read this far, thank you. I just needed to be heard and I didn't know where else to turn.",ptsd
YOUR TRAUMA WAS BAD ENOUGH! ,ptsd
"I am so tired of how people throw around terms like ""traumatized"" or ""PTSD"" like it's nothing these days. I wanna make something very clear I am not talking about anyone here. I am talking about how in places like Tik Tok, Instagram, X etc people will use these terms to describe literally the most trivial problems or experiences. They have no idea how crippling PTSD is. PTSD has ruled and destroyed my life. I am extremely isolated, I have never had a girlfriend, and I can't hold a job for more than a few months since I was sexually abused as a boy. This disorder is like a cancer for me. There is nothing romantic or trivial about it. And when people mis use those terms it's so good damn insensitive because they have no idea how much suffering is involved. ",ptsd
"My son has PTSD I‚Äôm a single father and my son (13) watched his mom die. It was so quick, we didn‚Äôt think anything was wrong with her, she just collapsed when I was at work. 

It‚Äôs been a few months and he wakes up screaming frequently. Like vocal cord ripping level screams. It takes forever to get him to calm down,afterwards I‚Äôll carry him to my room. It‚Äôs horrible. He stays around me and often snuggles with me, I think he‚Äôs afraid of losing me. 

He has quick mood changes and blames himself for it. No matter how many time I tell him now one is to blame he never listens. He‚Äôs in therapy. 

Just wanted a small vent. It‚Äôs breaking me seeing him like this. I love him so much.",ptsd
"r/ptsd is not the place to get your diagnosis I‚Äôve noticed recently that there seem to be a lot of posts where people are asking if they have PTSD.

"DAE feel like their brain is ""broken"" from long-term trauma exposure? I'm really starting to see how all those years are affecting me, and I feel like I can't live a normal life after it.

"My boyfriend died in my arms yesterday I woke up just like any other day, I turned around to wake him up and he had significant amounts of blood coming out his nose and his body was stiff and he was completely unresponsive. It was all a blur but I tried to resuscitate him after calling 911 but he had already passed. They don‚Äôt know the cause of death yet. I laid with him on the ground and snuggled with him one last time before the coroner arrived. I can‚Äôt eat or sleep. I‚Äôm taking Xanax from the panic attacks. 

All I can think about is his body laying on the floor, completely flushed, and half his face swollen. It was the most horrifying thing I had ever seen and it flashes through my thoughts non stop. He visited me in my dreams last night and said ‚Äúeverything is going to be okay‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt feel okay, I just need him back with me.

I fight my triggers, issues daily to just have some semblance if normalcy and peace.  There is a bad enough stigma with it and now  our pain and mental health get trivialized by society who have no idea what we go through.",ptsd
"I feel like no one talks about how you never will feel normal again after the trauma Like even on the good days when my ptsd isn‚Äôt acting up that much I still don‚Äôt feel normal.

"Shoutout to all of the people with PTSD that have horrible memories My memory has been deteriorating a lot over the last few months, and I recently learned that it probably stems from trauma. Apparently PTSD can wreak long-term havoc on the brain (which makes sense, I just hadn‚Äôt thought about it before) and has a particularly nasty effect on the hippocampus.

I‚Äôm young, maybe younger than most people on the sub, and memory loss has always been one of my biggest fears. So to learn that PTSD can permanently effect my memory and double my chance of developing dementia later on, is taking a toll on me. 

If anyone else has been affected like this, hi, you‚Äôre not alone. Shit sucks but we‚Äôll all get through it.

Edit: I didn't expect this to even hit Hot, but I'm so glad so many of us can relate, and all in different stages of it.

"r/ptsd will not be joining the blackout Thank you to those who expressed their concerns and voted in the poll this weekend.    While there was slightly more votes (only about 20) for joining the blackout, the difference was minimal, and important points were raised why we shouldn't join the blackout.

Therefore, the mods of r/ptsd have made the decision not to close or restrict r/ptsd during the protest of the API changes from 12th to 14th of June.  Anything can happen in 48 hours, and for those who may need support most, we don't want to take this platform from them.  Unlike what reddit is doing to people with disabilities.

We do however still support other subreddits going dark temporarily and permanently, and the mods will be individually participing in the protest in other ways.  We invite you to find ways to protest (respectfully) as well.  What reddit is doing is not acceptable and will have detremental effects to the platform.

"Feeling trapped, rapist is getting more famous and I‚Äôm struggling to avoid his face I am struggling a bit this week and trying to mentally prepare for the next few months. My rapist has gotten a little famous over time. He is a political commentator so his profile tends to somehow make it into my news feed/facebook/tik tok even though I avoid politics, blocked him on tik tok, etc. I block and avoid these things to avoid seeing him. The tik tok I saw yesterday he had over 500,000 likes and it‚Äôs concerning me he‚Äôs getting more famous which means his face will be tormenting me more often. My close friend who I was living with posted him on instagram and when I asked her to take it down in a panic she told me how she thinks he‚Äôs so funny. I previously reported him to the police and then again to the FBI. I just don‚Äôt want to live like this, it‚Äôs so stressful for me. He was my first experience and it was particularly prolonged and violent so it had a huge negative impact on my life and the PTSD was all encompassing.

i get it‚Äôs public information and people are more curious about the taboo.. i don‚Äôt mean to react out of emotion and pain. 
it just hurt so much, they didn‚Äôt ask for permission, NO notification.. just made a multiple part podcast ‚Ä¶ years later.. and it gained enough traction to be sent to my parents and I.. and it really triggered me more than I thought it would and felt blindsiding
and as a younger person- I understood that these podcasts ( even if my sensitivity doesn‚Äôt understand the enjoyment) are a thing and there is a huge market.. but I had to explain to my older parents first- what a podcast is, but also how they could be allowed to do this? 
It just hurts so bad. They don‚Äôt know rlly how to use their phones , so luckily they can‚Äôt play it / fully navigate the site , so I am the one emailing and there was crime scene photos on the website without warning. 
And then, I‚Äôm an idiot so I listened. 
It started with an upbeat plug for their merch :D, light banter and even a moment where they described elements of his death ‚Äúfascinating‚Äù‚Ä¶

And it‚Äôs such a heavy topic, so I don‚Äôt know how to talk about it. I have work tomorrow and I just idk it all feels like so much 

If you read this much, thank you
also- is there a support group for that kind of situation ?

Edit; thank you all so so much for the acceptance, resources and just respect. it means so much..
i do not intend on taking legal action or anything - just rather contact to see if they tried to reach out to us - and then maybe ask them to at least take the crime photos off the website - because it‚Äôs one thing for me to have clicked the podcast.. that was my choice.. but the photos on the site is excessive.",ptsd

"The person who sexually abused me was denied parole with no chance for another hearing! The hearing was today. I didn't go but the victims services advocate I've been talking to emailed me about it. I didn't end up writing an impact statement. I tried but it was too triggering so I let the advocate know that and she asked for my permission to tell the parole board that I was too triggered to write an impact statement because that alone gives an idea of the impact. So I told her to tell them and that I also thought they should know that I've been diagnosed with PTSD and I'm in therapy and on antidepressants and anxiety medication and medical marijuana for it.
The email said: ""The reasons for the denial are: nature and circumstances of the offense, injury and impact to the victim‚Äôs and inadequate institutional program participation.""
I replied to ask her when he'd be up for parole again and she said: ""He won‚Äôt be.¬† The board denied him with no chance for a re-hear.¬† There are other means of release thru the department of corrections, please be sure to keep your registration current so that if he applies you will be notified.""
I'm so relieved. 
And he didn't even get to leave prison to go to the courthouse. They did a video conference from the prison.  And no one showed up in support of him or even to do an impact statement. No one he knew cares about him anymore. There's no one who wants him released. He has nothing and no one and I'm glad.
Even if he does get out, there's at least 7 men in my family who own guns and want to shoot him and he's well aware of that so he'd probably stay away. I found out recently that when he was first questioned after I reported the abuse, he asked the police to protect him from my father. He's a pathetic bastard.",ptsd

For example I saw someone describe an incident where their friend read their journal too their crush in 7th grade as ""traumatizing"" like...genuinely they believe they have trauma from this. It's really insulting and frusterating you know? Like yeah that would be VERY embarrassing and mortifying but like C'mon. You're an adult now, build a bridge and get over it. There's ""Don't compare your trauma to others,"" and then there's shit like that. It just irks me when people act like every tiny hardship in their life is ~trauma~. No. You don't know what that word means. That word actually means something to people and to mental health professionals.

I also hate how terms like ""disassociate"" or ""intrusive thoughts"" became a quickly personality trait and then memes. Because even though my psychologist has identified these for me and said that what I'm experiencing, I still don't like to say that's what I'm experiencing. Like I feel like I'm making it up to be quirky or be funny or some shit. But it's not...I will struggle with talking to my therapist about having trouble with intrusive thoughts or not knowing where I was the last 4 fucking hours because I got triggered and disassociated. It's not fun. It just makes me feel stupid. I'm sick of my mental illness and trauma being the trendy personality trait of the year.

"I wish people understood the way triggers work Although lots of my triggers are very reasonably ‚Äúscary‚Äù things, lots of them are also seemingly innocent or harmless. I don‚Äôt really talk about my PTSD but the few times I commented on something being ‚Äútriggering‚Äù, I got laughed at. I wish people understood that I‚Äôm not traumatized by something ‚Äúsilly‚Äù; rather, that thing is somehow a reminder of a much much uglier part.

Just because something is a trigger, doesn‚Äôt mean that particular thing gave me PTSD. I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù that got traumatized by something so trivial, ANYTHING can be a trigger. A word, a smell, a picture, a concept, literally anything. Even a puppy can be a trigger. A trigger doesn‚Äôt have to be something blatantly ugly. 

It seems like people confuse the trauma with the things that trigger it, such as flashbacks and what not. They‚Äôre nowhere near the same thing. If someone drops a pen, and they have a full blown episode over it, it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre literally afraid of dropping pens. It‚Äôs just a reminder of something much much more sinister that happened to them.

"The word ""trigger"" It really irritates me that the word ""trigger"" or ""triggered"" has been turned into a joke and a meme and people just casually throw it around whenever something is mildly inconvenient.
Then when I try to explain to people what my triggers are, they treat it as if I'm just being overdramatic because of the contexts in which they normally see the word.
It makes me feel self-conscious about asking someone not to do something because it's triggering since I worry that people who don't know what I have been through will assume I'm just an overly sensitive person who needs to ""get over it""",ptsd

"My dog saved my life today TW talk of suicide


I had written a note, made plans, I woke up sobbing this morning and just couldn't bear it any more, i was just so overwhelmed. And she just kept bumping me with her nose and getting me to look at her and trying to lick my tears away. Eventually I decided if I was going to do it, I would need to set her up to be more comfortable for the day (its really hot here) and got up and moved to go and set her up her bed and food in a different cooler part of the house. Moving helped a little bit, but I was still in that headspace. She wouldn't settle until I came and sat on the sofa with her, and she just laid out staring at me. Something about the look I her eyes was just so innocent and pure and it set me off crying and sobbing again, the idea that she wouldn't know what had happened to me if I killed myself. I decided to take a nap, I figured if I was going to do it anyway then who cares of I slept till 3pm anyway first. I woke up calmer. Sure the whole day was wasted sleeping but i woke up at the end of it...I came down from bed and sat with her on the sofa after and I don't know... I just really think if she hadn't have been here I would have done something to myself.

"PTSD is NOT a mental disorder. It's a mental injury. It just isn't. It flat out isn't a disorder, at least not to me. It's a mental injury. A mental scarring, a wound that is having such a hard time closing. There's actually people advocating out there for the name to be changed. I think PTSD can attribute to the development of mental disorders, but to me PTSD in and of itself is an injury. Also part of ptsd being a mental injury is the fact that it can be healed, treated and alot of times fully cured. Its been shown time and time again to be highly treatable just through therapies alone and in some cases goes away on its own with no intervention. Also mind the fact, regardless of the behaviors it causes, PTSD has actuay been shown to still be a normal trauma response.",ptsd

"PTSD education should really be more of a thing For background I am a survivor of the Route 91 shooting in Las Vegas.

My family does not understand PTSD. Most if them don't believe it is a real thing. This morning my Uncle felt the need to send me footage from a shooting that happened at their local hardware store yesterday. ""You used to work in a hardware store. I thought you should see this. A shooting happened at our hardware store the other day""

I have not opened the link. Maybe it is totally benign and wouldn't bother me at all. Or maybe I'll open it and the anxiety will ensue. I would rather not find out.

I do not expect everybody in my life to cater to my needs or walk on eggshells because of my PTSD. I do, however, expect someone like my Uncle to use common sense and not send me something that obviously hits way too close to home.

"Does anyone else mourn the child they could have been? I mourn about my younger self. I was 5 years old when I was woken up in the middle of the night to my uncle sexually assaulting me.

I enjoyed those nights up until the night I woke up to that... I'm pretty sure it wasn't only one time. ""What's happening?"" ""Shhh go to sleep, it's only a dream"". That's around the time my sleeping habits became nightmare after nightmare.

Sadly that wasn't my only trauma as a kid so I began to lose a lot of sleep throughout the years, getting so anxious, angry, depressed. I didn't understand at the time.

"Is it common to downplay or even question your trauma? To feel that your pain isn‚Äôt valid, that you‚Äôre making it up, that you have no right to suffer because of it?

I spent most of my childhood being the protector of my younger brother.

Anyway, I‚Äôve had anxiety and depression my whole life (as far back as I can remember), but this past year it has been particularly bad. Inpatient stays, outpatient, therapy, etc. A few weeks ago, I started having flashbacks, and my mind just can‚Äôt stop thinking of the things that happened. 

I‚Äôve been angry. At first, it was towards my mom, but lately I just feel angry at myself. I think things like, ‚Äúdid this even happen? why am I making such a big deal out of this?

Do people assume you‚Äôre ‚Äúdumb‚Äù or ‚Äúslow‚Äù because of trauma symptoms?

I‚Äôve been called slow and dumb my whole life. A lot of people think I am ditzy and an airhead. Often I‚Äôm not aware what is going on in the present moment because I am in my head (anxiety, dissociation, ruminating thoughts). I often will have slow responses to people because I am emotionally dysregulated, I was distracting myself and/or hypervigilant as I try to read the person/situation (I try to figure out if I am safe and can trust them). When I get dysregulated, I often freeze and forget what I am doing. I know my cPTSD symptoms are a big reason I appear ‚Äúslow‚Äù because when I take a mood stabler, a lot of those symptoms go away. I also I wonder if having cPTSD for so long had changed my brain so I am slower and have a slower processing speed.
It bothers me a lot when I get patronized and treated like I‚Äôm slow/dumb. Sometimes people think I am lying when I say I went to graduate school. Also, sometimes I attract manipulative, insecure and sexist men who like to feel like they are superior and try to infantilize me because they think I‚Äôm

"I don't like them taking away the word ""victim"". There's a real push in PC culture right now for not just people with PTSD but rape and abuse victims also to not call themselves ""victim"" but rather ""survivor"". The problem with that is, I WAS victimized. That kind of language benefits the people who harm us, because if they see us as ""survivors"" than they can go on abusing us and it's like it doesn't matter. You can do anything to a ""survivor"". Also, it shames people coming forward because the word ""victim"" has become negative and shameful. I think instead of replacing ""victim"" with another word, we should be making it so that ""victim"" is not a shameful thing to be. You hear whining mostly on the right, mostly aimed at women, about people, mostly women, accused of ""playing the victim"". The solution to that isn't to call yourself something else, but to assert that yes, I am a victim, but no I am not playing or pretending. This all actually happened to me. If I were a ""survivor"" I feel like that just makes me violable because I'm then expected to be ""tough enough"" to ""handle it"". It puts pressure on victims by telling US to get over it and cope and be strong, rather than pressuring abusers to change THEIR shitty patterns of behavior. I understand that individual people might like feeling like a ""survivor"", but I feel like the label is toxic because it's telling the victims how to approach handling being victimized. I do want to be a victim, because I was one, and fuck anyone telling me what to call myself. 

This was also brought up in the second season of *Thirteen Reasons Why*, and I thought, like many mental health issues in that show, that it was handled in such a garbage way. Basically, a main character was raped while under the influence of alcohol at a party. She has a hard time getting over it. A feminist in charge of a ""rape survivors"" group tells her to join them ""when you're ready to stop being a victim and start being a survivor"". In other words, her shaming the character into being the right kind of ""strong survivor"" type of person, and being sad was seen as weak. She was also shaming her into going forward with legal action against her rapist. The show acted like it was important that she do that, no sympathy for victims who do not report. I feel like this is reflective of larger problems with society wanting everyone to always project an aura of strength and confidence, where we bully, ridicule, and shame people for being weak or emotionally damaged.",ptsd

"Am I a Karen for being a little bothered when people without PTSD joke about having it?

For example, if my friend opened a new bag of chips and it exploded everywhere they might say the next time they open a bag ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be so careful this time I have PTSD from the last time it exploded‚Äù.

I just wish people would be a little more aware of what they‚Äôre saying around certain people. I don‚Äôt feel personally offended, I know they aren‚Äôt trying to poke at me, but it does make me feel a little invalidated. It makes me wonder if they think it‚Äôs something silly to joke about and not something that totally fucked me up. Thoughts?? Am I being too sensitive?? Again this only about people who literally do know I have PTSD.

Thank you all for being respectful in the comments, regardless of your opinion.

Like totally disregarding the actual question I asked and making it into a space to bash and invalidate and make a mockery of PTSD. like insinuating that it isn‚Äôt even a real disorder (wtfffff).  Basically telling me that I have to deal with whatever people say or call me because of ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù. I ended up taking it down and just keeping the post up here because of it. It didn‚Äôt bother me that people were saying I was in the wrong, but the hurtful and arrogant comments were ridiculous. Just goes to show that most people have no idea what PTSD is. They think it‚Äôs about as big as someone going to war and being scared of fireworks after. Which everyone in this subreddit can vouch could not be further from the reality we live every day. It makes me really sad that people aren‚Äôt only uneducated on the topic, but unwilling to learn. PTSD is such a heavy and all consuming disorder, and it‚Äôs constantly shit on. I wish there were more organizations or promo of PTSD awareness. I felt so alone and overwhelmed until I started reading these comments. People who are educated on the topic, whether they think I‚Äôm being over sensitive or if they agree with me, are still respecting my trauma and not bashing my mental illness.

"Does anyone else get ""imposter syndrome"" with their ptsd? I put imposter syndrome in quotes because im using it for lack of a better phrase. 

I don't know if it's because I've always been extremely uncomfortable with expressing emotions/witnessing displays of emotion, but when I have a a flashback or an episode I feel like I'm being really overdramatic. Like I'm being very performative and I have this voice in my head telling me that I'm being way too dramatic, to reign it in and that I'm obviously just faking it for attention. This also come along with me downplaying things which is a coping mechanism of mine. Like telling myself my trauma ""isn't even that bad"" or that it doesn't warrant PTSD etc. 


Now I can rationalise these thoughts because my physical symptoms aren't fake. I can't stop the shaking and the hyperventilating. I also hate attention/being fussed over, if anything I get extremely embarrassed. But I was wondering if this is a typical thing?

"Sad knowing so many people in Ukraine will be struggling with PTSD, with very little mental health support, if any at all. Just knowing how hard PTSD is, but whilst still being in an active war zone must be a whole different story.

"I identify more with 'victim' than with 'survivor' Last year I was having some counselling sessions for my trauma while waiting for help from mental health services, and my counsellor was totally baffled when I said that I identified more with the word victim than the word survivor. She asked, isn't survivor more empowering?

For some people it is, but not for me. I'm not a survivor,  I wasn't struck by lightning, I didn't have cancer, I didn't 'survive' a random event. I'm a victim, not because I'm weak or belittled, but because this was *done to me by another person.* My trauma was a deliberate act done to me by someone else, they deliberately victimised me, and I need to process it as such. 

The word 'victim' has such horrifying stigma, and - don't get me wrong - replacing it with 'survivor' is crucial to other PTSD sufferers' self-definition. But for me it has never sat right. There's an assumption even in trauma services that calling yourself a victim is limiting yourself, or not being strong, having the tendency to see yourself as weak, or not acknowledging how you've powered through it all. Often it's the idea that once you see yourself as a victim or 'victimise yourself' you become pathetic, oversensitive, overreactive, less capable, less than. But I'm none of those things.

I can't process my trauma without accepting and being vocal about its origins. I didn't 'survive' this, because it isn't over. But accepting that I was someone's victim doesn't mean I'm all of the negative connotations of 'victim'.",ptsd
"PTSD is such BS Seriously.

"People have such burning hatred for poor people, and it's extremely..... upsetting I suffer from PTSD from mutiple different things in my life, but one of the most intense and horrifying to remember is when I was homeless for a year. 

In America at least (though Im sure in other places as well), once you become homeless or in poverty, you're no longer a part of ""society"". You're not a ""member of society"", you're a Burden. A 'leech', for needing anything, anything at all, even something as small as a listening ear or breadcrumb. It's an offense to even suggest you may need help, to suggest that anyone should even consider helping you. Because in their eyes, you must have done something to ""deserve"" poverty, or homeless. It's like a moral branding to them. It doesn't matter how you became severely poor/homeless, and it doesnt matter how desperately you're fighting to survive/escape your circumstances. ""Poor/homeless"" is all they need to know to ""know"" that you're unworthy of help, or of compassion. You're the scum beneath their feet. You're not even human.

Even after being homeless and tormented for a year, and then in poverty for 4, I still feel myself become crushed under the weight of people's disgust for poor/homeless people. It utterly shocks me. It steals the breath from my lungs. 

The internet is full of cruelty and anger, obviously, but..... it's not just on the internet, anyways, not by a longshot. People are not shy about their disgust for poor people, and if you haven't been in extreme poverty you may not have even noticed how bad it is. You may have some deeply rooted hatred and judgement inside you, too. 

It's. horrifying. And it brings me back to the most horrifying days/experiences of my life. I think i had a conclusion to this, but i feel like a child again, starving and absolitely terrified and being proven to that even the mostly seemly compassionate or kind people will turn on you the moment you have no money. The moment you become """"worthless"""". 

Here's a conclusion i guess,,, Anyone else traumatized by poverty/homelessness, or more specifically, how people treated you because you were in poverty/homeless",ptsd
"My patient died a violent death and I think I have PTSD from it Tldr: He suffered a cardiac tamponade that led to sudden onset hypotension, and his IV got pulled out, which led to hypovolemic shock.

The patient had come to the hospital, complaining of severe chest pain and weakness, and had said he suffered clots before, so he was given blood thinners to treat it. Around 12:50 AM i got a call from his room. It was his wife, screaming about excessive bleeding and her husband throwing up. 

I stepped into his room, and it was like a scene straight out of a horror movie. I truly do not mean to crassly compare it to something like but I have no idea how else to express it. As soon as I stepped into his room I went into instant panic mode because of what I saw. I froze up. My mind went blank.

His bed was so saturated in blood  that it went through all of his linens and was covering the mattress. His blankets were so soaked that it was dripping on to the floor. His gown was completely black because he was so bleeding out so much. His IV had been torn out of his arm and he was just pouring blood everywhere.

I tried so hard to stop it. The floor was slick with his blood that I fell and nearly split my own head open trying to get to the emergency staff button. I tried so hard. The towels. The gauze. There just so much bleeding that it went through everything.

His face turned so white. I had never seen anything so terrifying in my life. All i can see when I close my eyes is the color draining from his face.

His blood pressure went from 127/79 to 42/30. He was dead at 1:35 AM.

I don't know what to do. I've changed my clothes. I've written this out. I cried. But all I can think of is all that blood. His dying face. He was shaking so much.

He came in and was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism when he had a cardiac tamponade and we gave him blood thinners for a clot that didn't exist.

I can't help but think we killed him. I can't stop thinking what if I had gotten there a few minutes earlier? What if I hadn't froze at the door? Maybe I could have prevented his IV from being ripped out. Maybe I could hace saved his life. My mind is tearing itself apart. I feel sick thinking about it. I had his blood running down my arms. The sound of his,wife screaming at me to stop his bleeding.

I don't know how to deal with this. I'm shaking, and all I can think about is his face and all that blood. I can't sleep. I can't think about anything else.",ptsd

"PTSD: A condition that has to be ‚Äúbelieved‚Äù Wow. I‚Äôm just realizing that there are conditions people suffer from that are mostly indisputable, like, a broken leg for example, or a knife wound.

But with PTSD, the burden of proof is usually on us. And often, despite providing overwhelming evidence, it‚Äôs still not always believed that we have it. 

And on top of all of that, the more people do not believe in our symptoms the more we are likely to question them ourselves. Which is almost even more tragic. That we can inhabit a body that is clearly reacting to the environment in a way that can be disabling for us, and yet we can sometimes question even our own sanity‚Ä¶",ptsd

I feel happy, healthy, and satisfied with my life currently. I've never felt better but sometimes I randomly get overwhelmingly sad or have a rush of emotions about an event that happened in the past. I'll get sucked into a memory but it's more centered on the emotions I probably should've felt during the time than the actual event. I refer to them as emotional flashbacks but I'm not sure if that's the correct term or if there's even a term for it. I'll cry and cry. It can be debilitating but then once I'm done crying, it just disappears. I know it's probably repressed trauma I need to work through but I don't know how. It's like I've repressed it so much that I'm unaware of it until it's crushing me and then once it's gone, it's gone. I can't work on it cause I can't normally recognize it. Is this normal?

Healing from PTSD has been the hardest but most important job I've ever had! I am so glad my real job is so low key that I am able to have more time to take care of myself.

There is a lot of crucial energy and time spent trying to heal from trauma such as processing the emotions from trauma during hard dreams/ triggers/flashbacks, educating myself about the abuse, the self care, mental health care, leaving toxic relationships, isolating, learning and setting boundaries, self parenting, etc ..

This hard work is paying off and I am so proud of myself and glad I love and care about myself enough to do it. I will never give up on myself, I am my number one advocate and supporter.

There is a person lurking this sub who has gone by previous usernames such as ‚Äúcoder‚Äù and ‚Äúisusha‚Äù. They started by messaging me with something along the lines of ‚Äúhey I saw your post on X and I was hoping I could just vent to you. Awaiting your reply‚Äù 

They say they are a minor being abused. When you engage them they are extremely insistent on NOT calling CPS or the cops. They say they just want to vent and they eventually just want to describe the abuse to you. 

I didn‚Äôt report it immediately because i was worried it might be an actual confused child :(
But another user messaged me the other day saying she had received the exact same kind of messages from ‚Äúcoder‚Äù (his old username). 

I think it‚Äôs safe to say this person is going to a lot of these subs and messaging people. Since they have created new usernames and deleted old ones I also think it‚Äôs safe to say they will continue this behavior. 

I‚Äôm sure there are other people like this lurking as well. I just wanted to share this persons particular narrative and method to help you guys identify them if they try writing you from a new username. 

Stay safe everyone. I know this sucks but we are adults now who can make safe choices and I am trying to see this as an opportunity to practice setting boundaries, and standing up to creeps.

"I just found out my father is a narcissistic pedophile. Welp.

We went to therapy and I had suspected the truth but I could not believe it until I had confirmation. My brothers abuse has been hid from everyone in his life including his wife.

"I was stabbed 18 times and pushed off a cliff, and that was the easy part I was attacked while hiking in Honolulu in 2009. An individual had a psychotic break and thought Japanese men wearing blue were government agents sent to kill him. I was stabbed 18 times, mostly in the head and throat, and pushed off the top of Koko Crater. I fell 100 feet. I broke my neck, fractured my skull, both my lungs collapsed, my left lung was punctured, my liver and diaphragm were stabbed, an artery in my temple was severed.
I lost 5 pints of blood. I was lucky to survive, there have been a few challenges along the way. 

I was rear-ended twice while recovering from the broken neck. I was betrayed by the justice system. My attacker was acquitted due to temporary insanity and was put in a mental hospital.
Just 3 years after trying to murder 2 people, he was granted permission to take college courses at a nearby community college unescorted.
He was released in 2018 and gets free healthcare for life. 

In 2021, I was diagnosed with lipodystrophy, a rare metabolic disorder that causes complete fat loss.
Every ounce of fat disappears and your organs slowly shut down. I haven‚Äôt laid on my back in 2 years and I haven‚Äôt sat voluntarily in 2 years because my butt fat is gone. Most of my life is spent laying on my stomach. 

It won‚Äôt surprise you that I have PTSD, what might surprise you is that the trauma from my stabbing is a drop in the bucket compared to the trauma of chronic illness. I survived and even overcame maybe the most violent attempted murder ever committed, and yet I‚Äôm taken down by a rare metabolic disorder. Life without fat is exponentially more painful than getting stabbed and pushed off a cliff. Crazy, right? 

People ask how I‚Äôve survived all this trauma. The answer is simple: I‚Äôm half Japanese and half  Scandinavian. That means I‚Äôm a samurai AND Viking. It‚Äôs hard to kill one, but I‚Äôm both! 

This is a challenging situation and I worry about the future, but I post this to remind you of the strength of the human spirit. I hope this part inspires you: that lunatic tried to stab my brain 6 times. What did I do with that brain? I went back to school and I graduated with a 4.0 and $90,000 in scholarships. I became a published author and wrote and spoke about my survival throughout Hawaii and California. I knit thousands of scarves, beanies, and potholders and sold them to pay for medical bills. I fought for victim‚Äôs rights, and I supported victims and survivors through their trials. I did all these things with PTSD, OCD, anxiety, and severe chronic pain.

"Abuse victims with PTSD, have you guys also noticed how abuse is used for comedy in media? It's kinda painful to see what causes me so much heartache used in comic relief. I've mostly seen this with emotional and physical abuse. For example, i remember seeing good luck Charlie as a kid and seeing how neglected Gabe was. He was the 3rd out of 5 siblings, but the parents treat the other 4 kids with more love and attention than him. Causing him to act out and be a delinquent. (And Disney loves to copy this dynamic into other shows)
A more recent example I've seen is in my favorite game Persona 5 the Royal, the character Ryuji had already been physically abused by his dad and coach, then his friends casually called him ""stupid"" and beat up on him. There's even a controversial scene in the original Persona 5 where Ryuji is implied to get assaulted by two stereotypical gay men. And this isn't the first example of a character abused for comedy in the history of Atlus games.
As a domestic violence victim who's abuse was treated as comedy or punishment in real life, it brings me back to a time where my pain was used as a punchline. My abuser and his friend thought it was funny when I got upset in response to abuse. Im not trying to be some tumblrina complaining, im trying to explain that abuse isnt funny and shouldn't be treated as such.",ptsd
"""The Body Keeps the Score"" is probably the most comprehensive and easiest to read book on PTSD I've posted about this book before on /r/ptsd , but it helped me so much, I think it bears reposting. The book came out in 2015, so its relatively new. It was written by a psychologist who attempted to treat PTSD in Vietnam Veterans in the early 1970s and has been trying to understand trauma of all forms for his entire career. It is written partly as a description of his career and the technological developments that helped doctors understand trauma, but it also goes into great detail describing the physical mechanisms of trauma and how to overcome them. And yes, you can overcome them.

I have PTSD from a near death experience that landed me in a 9 day medically induced coma. In trying to recover, I kept meeting people talking about 'energy' or memories living in our muscles and it just always felt confusing or vague and even more disempowering. This book REALLY demystified a lot of these concepts for me and helped me believe for the first time that not only were my problems understandable, but that there were practical things that I could do to move beyond them.",ptsd
"A therapist isn‚Äôt necessarily dismissing your trauma by not giving you a PTSD diagnosis  Several times a week I see a post stating that someone‚Äôs therapist has decided not to give them a diagnosis for PTSD for xyz reason. The conclusion many people come to is that the therapist is dismissing their trauma, they are a bad therapist, or that they are simply uninformed. 

While it is incredibly important to advocate for yourself, we are also not entitled to a diagnosis simply because we think we have it. There are so many differential diagnoses that carry similar symptoms to PTSD and are trauma related disorders that may be a better fit. You may also have gone through a trauma, have symptoms, but not quite meet the criteria for PTSD. 


I urge people to really consider how they feel about their therapist overall and how they respond to their pain when it‚Äôs brought up in session. Recognize a pattern of dismissing and go from there. 

And it‚Äôs worth considering in the comments section that more harm then good can come from telling people whom you don‚Äôt know that their therapist is awful and dismissing them without a fair amount of evidence for it. Because if that‚Äôs not true, the person will carry the belief that yet another person doesn‚Äôt care about them or their trauma. Even if the therapist does care and is still working through the trauma and symptoms of it. 

Of course, advocate for yourself, seek a second opinion if needed. Always be aware if a therapist IS dismissing you. But please recognize a therapist‚Äôs job is to decipher all your symptoms and give you a diagnosis that‚Äôs the best fit. And sometimes, it may not be the diagnosis you think you have or are wanting to have. ",ptsd

edit: i see some people misinterpreting my point so i‚Äôll say again that i‚Äôm not implying that weed or other substances don‚Äôt help people, it‚Äôs just hurtful when people refuse to take no for answer and try to pressure you to do it, whether that‚Äôs through friends or dms. i‚Äôm glad some people have good experiences and want other people to as well, but it‚Äôs not helpful to nag someone about it if they say no, especially when it‚Äôs a stranger.",ptsd
"I masturbate to my trauma..I feel sick To start off, I HATE what has happened to me. I've been sexually abused since I was 7, by multiple friends and family members. From the age 7 to 18 ‚Äî it's still pretty raw. 

But even though I feel like dying thinking about it, I find myself thinking about it when I masturbate, yeah and I do cum. I feel so much shame and disgust. I hate it. 

I don't know if I'm trying to reclaim my body and free will. But I still don't understand it. 

Am I crazy and mentally fucked? 
Can someone maybe shed some light on it? or something. I'm so confused. ",ptsd

"All dentists (and their assistants) need to be taught about mental health New dental office: ‚ÄúDo you have any medical conditions?‚Äù

Me to assistant: ‚ÄúYes, I have PTSD.‚Äù

Assistant: ‚ÄúOh, ok, are you on any medication for it?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Assistant: ‚ÄúThen it shouldn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs just a cleaning after all.‚Äù

ETA: To be clear, I am not blaming the assistant - they just didn‚Äôt know better and needed to be educated. I‚Äôm annoyed that dental schools don‚Äôt recognize the importance of teaching dental professionals about these things, and more broadly, that mental health is seen as irrelevant to other areas of health.

"My grandmother is dying and I could not care less. Fuck her and that time she tried to kill me. I don‚Äôt even know where to begin.  My grandmother is the most toxic and vile person that I have ever come across.  Not only just in real life either, but even across movies and TV shows.  I can‚Äôt think of a more disgusting repulsive human being.  

My first ever memory from my childhood is of her beating the shit out of me.  I couldn‚Äôt have been more than 6 years old.  I was on the couch in the fetal position trying to cover my head whilst taking shots.  Then I blacked out.  

This is about par for the course for grandma.  In my family they say, ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just grandma being grandma.  Just don‚Äôt think about it.‚Äù

I guess that‚Äôs just what you say when you‚Äôve spent a life time taking beatings from this fucking midget ogre.  I hear my mom and her sisters took beatings even worse than we did.  I still remember her losing her mind and beating the living pulp out of my brother and my cousin.  My grandpa had to tackle her and restrain her on numerous occasions.  Prying whatever object out of her hands that she decided would be the tool she would use to beat us with; Broom handle, wooden beating paddle, bare knuckles with rings, didn‚Äôt matter. 

It‚Äôs not like we were the worst kids in the entire fucking world either.  Like we deserved to be beaten that way.  All you had to do was look at her funny, or say something in the wrong tone, or disagree with her, or express your feelings, or just simply exist and be around her.  Didn‚Äôt matter.  If she wanted to dish out a beating, simply because she felt like it, well then you were going to catch a beating.  

For some reason, everybody in my family still supports and sympathizes with this tragic waste of human life.  I can only imagine this must be due to Stockholm syndrome.  I sure as hell don‚Äôt fucking understand it.  Fuck her.  

The first and only time that I (or anybody for that matter) ever tried to stand up to her I almost died.  She was calling my girlfriend a slut because she liked to wear thigh high skirts.  I told her so what, I like the way she dresses and that‚Äôs all that matters.  She told me her parents should be ashamed of her, I interrupted her and told her ‚Äúyeah but you‚Äôre not her parents,  she can do whatever she wants and she can wear whatever she wants.  You are not her mother.‚Äù  Grandma screams at me ‚ÄúEXCUSE ME!  DONT YOU EVER TALK TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER THAT WAY!  YOU LISTEN AND SHUT UP!‚Äù  To which I carelessly and recklessly replied ‚Äúfuck you, go fuck yourself.  Nobody cares what you think‚Äù

She grabbed the biggest knife out of the kitchen, at minimum a 12‚Äù kitchen utility knife, and trotted her fat ass right towards me.  Fire burning in her eyes.  I jumped out of my chair and threw it behind me in the hopes that it would get in her way and slow down her chase.  She stops at the other end of the kitchen table.  I‚Äôm at the opposite corner, trapped.  I instinctively grab the other chairs and pull them out, hopping I can use them some how to escape.  We play a game of cat and mouse.  Jab stepping both left and right to see who is going to make the first move.  The stupid bitch takes my bait and goes right to where I faked, I dip and go around the other way.  She lunges at me over the chairs and table, swiping at me with the giant fucking blade in her hand.  I narrowly escape.  I dip and bend my torso to avoid her savage attempts at murdering me.  I sprint down the hall to my room.  I try to shut the door but she‚Äôs right behind me trying to push it back open. I shove the door back into her and just barely get it to close behind me.  I lock the door handle whilst she kicks, punches, and stabs at the door.  All while screaming and screeching that she‚Äôs going to fucking kill me.  

I call the police.  They arrive moments later.  I‚Äôve already packed a bag of my necessities.  I just want to get the fuck out of dodge.  The cops escort me out as my my grandmother screams and yells to the cops to arrest me, to kick me out of her house.  I walk out quietly and tell the cops I just want to leave and go to my friends house.  They oblige.  

This woman, my grandma, this piece of shit Is the reason that I suffer from PTSD.  I don‚Äôt believe in a heaven or a hell, there is no reasoning or justice for the bull shit that she‚Äôs put me through, but I hope she spends eternity suffering a miserable existence.  I don‚Äôt care what or where that is, just make her as miserable as she‚Äôs made the rest of this world.  

Fuck you grandma you lousy piece of shit.  I don‚Äôt give two shits about your final days here on earth.  I hope it hurts, I hope you regret everything.  I will never forgive you.  You are not my family.  We may be related by blood, but you are not my family.  I get to choose the people in my family.  Good fucking riddance.",ptsd

Back in December the week before Christmas I was raped by a guy I had just started to get to know, who I really thought I had a chance with‚Ä¶ We had met up in person once and then the next time he raped me. I keep trying to understand how I feel and process everything and it seems like one week I‚Äôm okay, the next I‚Äôm depressed, then angry, then shameful, so many feelings. When he raped me I was at home and i told him I didn‚Äôt want to have sex before he came over, maybe I shouldnt have let him in.. i was in my pajamas, a two piece short set.. maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have worn that and he wouldn‚Äôt have done it? We made out before it happened which led to the rape.. maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have done that? I moaned when he gave me oral it seemed like it felt good? Even now I‚Äôm questioning myself if it actually felt good or did my body just think it did? While he was penetrating me I didn‚Äôt do anything but lay there and space out and the only words I could really mumble were ‚ÄúI said I didn‚Äôt want to do this‚Äù and he just kept saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell me no, I don‚Äôt like when you tell me no‚Äù‚Ä¶ I should‚Äôve fought harder.

Why did I answer the phone when he called even though it gave me panic attacks?? What‚Äôs wrong with me?? Was it even rape if he wasn‚Äôt rough with me?

"does anyone else have hypersexuality as a trauma response? 
tw for mentioning sexual abuse 

i often see sa victims discuss how their abuse has left them with fear of intimacy or distrust in relationships. sa victims who feel torn and want justice for their abuse. 

i feel alone when i say i feel the opposite. don‚Äôt get me wrong, i know what happened to me was abuse. it‚Äôs just that i enjoyed what happened to me and i can‚Äôt shake that feeling. my flashbacks are usually calming and i actively seek out relationships like i had with my abusers. 

the people in my life know i have ptsd but i‚Äôve only just started opening up to others about this. i was just wondering if anyone else here experiences something similar to what i feel. i feel extremely messed up for even admitting that i enjoyed being abused and that there‚Äôs something wrong with me. i feel guilt, shame, and contempt for myself for sexualizing what happened to me when so many others suffer from the same type of abuse.",ptsd
"Think the stigma ever goes away? Think again. Two nights ago I had a pretty uncomfortable conversation with one of my best friends. I‚Äôm not sure if this necessarily has changed our friendship but it just reinforces that there is a long way to go with society‚Äôs view of mental health issues - especially in healthcare where they are ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to at least show some compassion in treatment.

But anyways, my friend is an ER nurse and no lie she works in a pretty rough spot. I know she‚Äôs got to see some shit every hour. I get that. I‚Äôm a school teacher at a rough school too. I get frustrated with shit. I know with my ptsd, I might have something in common with the harder students. So I keep an open mind and heart.

Anyways, that‚Äôs why it was hard when my friend started laughing and talking about one of the patients that came in. She gave me details, it was basically a man who was suffering at first what they thought was hallucinations/paranoia. Turns out he was a war veteran and experiencing severe flashbacks, talking to himself, screaming, flailing, you get the picture. 

I was shocked at her tone and how she was laughing, I suppose out of shock herself because she had to help restrain the man and called the cops to transport him to a different psych hospital. At the end of her story, I just said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think that could‚Äôve been me? What‚Äôs so funny about that?‚Äù

I could tell immediately she was thrown off and she just started insisting that no, mine was different and blah, blah, blah. Like no. That man and I might have different symptoms/circumstances but we‚Äôre still in the same boat. How am I supposed to feel when a health care professional has that attitude - and when that person knows the delicate details of my own condition? 

Sorry for this rant but I suppose I needed to get it off my chest. As I‚Äôm wondering how far we have to go in order to get people to understand us, have sympathy. We don‚Äôt choose our triggers, we can‚Äôt wish the trauma away. We can‚Äôt put a band aid on our brains.",ptsd
"I'm a man who was raped by a woman I understand most people don't take this seriously. The first and only time I have ever told anyone else outside of writing it here, I was told ""So, you got laid. Coolio. Good for you! There's no way you didn't like it. She's hot, man, how was it?!"" Had I been a young female, I think my friend's reaction and people's reaction would be different. But because I'm a man, I like sex, apparently.

Anyway, I was in college and starting to deal with my childhood traumas. I opened up to a woman not much older than me for the first time about that stuff. We were in class and tasked with writing a personal story and share it with our partner for feedback with regards to the style of poetry we were told to use. The first red flag should have been when she asked ""Are you **sure** you were abused as a kid?"" When I defended myself gently, she apologized very much and so forth. During our break, we got a coffee and she leaned in to kiss me. I leaned back and apologized, saying that I wasn't comfortable with being intimate with anyone that I wasn't at least a year or more into a relationship, and how I was also the type to save sex for marriage."" ""Sure you are."" She said smiling. She forced herself on me, kissing me, and I caved. Anxiety. Fear, my body saying yes while my mind was trying to escape in fear.

Long story short, we had a back-and-forth love/hate relationship and I was too spineless and weak to break out a partnership in class off. She needed my help with something one night at her house, and she paid me for it. All good. But then she pushed me on the sofa, took our clothes off... and I'll leave the rest up to your imagination. I felt broken, nearly crying in front of her, but then played it off as anxiety and anger, scurrying out of her home, barely putting my clothes back on before exiting the door. 'Was that good for you too, baby?"" She said when she saw me leaving. When I'd tried to fight her off initially, she was like ""I always control the situation. Why would you fight me? Just let it happen, let me ride you, you might like it since you're a virgin, I promise you'll be safe. Learn from your past punishment.""

I'm pretty logical. I haven't done therapy for this, but previous traumas and never found therapy helpful. But this just gets to me because since I am naturally attracted to women, I have this poor defense when I'm near one because I know that I probably wouldn't be strong enough to fight one off of that happened. When a man did the same, I was able to try at least, to fight it off because there was no level of attraction. Yes, I orgasmed in her and that's what breaks me. I made a vow to save sex for marriage and she forced it out of me. Maybe I shouldn't say forced, since I wasn't strong enough to stop her. If I had... anyway. It's been years since this happened and I feel more ashamed about the girl-raping-guy part than the guy on guy part.

After years and years of holding on to various traumas that manifested themselves in a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from excruciating nightmares and panic attacks to hallucinations and psychosomatic heartache, I finally went through an intense process of treatment. I was so skeptical before and during the process(And damn, it was hard), but suddenly, something clicked: I could look back at myself in those memories and feel sad for that girl instead of living in those memories as if they were constantly surrounding me.   
I experienced an intense release of emotion(for quite a while, bless my flatmate's hearts for dealing with me) and my body finally stopped tensing up like it constantly would.

Edit: Thank you for the silver! I wanted to be more clear. I was reading the comments and they were really bumming me out: "" I can't be open about my illness because..."" I had to turn off the notifications. That was never my point. 

Once upon a time, the LGBTQ+ community had to hide themselves. Their lives were in danger. People would murder them... Now it's Pride Month and there is glitter everywhere (and it's also PTSD awareness month). I'm not saying we find individual reasons to stay afraid in the closet.

I dream of living in a world where I don't have to pretend to be neurotypical or ""act"" normal. I want PTSD friends, and PTSD supportive businesses where I can spend my money, and a PTSD job that won't fire me for having symptoms - I want our own civil rights movement. Maybe that's too radical for some... It is a fear based disorder. But PTSD is the normal response of a healthy brain under extreme circumstances. I'm not a freak. You're not a freak. I'm a survivor and so are you. Any of the people who bully me could end up with PTSD on any day, and we will already have a community of safety to help them be better people.

But there's just some days where it really gets to me, and that's when she tells me to just ""get over it"".

So that wasn't fun. My nightmares are occurring much more frequently atm because it's almost the trauma anniversary, and my mom doesn't seem to care or want to help, even though we went through one of the traumas together. It sucks.

"You dont have to justify your diagnosis I posted an article on Facebook about PTSD and my exfiance's aunt commented on it ' Why did you have this? Were you in the service'

I immediately want to respond and defend myself. But I realized I don't need to open myself up about my traumas on a Facebook comment. 

Just because you don't have PTSD from combat experience doesn't mean you weren't traumatized. And you  don't have to justify yourself to anyone. If you opened up to a therapist and they diagnosed you with PTSD that's all the justification you need.

"Do any of you feel as though you attract abusive personalities or that your PTSD makes you more prone to tolerating others that you wouldn't otherwise? ***I am NOT saying that the victim is to blame - nobody EVER deserves abuse or anything less than the best in any relationship dynamic. I do not think that people with PTSD are merely crying wolf over and over; I want to clarify that, so that people don't get the wrong idea. Below is merely my experience, and I know a few friends with PTSD/histories of trauma have related to my experiences & interpretations.*** 

&#x200B;

I've realized that whether it be friends, romantic partners, even roommates - I tend to find myself with people whom are narcissistic & don't want to recover or take accountability for themselves, people whom take advantage of me, or whom are abusive. I know that I don't deserve or want this treatment, but I know that my PTSD often takes over, and doubts the ""red flags"" I feel other people would react to, or I allow many more boundary violations than I should. Essentially, I feel as though the ways in which my PTSD has manifested causes me to allow really abusive, manipulative, etc., people into my life whom I wouldn't otherwise give the time of day.

&#x200B;

Does anybody else experience this? It's really started to fuck with my head, and makes me wonder if my roommate's claims (most recent occurrence of this) are true. Especially since he's started to be all buddy buddy with my other roommate, since I put boundaries in place and I stopped tolerating his BS.

"""Your PTSD can¬¥t be that bad, you have not been to war"" Hello, sorry if this does not fit here, but it is something that has been bothering me for a long time. I am a 20 year old female and have been struggeling with PTSD since my childhood.

"the convo about ptsd vs cptsd is disgusting  Am I the only one who finds the discourse around cptsd and ptsd awful. People saying things like oh ptsd is curable but cptsd isn‚Äôt.

Oh it‚Äôs just a little event but mine was my childhood. Like genuinely do you feel good as someone with ptsd saying that to someone who dealt with something traumatic? We all suffer and we all will suffer for a long time although therapy and medication can help all of us possibly reach remission. Also as far as ptsd being curable quit citing treatment centers website as fact. Why would they say it isn‚Äôt curable? They want business of course they will say they can fix it.

"I lost to my abuser in court i want to say thank you if you take the time to read my thoughts and feelings. thank you for making me feel less alone. 

Recently, I went to court with the man who assaulted me after over a year of waiting. I testified as the sole witness, as we were totally alone when it happened. He had a better lawyer, who berated and humiliated me on the stand with complete lies. I lost.

I know how important it is to get therapy for this kind of thing, and i‚Äôve tried, but it seems most therapists i‚Äôve met don‚Äôt know how to help me with this grief. I‚Äôm sharing my feelings in hope that someone out there knows what i‚Äôm going through. 

This has made me question everything i‚Äôve ever understood. The justice system FAILED me and so many other women who have been victimized by the predator who hurt me.

"I learned to deeply hate men from men. I was sexually assaulted at an age where I was too young to understand the numbers 1-10, so I can never give an exact age. It was so traumatic that my mother didn't even have that talk with me. ""Don't let people touch down there"", once I remembered and understood, she had a look of pure shock in her face as a smiled and tried to laugh it off because that's how I always was.

I quickly attained a hatred for men since my father was a huge misogynist, to a point other relatives in misogynistic relationships would say he's a ""misogynistic pig!"".

Then in my teens I was drugged and r*ped with multiple men hearing me yell no, yell for help once. That's when it all clicked... Yet I was drugged and couldn't fight with my strength... I'm devastated in my life by men.

I can only name 3 abusive women and then I can generalize an entire gender out of pure survival. I had male friends who were genuine. I simply did not trust them and cut them off. That's it.

I'm done, I'm so done. Male after fucking male in my life and only one is actually semi-sympathetic and he even needs a reality check every now and then!

Anger. Devastation.

Ukraine had mass r*pe. That happened in the last year. It dates back longer than the Japanese mass r*pe, so bad that they burn and hunted down evidence.

"My therapist revealed his goal was to convince me to reconcile with my abusers So I (26 F) finished breaking up with my therapist/had my last session yesterday.

I already had a small list of reasons that I'd written down, including him feeling the need to explain misogyny to me, his desire to treat my fear of men as my biggest issue, etc etc when I have a lot of trauma from my abusive parents that I wanted to process.

Before I got into all that though, I had some questions to help me going forward. I asked: what IS processing trauma? What does that look like? and what are the steps to take following that to relieve the betrayal I feel?

In the course of answering these questions he kept coming back to one thing: that must talk to the people who wronged me and explain myself and try and mend the relationship. I asked him then, what would be the next steps if I were talking about an abusive ex boyfriend and he STILL said the only path forward was to meet with the ex (in public because SaFeTy Is PaRaMoUnT) and talk it through with them. which I don't even know if I believe, or if he was just refusing to give me an alternate answer.

In the beginning i was VERY clear that my family was abusive and I had cut all contact with them, and that the reason I had issues with past therapists was BECAUSE they wanted me to reconcile. I thought I had been clear enough. Now it's obvious that no matter what I say, they think I can only want estrangement because I am too ill to knoe what's best. That my desire for separation is because of MENTAL ILLNESS.

"I don't need a ""breakthrough"" I need relief. I need life to be more than an endurance test It's not a matter of reframing, I'm not delusional, I'm not in denial, or suppressing my memories:  I'm VERY KNEELY aware of how I'm impact by PTSD. Clinical discussions don't change how I feel, nor do labels. Coping isn't sufficient for me to do more then surivive. Being aware doesn't equal relief and if I cannot do things like work a job, have a relationship, have regular restful sleep, feel the full range of emotions, or even get through a single day without being drained, I'm not sure how I am supposed to have a good quality of life.",ptsd

Even taking prescribed pain medicine after a surgery was laughed at.

"I called out my abuser in his establishment‚Äôs TripAdvisor comments for what he did to me and all the girls in the group I was traveling with. I feel both empowered and very alone. Ten years ago I traveled abroad with a group for a ‚Äúgap year‚Äù in South America. We had a weird and terrible experience when we went to a spa retreat owned by an ex-pat American man. 7 of the other girls were molested during a ‚Äúspiritual healing‚Äù ceremony without anyone saying a word, they all were 18 and that‚Äôs the only reason I can think they didn‚Äôt speak up. I went last and fought the abuser and got out of there, then went to my group leader with it and as I told her about it the rest of the group chimed in saying ‚Äúme too me too!‚Äù Against our wishes the group leader told the abuser the reason why we decided to leave early, and the abuser came to my room at night to try to tell me it was all innocent. I was still just a kid but I had to be the face of the group. Then our own group‚Äôs leader talked to me about it later in the trip and said it was all a misunderstanding, that things were different back in the hippy days and she was raised with that kind of thing and he didn‚Äôt mean anything by it. I went home from the trip afraid of being touched at all by my significant other and it took months for me to recover enough to just be touched. 

Flash forward to today. I watched a documentary about a man who abused foster kids, and at the end the story said the abuser had moved to a tiny island outside Guam where there was little oversight. I remembered my experience and I realized it‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs still out there doing exactly the same thing. Sure enough, his TripAdvisor is full of recent reviews - he‚Äôs definitely still in business. And as I searched I found out a woman went to his establishment and was raped by him, two months after our group‚Äôs visit. She traveled back to his country with her husband to sue him and talk to the media. Reading this really validated my experience because I had been wavering in my mind about the experience all these years. But this was a totally separate incident right at the same time we were there. 

So, I wrote about the experience in detail in their TripAdvisor comments. I explained exactly what happened in that public forum. I felt I needed to take some sort of action and I think this was an impactful thing to do. I‚Äôm worried TripAdvisor might take the comment down. I got a message back from his wife on my review and it essentially said I must be mistaken. It brings me joy to think he and his wife had to revisit this subject yet again, and that I might save someone else from going through what I did. 

It feels good to have done it but it hurts me that I can‚Äôt share it with anyone. I feel empowered but also alone.

Edit: Thank you for the support. I have actually been feeling guilty for possibly hurting this guy‚Äôs family‚Äôs livelihood and started questioning myself, so your support is really appreciated. I‚Äôm thousands of miles away and relatively anonymous, but I still don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù.",ptsd

"My husband shot himself right next to me. Me (28F) and my husband (30M) have been together since we were teenagers. We have two kids together a 4yo and a 2yo, both boys. For the most part, our relationship was great. We were each other‚Äôs first everything. First kiss, first relationship, etc. and I had noticed that this did make us extremely codependent on the other over time. Me and my husband both struggle with mental health problems. My husband more so than me. 

We got married after being together for 6 years and went right into having children. After we had our first son, things started getting really difficult. My husbands mental health began to spiral. The financial burden became fully his because couldn‚Äôt work due to health complications during my pregnancy. We had also decided that it would be more smart for us financially if I stayed home with our son, rather than getting a babysitter. 

Once our oldest became about two years old, I did go back to work to help relieve some stress and we hired my little sister to help with the kids. It helped a lot financially but my husband pretty much checked out mentally with things involving our marriage and being a parent. During the next (roughly) 3 years and one more child later, our relationship became fully platonic. This is something that deeply bothered me and I felt that we needed to fix because we both deserved better. I told my husband about how I was feeling several times and that I wanted to go to marriage counseling but he was firm on not going because he felt they would recommend separation. Which eventually lead to me asking for a separation because I had become so unhappy. 

We had been separated for a couple of weeks and the amount of peace I felt really made me realize that I wanted a divorce. So I told my husband how I was feeling. This did not go very well. He wasn‚Äôt so much angry, as just giving off a very uncomfortable vibe. I decided to take a bath and try to relax from all of the stress, and that is when I received the text. 

It was a suicide text. And he told me that if he couldn‚Äôt be with me that life was not worth living. The time stamp was two minutes earlier so I knew I needed to hurry to get to my bedroom where he had locked himself in. 

I jumped out of the bath, grabbed a towel, tried to open our bedroom door but it was locked (I didn‚Äôt realize he had locked himself is there at this point). So I ran to the kitchen, grabbed a butter knife and slide it into the door frame to unlock the door. Once I got into the room, my two year old had followed me and I didn‚Äôt know this because I was focused on helping my husband. He had locked himself in our master bathroom and I couldn‚Äôt get the door open. 

I was shaking the handle, screaming for him, asking what he was doing. He didn‚Äôt answer. I continued to shake the handle and I felt him hold it. And then I heard A loud pop and I heard his body hit the floor. Nothing but a full on wail came out of me. With my two year old right there. I immediately called 911 and grabbed my babies and my sister (she lives with us and heard this from the kitchen) and we waited on the porch, screaming and crying while the police came. 

My husband survived. He lost his right eye and most of his tongue. We do not know what exactly his quality of life will be. But I am grateful he survived. 

I‚Äôm also incredibly traumatized. My two year old screams all of the time now too. I have so many emotions it‚Äôs hard to process. I don‚Äôt understand how he could just leave me with all of this. Knowing that I would have to grieve and still parent my kids, and still have to figure out how to do all of this while overcoming all of this trauma that he put me through. 

A lot of my family doesn‚Äôt seem to understand. They think that because we had been together for so long that we need to try to work this out. But now I am terrified of him and my decision to get a divorce just feels more solidified. I want no romantic relationship with him. I have nightmares every night. I have to live in the house where my husband shot himself three feet away from me. And I feel like everyone thinks I‚Äôm this bitch who is abandoning my husband when he needs me the most. 

I just don‚Äôt know  where to begin with the healing process. I was given a few resources for counseling but I can‚Äôt bring myself to call yet. I guess I just wanted to share my story on here as a way to relieve from sort of stress.

EDIT: Wow. Thank you all so much. The amount of support I am getting from all of you is incredible. My feelings feel validated and that helps me so much more than I can even describe. I am dealing with immense guilt, anger, depression, all while trying to be a good mom to my babies and trying to survive living in this house where I‚Äôm reminded of the entire ordeal every day. I made an appointment for trauma counseling next week. Just talking to the counselor on the phone was already helpful because I felt validation. So I am hoping this is a step in the right direction. Last night was especially hard and I cried for several hours straight just dealing with all of the pain and emotions and confusion. I am going to start the process in going forward with a divorce because like many of you have stated, my instincts are telling me to run. I have nightmares every night that he is shooting himself in front of me, or running around the house with a gun trying to kill me and my boys. I have never in my life experienced trauma like this and I appreciate all of you for being so supportive and understand. This helps more than you know.",ptsd

"Why are people so cruel to those with trauma? Everyone seems to be of the opinion that talking about your trauma or seeking therapy is the healthy way to deal with your trauma. I think to some extent you can find SOME support or validation this way but people don't tell you to brace yourself for the hostility you'll receive when talking about your trauma too.

You'll lose friends when you talk about trauma. Many people are fair weather friends and will abandon you if you are struggling. Others will stigmatize ptsd. Some will be downright bullies and call you a p*ssy or a coward. Others will minimize your trauma and mock you. Yet if you try to keep the conversation light and joke about your trauma, others will get offended by you and say you're trying to be edgy or call you a troll.

It seems like so many people misunderstand where I'm coming from when I do try to talk about it and I don't understand WHY they are so mean. I don't understand why it's even advised to talk about your trauma in the first place if there's so many sick people out there that seem to like to kick people when they're low. Every now and then I'll get a mature conversation with someone on the topic, but I think it makes most people uncomfortable. Sometimes I like to analyze things and I will go over a topic ad nauseam and it doesn't bother me but it seems to enrage other people so they lash out at me and I don't know why? 

Can anyone relate? And what do you do about it? Do you just keep your trauma to yourself? Are you supposed to lie and pretend nothing bad ever happens? What is the goal even supposed to be when people encourage you to talk about your trauma with others if it only seems to upset other people?",ptsd

It was amazing. I haven‚Äôt felt physical affection in 13 years. I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I don‚Äôt even know them at all. I‚Äôve never believed in god, but sometimes I wonder if we do have people looking out for us. It‚Äôs just such strange timing. Plus the topic was brought up in aa meeting tonight. So another coincidence. 

Just thought it was strange, but it saved my life. Maybe I can improve myself enough where people will give me a chance again.",ptsd
"Does Anyone Else feel shame for not being able to work because of their trauma? Hello 

So I have PTSD and it can be so debilitating sometimes that I am in and out of bed all day. I dissociate daily and feel anxious constantly. I'm a full-time college student and it can be so hard to focus on the simplest assignments or even taking notes in class. I'm in therapy and taking SSRIs and Buspar for anxiety.

I come from a very ""just get over it"", ""put yourself up and move on"", ""stop being so sensitive"" sort of family. My mom essentially forced me to not accept all of my aid money for school so she could financially support me with my groceries. Other than the fact that she barely gives me enough to live off of, she also expects me to get a job.

Don't get me wrong. I really really want to work and be independent, but I feel like dealing with the symptoms of my trauma is a job in and of itself. How can I possibly work when I can hardly keep myself from dissociating and I can have a flashback at any moment? I feel so much shame because I feel like I should be able to work just like everyone else and function just like anyone else.

Does anyone else feel this way? How do you cope with this and stop feeling so much shame for how your brain responds to trauma? Thank you for reading <3",ptsd
"I miss my intelligence Since my major trauma 7 years ago (along with other traumas) which have caused me to spend most of my days in a dissociative fog, I feel like the act of thinking is so difficult. I was labeled a 'gifted' child, and I remember my mind being quick. But now, my cognitive processes feel so scrambled up and sluggish. I get so confused sometimes I have trouble filling out simple forms or answering questions on the phone.

"Does anyone else get dreams that isn't about their traumatic event, but have themes of it? TW sexual abuse/ assault description 

If anyone wants more info into what happened to me, you can check my profile.

I've had quite weird and scary dreams these past two nights. The first one was where I was alone with a man in a car, he resembled my abuser body shape wise. I was in a parking lot and the man was in the front seat and I in the back. He got out and walked to where I was, I immediately began to panic even though he didn't enter the car. I was thinking that something bad will happen, he entered the car and I scooted away from him, the dream gets blurry from here but I vividly remember that feeling of extreme fear and helplessness while he was hugging me or having his arm around my waist. (I'm scared of hugs because of what happened to me, I guess that might be connected but I don't know) I was just feeling so so terrified, and I felt that exact same blood curdling fear when the traumatic event was happening. I felt completely frozen both in the dream and the original event. 

Then I was outside a police station and that's where it ended. (I never reported) 

The second one is a lot more obscure and confusing, it was like any ordinary weird dream, I was driving somewhere, it felt as if I was in a video game, but then I was again at a police station. I was inside of the building and then I hear a 17 year old girl scream, 'get off me, get the fuck off me. I'm 17. Stop it, stop it.'

I began to feel fearful and I froze again, but I got the courage to turn the corner and I caught a small glimps of an older man cuddling this girl, I'm assuming it was tight since she couldn't get away. She started to scream something about her boyfriend but her voice didn't sound like it was a little whimper, it was screams of anger, frustration and being fed up. But the man wouldn't let her go.

Then a woman police officer was way too calmly walking down the hallway this was happening, it looked like she won't do anything about the situation because of the way she walked but I woke up straight after seeing that officer so I don't know if she would've done something or not. 

I'm just in a weird place right now. I've been having dreams of sexual assaults/ abuse, even rape (I was never raped) ever since the traumatic event happened. I never had dreams like that before, never. 

Can anyone relate to my situation and is this normal?? I feel so ashamed that I'm having such fucked up dreams even though I was never raped, or touched anywhere private without my consent.",ptsd

"I wish more people spoke about the trauma of being poor Roughly two years ago, I was homeless. I‚Äôm housed now thanks to subsidized housing but still struggling greatly. 

Ptsd puts our mind and body into survival mode, but that‚Äôs extended so much when basic things like food aren‚Äôt a guarantee. 

I‚Äôve talked about it with my therapist. Went over the hierarchy of needs and how often when our most basic needs aren‚Äôt met, we struggle to do anything. 

Doing tasks that aren‚Äôt basic needs for survival become more difficult. It makes sense really. Our survival instinct is we need food to survive. Why would we care about anything else? 

It‚Äôs stressful. It‚Äôs draining. I sit and worry about if we will have food in the fridge in the next few days. I worry if I‚Äôll lose the roof over my head again one day. All I do is worry about it. 

It‚Äôs also draining because often the body isn‚Äôt getting what it needs to function. If you rely on the food bank to feed yourself your meals aren‚Äôt what you need them to be. Things like milk, eggs, meat, fresh veggies and fruits often aren‚Äôt available. You don‚Äôt get enough to make GENUINE home cooked meals.

"I found my mother's dead body I don't usually make posts like this, and I've never used Reddit before, but I just need to get it out. I've never told anyone this before, never allowed myself to really think about it either.

Almost a year ago, my mother died of alcohol poisoning. She had it coming, surprise it didn't happen earlier. I came home from school to find her laying on the couch. Not unusual, I didn't think much of it and went on with my day, thinking she had just fallen asleep there like countless of other times. 

A few hours later when I came out of my room, she was still laying there. I started to worry a bit, but knew it was probably nothing. Came closer (bad idea usually), started looking for signs of life. Nothing. No breathing. No pulse. Wouldn't move when I probed her.

Started to panic real hard, I can't tell you what I was going through at that moment as I was just a mess of ""Ohmygod she's dead she's dead."" I called my sister and she immediately came home. Honestly the next few hours were a blur. My dear sister took care of everything, I was barely there.

Afterwards, I told everyone I was fine. My sister, the social workers, my teachers. But even now, a year later, I can't get over how traumatizing that was. Everytime I come home from school, I get that image in my head of her on the couch. I have to stop myself from throwing up when I even smell alcohol. It haunts my dreams and everyday life.

"I feel ashamed for having PTSD when other people have much more traumatic and understandable causes than mine I know veterans aren‚Äôt the only ones who have PTSD, and I know there are plenty of veterans who probably also feel weak or ashamed or embarrassed for having PTSD. I‚Äôm not a veteran, and I can‚Äôt stop feeling like my reason for having PTSD isn‚Äôt good enough or isn‚Äôt as bad as other people‚Äôs, especially veterans‚Äô. 

I went through almost a year in a relationship filled with emotional and sexual abuse, and now almost half a year of the reporting process with my college that has honestly ended in disaster, with the conduct board blaming me instead of my abuser. I know what I went through was traumatic, I know that PTSD is what I‚Äôm struggling with now, but I feel so weak and ashamed for it. I don‚Äôt mean for this to seem insensitive to anyone, but for some reason I can‚Äôt stop thinking that at least veterans with PTSD (or others who got PTSD from service to others or their country) got it while doing something brave and noble, while I got it from just letting another person have power over me and letting that person make me afraid. 

If I had just been more assertive, maybe he would have stopped. I could have just left ‚Äî I know now all of his implied threats were empty anyways ‚Äî he never would have hurt himself, he was just saying that. 

I only let this happen to protect myself. I have no noble reason for it. I was selfish and dumb and naive, and it really is my fault for letting this happen. There are plenty of people, like veterans and firefighters and EMTs and police officers and doctors and nurses who have PTSD as a result of serving their country and their community, not from being too weak to stand up for themselves like I was. 

On the one hand, I really believe this, that it‚Äôs my fault, that I should have said something, and that other people who have PTSD are so much more worthy of support and admiration because they‚Äôve been through so much more difficult things for better, more noble reasons than me. But on the other hand, I rationally know that that‚Äôs not how this works, or at least I hope it‚Äôs not.

"Technique for intrusive memories I come from Scandinavia. We fish a lot, in wooden boats on the fjords. And the sea is so vast, deep, blue and endless. If we catch a fish you cannot eat, we unhook it and toss it back into the sea. Where it swims away, into the deep.

So, when I try to sleep and intrusive memories pop up. I think ""back into the sea"", catch and release. And I imagine just letting it go and how vast ocean is, and how it is room for it there. Then I actively focus on daydreaming about something cozy and pleasant instead. So that cozy fills my mind. And strangely, this works a lot of the time.

"My boyfriend nearly died and I can't stop hearing the sound. Earlier today we were out with some friends, chilling and relaxing as one does. We started to mess around with a ball and a bat and eventually I hear this sickening whack and a moan, I look over and my boyfriend is falling over with a bat stuck to his forehead. I launch into a run and my friend and I drag him inside, same friend that hit him, and I call an ambulance. Skip ahead a bit and the last thing I see of him is him shivering with blood all over his face, in his hair, on the ground, just everywhere and It stains my eyelids. He gets dragged into an ambulance and I can't see him anymore, just the frantic shaking as they work inside. I looked down at my hands and one of them was also coated in blood. And I just couldn't. It is  hours later and I have been uncontrollably sobbing for at least an hour and a half. I don't know why I feel the need to share this story but thank you for reading. I am not really looking for support as I know this feeling will probably fade once he recovers. The doctors said his brain scan was fine and he had no broken or fractured bones so that's something. More than anything I am just immeasurably grateful to still have him in my life and this experience has strengthened my love for him 20 times but that deep dreadful feeling when watching someone you love possibly die, it is haunting and that sound will forever be burned into my mind. Again, thank you for taking the time to read this nightmare.

Update: after a few hours of uncontrollable sobbing I eventually passed out while watching over him without even realizing. Thank you for your ideas to help me calm myself. His wound doesn't seem to be any worse after sleeping so I think the healing process is going to be good.

Update 2: Things are looking good, after a lot of talking and being there for each other he is forming thoughts and holding focus better now, he was able to sleep off and on but couldn't fully rest. I am also much better now, the recommendation to play Tetris really helped me calm down and I will be forever thankful my eyes were opened to that.

"It‚Äôs been 27 years since I was raped by a 20 year old. I was 14. I just told him off. May report. At age 13, a man saw me riding my bike outside and playing with my sister. 

Back story: My sister and I had experienced a lot of trauma already. We were in separate homes. Our parents were dead, and we‚Äôd survived 2 murders. I was in a verbally and emotionally abusive home. All this led me to feeling worthless and unlovable. 

That‚Äôs why he targeted me. 

Over the course of several months, he stopped to talk to me. Got my number. Started calling and slowly built rapport- I now understand this was grooming. After I turned 14, the calling escalated and he drove over to my house to offer yard work. The male figure of my home had recently died so it was just me and the woman raising me. He flattered her. She was old fashioned and thought nothing of a grown man wanting a young girl. 

Once he got approval, the love bombing started. Before long, the sex. I didn‚Äôt even know what to do or how to do it. In short order, his charm eroded. He began controlling me and calling me ugly and worthless. 

By now, I think this is ‚Äúlove‚Äù. He told me it was love. 

My mental health deteriorated and I ended up suicide attempt with a 2 week hospital stay. I also had a venereal disease that had spread very far requiring iv treatment. 

I got out and the sexual and emotional abuse resumed and one of his friends was after my young friend to boot! 
He never took me on a date. Never showed me any gentleness or tender touch.  He brought one of his friends over to meet me. That friend had some sense and told him what he was doing to me was rape. 

He disappeared abruptly. Tried to come back off and on a few times. I told him off. He did the same thing to five other victims of similar age that I know of!

Over the years, my view of love and relationships was warped by what he did to me. I‚Äôve had other traumas since, but trauma has layers like an onion. This is my core wound regarding men. It took me until I was 40 to realize it!

I made a fake Facebook account and I sent his ass a long winded message about how he victimized me and the state it happened in has no statute of limitations on rape of someone the age I was. 

I still have photos of him and I, not nude, but sexual enough that I believe I could finally report him and possibly get justice. 
It felt good to tell him off. To get my power back.",ptsd

I used to be someone who was in tune and quite sharp and had amazing memory and was a good thinker.

I do Biosciences in a Level 5 HND and I can do it but I just can't seem to grasp the information like I used to and people think I am stupid (and have told me to my face).

"I grieve the person i was before i look at old pictures and videos of me and it breaks my heart. I was so full of life even my eyes looked like they had sparkle in them. I was so loud and confident and wasn‚Äôt scared of anything or anyone for that matter. I walked with a purpose and a sense of happiness every single day. I loved waking up in the morning and I loved going to sleep knowing the next day I would be able to enjoy life again. I was artistic and loved photography it was my passion and pure bliss to me. I was very social and enjoyed traveling and going out. I always felt things with such deep emotion wether it was good or bad and I truly feel like that is why I used to enjoy life so much. My siblings loved being around me and I enjoyed their company just as much. Are favorite thing was to go to the beach and get pizza afterward. I would find the beauty in the tiniest things that normally people would pay attention to. I would laugh at everything especially with my friends. They were the best friends you could ever ask for and I miss them dearly. I miss always being known as the ‚Äúhard working‚Äù person in my friend group. I miss sitting outside in the middle of the night on the porch with my dog feeling the breeze and having this content feeling within myself knowing that whatever happens in the future that I would get through it. 

My trauma has taken that ability to feel at peace in my soul and heart. 

I hope one day my siblings won‚Äôt look at me in such confusion as to why I am not the same anymore. I hope one day I will be able to finish an oil painting without dissociating for long periods of time and not being able to concentrate. I hope one day I am able to hang out with people without freaking out internally because they want to give me a hug.

I started crying and saying ‚Äú you don‚Äôt understand how crippling this is for my daily life I hate too‚Äù. Then without any emotion he flat out said ‚Äú he wanted a partnership not another job ‚Äú and took me home. I blocked his number and cried my eyes out.

"Just dropping in to remind you that PTSD does not make you weak In case you needed to hear it today, you are not weak because you have PTSD.

From eating disorders to self harm I've literally spent my whole life trying to keep my trauma out of my head. It's not a fixation, it's a disorder. Like depression or anxiety or any other. Anxiety isn't you fixating on panic. Depression isn't you fixating on sadness. I understand it's meant with good intentions but I take it as an insult. If I could take a pill to forget, I'd take it many times over.

"ALL medical professionals should be required extensive training on PTSD Just a rant. Its long.

Malware is software written specifically to harm and infect the host system. PTSD is the malware infecting my system and FEAR is the virus that wrecks havoc.

So I have been triggered and my symptoms take over my entire being.
I have 3 options

Flee
Freeze¬†
Or Fight¬†

These are the ONLY options fear will give me, suddenly a harmless and simple situation¬† has turned into a battle for my survival. And yes, to me, its as dire as it sounds. So my logic and reason programming has been overridden -its not gone, its still running, but its only running at minimum so the virus can feed off the program and piggy back on the signal to proceed with the virus‚Äô own programming.

So I am faced with the three options mentioned above. What do they look like?

Flee- Literally leave the situation in any way I can. Seeing as the logic and reason programming is still running albeit at a limitation, I can process enough information from my environment to look for an immediate exit and follow through with fleeing from the situation. Analyzing my environment for an exit is about the only way I can use the logic and reason program that is still running. And this is an immediate reaction, either i phsically leave my environment ASAP or make arrangements and overcoming necessary hurdles to leave. The way I flee is dependant on the trigger that accessed the survival instinct. And the severity of my reaction to flee is also dependant on said specific trigger. No matter what I'm doing or what's going on, when I'm triggered it's time to flee.


Fight- So my fear of my survival has been activated (essentially, my logic and reason program has been infected with the malicious code FEAR) and my logic and reason programming is running at a minimum. I‚Äôve already scanned and processed the option to leave but I have come to the conclusion that fleeing is not an option. Meaning my exits in my environment are blocked or there are people who are blocking my exits. For my reaction to be extreme enough to want to fight, the people blocking my only exits must be some type of authority. For example, police officers, EMTs, or any type of medical professionals. My understanding is¬† that these people are the only people who can act on their authority at will with or without good intent. In civil society, these people are considered as necessary and these people are supposed to hold good intent. I am recounting VIVIDLY how each and everyone of these so called ‚Äúauthority with good intent‚Äù VIOLATED me. Physically and psychologically. Seeing as I don't want to relive said horrible experiences again I consider theses authorities as ENEMIES to my survival whenever I see them when my survival instinct has been severely triggered. I will FIGHT these authorities. I will flail and scream and cry and do whatever makes them feel uncomfortable by being naked or screeching and howling when they touch me.¬† And it seems like, in my experience, these authorities do not have the faculties or understanding to not not treat me like an animal. I mean in all of my recounted experiences of cops, EMTs and nurses they exacerbated my symptoms by physically hurting me and demeaning me. Remember my logic and reason program is still running in the background so i‚Äôm still aware of what‚Äôs being said to me, how they are touching me, how they handle me and what emotions they evoke when they demean me. Plus im cogiscent enough to realize, causing injury to said authorities is a metaphorical DEATH SENTENCE. I don't want to go to jail or be arrested, or treated like a dangerous and malicious mentally ill person, so I am cognizant enough not to cause injury to others- I'm just SCARED and I CRY. Do these professionals really think I‚Äôm a danger to them when I‚Äôm naked and¬† bawling and screeching about being raped and that I don't want to be touched without care? Don‚Äôt I have a right to say ‚Äúdon't touch me‚Äù during perineal care yet said medical professionals disregard my repeated requests? Rendering me even more panicked about being in the ER? They think im insane. Well THEY are the ones who are insane with reasoning that extreme measures of restraint, ridicule and deliberate touching of my clitoris is the only way to treat a frightened, crying, naked young woman. Who let these people be medical professionals? And they get to live their lives thinking they did nothing wrong while I SUFFER .I‚Äôm reliving these memories to the point of not functioning due to the extreme anxiety that these memories induce. I have PTSD from my experience at the ER. PTSD that is being treated with the help of my primary doctor. Who btw, I can barely see because he triggers such horrible feelings and memories.¬†

Medical professionals are suppose to be a beacon of hope, but instead they are psychological abusers. When it comes to psychological trauma, it's like all their training goes out the window and I'm just some animal. These medical professionals should not be¬† allowed to wantonly explain away their cruelty and the robbing of my humanity with a phrase of ‚Äúthat just my job.‚Äù yet I have no name of the woman who touched my clitoris deliberately while providing perineal care. I don't even recall if she was an RN or CNA. But the restraints? Those were uncalled for and I‚Äôm going to have to live with that trauma for the rest of my life.¬†

Freeze: knowing I cant fight or flee my body and brain just shuts down. I'm immobile, incapable of normal interaction. I'm still cognizant of what's around me but I'm being forced to watch the memories like some sick psycho is tying my down to a chair and forcing horrible movies about my life. I'm shivering, holding back tears gripping whatever is in my hand with dear life. Just visible distressed and immobile.

Every single one of these reactions are EMBARRASSING and SHAMEFUL in polite society. I'm no longer worthy to exist because people just dont understand what trauma does to a person.

EDIT: I didn't expect my post would get as much traction as it did! Thank you for your stories! I feel kinda weird for being grateful to share this specific type of trauma with others, yet before the PTSD sub-reddit I felt so alone and so ashamed. I wish you all safe travels on the path to healing!

P.S Any medical professionals who just have the need to ""educate"" me or anyone else on proper EMS procedure with the intention to exonerate EMS personel...well I cant stop you...but just know your unsolicited advice will fall on deaf ears.

P.S.S I'm coming off as angry and maybe a little harsh in my writing tone because...I'm angry ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm not neccesarily proud of sounding so angry but  I think I have the right to do so in order to express the trauma I received. I believe it's part of my personal healing process.",ptsd
"I need to talk about my son. NSFW- Child loss & Domestic Violence




When I was 15 I was in a horrible relationship. We're talking daily violence and essentially 4 years of torture both physical and mental. He was 3 years older than me, he was twice my size and I was completely powerless. 

By the time I was 17 I was completely isolated from everyone I love and utterly reliant on him and when I fell pregnant it was just another excuse for him to control every little thing about my life. He had expressed early on that he had no interest in the baby and did not want to be a father. I missed the majority of my prenatal appointments and had to lie to get to any of them, which was an incredibly risky business. 

A few times I took beatings and was convinced I'd lose my baby because they were always focused around my stomach. But my little one held on and was the only thing getting me through it all. I of course wanted to leave but I had nothing and no one, my family and friends had no idea I was even pregnant. 

When I was 37.5 weeks pregnant he drove me towards his work- his work bordered a massive wooded area/conservation park- and when we got to the most secluded part he pushed me out of the car and kicked and kicked and kicked. Every blow landed on my stomach, I tried to protect my baby, not caring how much he hurt me, but eventually I was in a state of semi consciousness and I couldn't control my body anymore. I cannot describe the pain. Like someone had ripped every single one of my organs out one by one, covered them in acid and put them back in. He walked away from me, got back in the car and drove off. That picture of the car driving away, of laying in the road in more pain than I've ever felt is what haunts my nightmares and flashes in front of my eyes every single day. 

I don't remember much after that. An older couple, in their 60s I think found me and took me to the hospital- I'm told they had no phone signal to call for an ambulance. The next thing I remember is waking up, feeling empty. I knew my baby wasn't there anymore but I had no idea where they were. I was frantic, asking where my baby was, if they were alive. I was so upset I'd pulled out all of my IVs and was trying to get out of bed. A doctor came in and told me that my placenta had ruptured, my baby was alive, but he'd been without oxygen for such a long time they didn't expect him to live through the night. 

I was 17 years old, alone having just had major surgery and now been told my child would likely die. The only thing getting me through and he'd be gone too. They brought him in, this tiny little thing covered in wires and tubes. I'd barely even acknowledged the doctor when he told me that my baby was a little boy. None of it was how it was meant to be, but he was here and he was mine and I promised myself I'd do everything possible to help him and protect him.

Alfie wasn't even on my shortlist of names but when the nurse asked me if I had a name for him, it's what came out without hesitation, it felt right. That nurse sat with me for hours, even after her shift ended so I wasn't alone. We are still friends to this day. I was allowed to hold him with the help of some pillows so I didn't rip my stitches and he wrapped his tiny hand around my finger. The doctor came back regularly to check on him and it was clear even to me that he was deteriorating. I asked them to stop my pain medication so I could remember him more clearly, so I wouldn't forget a single second. They were reluctant but agreed and I held my son for 44 hours and 13 minutes until he took his final breath. 

I'm sure I was screaming, but all I could hear was my ears ringing and I just held him and cried for hours, until they told me they had to take him away. I've never known emptiness like it. My arms were empty, my heart was empty and my stomach was empty. It still feels like someone reached their first into my chest and ripped out my heart, even 8 years later. 

Most of my family and friends still don't even know about Alfie. I can't talk about him out loud. I can't answer their questions and watch their hearts break as well as my own. My amazing best friend knows as does my SO and they're both incredible when the world gets too much. 

Alfie's father is in prison, for the things he did to me and subsequently his now ex-wife and going to court was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I did it for my son, to get him justice, even though it will never bring him back to me. 

If you're still reading, thank you. I'm glad you met Alfie with me. He was born at 11:11 in the morning. So if you happen to catch it on the clock, make a wish on us both.

"Even if it's not the same person, does seeing the name of an abuser trigger the past? You spent time with an abuser named George. He did monstrous things to you and messed you up.

After that bastard is out of your life, you see someone on The Price Is Right named George. He is not the George who abused you. Would hearing that name bring you back to the time you were tortured by George your ex?

So my point is, if you see or hear an abuser's name, can it trigger PTSD?

I am not a sufferer and never experienced abuse. This is more of a psychological question.",ptsd

I went to the station, I was there doy about two hours. The detective was thorough but I was expecting it. I cried lots. The whole thing was recorded, in case they use it in court. 
I feel kinda numb. Telling all those deets was a lot harder than I thought. Charges would be sexual assault and attempt to rape. Only attempt because he didn‚Äôt penetrate me - he wasn‚Äôt hard enough‚Ä¶ and finger penetration doesn‚Äôt count as rape. Oh well.

Hello everyone, I‚Äôm 33F a long time lurker, this is my first time posting. 

I was raped in 2017 and I was diagnosed with PTSD in March. Hard to tell how long it‚Äôs been going on - this past few years have been extremely hard on my mental health. 

I decided on my own accord to report my rapist to the police after a lot of therapy and pondering. I‚Äôm going to the station tomorrow. I was fine, happy, motivated. Now I‚Äôm a freaking mess. 

I will go, that‚Äôs out the question. I guess I just want some support from someone. I‚Äôm very scared. I feel tiny and ridiculous. 

He was my boss. We both had partners and I said no, several times. He said he couldn‚Äôt remember anything - it was during a night out. 2 months later, he opened an investigation to get me fired, but it didn‚Äôt go anywhere and not long after I left. 

I‚Äôm looking for kind words. I‚Äôm scared and scarred. I‚Äôd like to know I‚Äôm not alone. Thank you üíú",ptsd
"having to grow up too fast due to trauma damaged me i used to love when people told me i acted mature for my age. i was always seen as a kid with lots of potencial and very intelligent. this was all due to having to ""grow up"" too fast because of being traumatized since i was 3 years old and developing anxiety disorders. i was a child worried about life and existence, and very very scared. i had toys but i wasn't the typical child who always wanted to have more and more toys, simply because that didn't matter that much. all i wanted was to feel normal.
since i always felt like i had to act older than i was, now that im 18, i feel like crying because i didn't actually get anything from being very ""mature"" for my age. it's all loneliness and regret for wasting my potential, because even tho i really was creative and smart i never had the energy to actually use that potential because i was just so damaged. i just lost my childhood and now at 18 with all this isolation from covid i am starting to realize that i want to be a happy child for just one day. i want to be taken care of and loved instead of yelled at. i don't want to have panic attacks or phobias, or responsibilities etc. i simply want to be a happy kid with no fears just for one day. i want to know what that is like. i hate being a grown up. i feel like that's all I've ever been and I'm exhausted.",ptsd

"I have strong compulsions to tell people about my trauma and it sucks. So, I got my diagnose last year and I have been in denial the majority of the time. 
But this summer has been like an apiffany of me realising it's true.

And then that has escalated into that I'm telling everyone I know about my trauma, I'm even telling strangers at a party if I somehow has gotten triggered by a subject. 

And I always regret it but I can't seem to stop thinking it's a good idea at the moment? I don't know what to do or why I am doing this. It feels like I am ruining myself.

Edit; Thank you all for commenting and liking. I tried to Google this symptom but I didn't find anything about it so I felt like I was the only one.

"Does anyone else jump out of their skin from loud sudden noises? I feel like I'm going fucking insane! My roommate is constantly banging pots and pans around and slamming cabinets in the kitchen. She watches TV insanely loud and when she watches sporting events she screams out randomly and it triggers my PTSD. Also, my upstairs neighbor's stomping around from about 5 p.m. until about 3 in the morning and I feel like I'm going insane from my constant noise.

I realize that people are allowed to live their lives but I'm just sick of being surrounded by the constant noise and it's triggering my anxiety. Sometimes my roommate is so loud that I scream what the fuck was that?! Then she gets mad at me for saying something to her. I'm like well you don't have to slam the fucking cabinets. You could just shut them like a normal person. Then she yelled at me it's not my fault you're sick. And I was like yeah I get that but I still think that you could be a little less noisy.

They can't see how I could possibly be hurting when I don't work right now. Some pople have stopped respecting me, even suggesting that my struggles with ptsd as an excuse for laziness. 

It seems like either people see me as a disabled loser, or a lazy layabout. People treat me like I'm entitled for not wanting to be pushed to my breaking point at a job. I know I can't possible do what it takes to be employed in this economy right now, and even 40 hours was too much before; it was barely sustainable for me.

Maybe that means I'm weak and disabled, I don't know. It's making me start to doubt myself and feel really insecure, like a parasite on society. 
I feel like a loser, a failure, and a broken person when people talk to me as if I'm an inferior or weak for being unemployed.

"I finally understood why I prefer to stay up at night. Its not just insomnia, it's not sleep apnea, just nightmares or the silence.

Of course, when I eventually end up sleeping its out of exhaustion more than anything, but it's better than the dreadful feeling of going to sleep without knowing who or what could end up waking me.

"Brainspotting therapy - OMG, try it! (3 Month Update Below, outlining how I feel now, why EMDR didnt work for me before and why EMDR works for me now)

I am writing this the night of my first mind blowing experience with this therapy. 

4 years of talk therapy for me did nothing. (Results may vary for each person. It may work for you, it just didn‚Äôt for me). 

So I looked into EMDR, because it was hailed as the best for PTSD and especially after reading ‚ÄúThe Body Keeps the Score.‚Äù 

But 8 or 9 sessions in and I just wasn‚Äôt getting it. Feeling it. Just‚Ä¶ nothing. 

I was about to quit yet another form of therapy. 

Then, my EMDR therapist said ‚Äúhey, I just got certified in something called brain spotting. Wanna give it a go?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSure.  What is it?‚Äù 

She then held up a stick with a little ball on the end, looked like a magic wand. 

(This was Telehealth by the way.)

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to to move this very slowly down the screen while you think about the traumatic event we‚Äôve been working on. When you feel something, tell me when to stop.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSomething?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know when you feel it,‚Äù she said.  

‚ÄúThis is total woo woo new-age bullshit I am about to waste my hard earned money on‚Ä¶‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúBut, to hell with it. Got nothing to lose.‚Äù 

‚ÄúJust keep your head still and follow with your eyes,‚Äù she calmly said. 

She then proceeded to move the wand down the screen. Very slowly. 

Nothing. 

Nothing. 

Okay a little something. 

Okay there is pressure in my head. 

Wow, this is getting intense. 

My face red, and tears forming in my eyes I struggled to finally say ‚Äúright there.‚Äù 

I felt it coming to the surface. 

She did the same horizontally across the screen. 

Nothing, nothing, then BAM! A new spot. 

After a couple other movements across the screen that yielded nothing, she asked which of the two previous spots felt stronger. 

I chose the one, where the little ball rested just below her chin.  

For the next 40 minutes, in total complete silence, she held the wand in that position and I just stared at it. 

It was an emotional explosion!  I cried like I never had in therapy before. The event would come to the forefront of my mind and I could literally feel it ‚Äúworking it‚Äôs way forward and out!‚Äù 

I cried so much staring at that ball that snot was pouring out my nose as i deep weeped. 

My mind started with what I felt was my top trauma, then it suddenly shifted to my brothers death - which was 5 years ago and I felt I had handled it well at the time, all things considered. 

But my brain was now telling me that I hadn‚Äôt processed it yet. 

And now it was time to do that. 

Suddenly, I balled like a child. My subconscious showed me that I had blamed  myself partly for his passing - because I wasn‚Äôt there to help him. 

I went from surprise, to sadness, to anger, then ‚Ä¶ self forgiveness. 

Actual, real, self forgiveness. 

There really wasn‚Äôt anything I could have done to prevent it. And suddenly, I embodied that feeling deeply. 

My emotions oscillated on extremes for the entire 40 minutes. My mind was ‚Ä¶ FIXING THE BURIED! 

And all I did WAS STARE AT A BALL ON THE END OF A STICK! 

What??????

More was done in silence in 40 minutes than 4 years of talking. 

And I could just simply FEEL it working. 

I can‚Äôt explain it, but I was just more clear in my head afterwards. Lighter.  

My therapist gently smiled and said ‚ÄúI think we found the modality that works for you.‚Äù 

I cried even more when she said that. 

Because I knew she was right. I felt like I had reached my therapy ‚Äúhome,‚Äù at last. 

It was brutal and hard- and thats how i knew it was where my healing journey was about to finally begin. 

I booked her for weekly visits for two months out, wiped the snot from my nose, cancelled my appointments for the rest of the day and went for a walk in the sun - my mind clear and face grinning for the first time in ages. :)


07/24/22 UPDATE:

Hey all! Sorry for the delay. Going through a move to a new city but wanted to update you guys on my progress.

I have to say, I‚Äôve felt ‚Ä¶ different. Better, different.

Sessions 1-4, were intense, non stop crying for long bouts. 5-7 was about 1/2 crying and ‚Äútrauma work out.‚Äù And last session was ‚Ä¶ no crying.

I was shocked.

So shocked that i said ‚Äúokay, let‚Äôs try EMDR.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I found out what I was doing ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with EMDR before and why it wasn‚Äôt working.

She moved her wand across the screen at a steady back and forth pace for up to 10 minutes. Somewhere along minute 6 or 7 I could feel the trauma coming forward, same as brain spotting (though not as intense now given my precious brain spotting sessions). 

It turns out, EMDR didn‚Äôt work before because the therapists would only have me following the light or finger (or pulse pads) for at most 30 seconds. It never felt like enough time to dig deep.

And this therapist showed me that different brains need different amounts of time to process the movement.

So now we have shifted to EMDR for a couple sessions to see what we can ‚Äúwork out‚Äù still. I won‚Äôt stop until 30 minutes of spotting or EMDR produces nothing.  And I feel oh so close! Perhaps only a month or so away.

Before, I was having numerous bouts of autistic levels of ‚Äústimmings,‚Äù extreme agoraphobia where I couldn‚Äôt leave my bed for fear of, well, everything, and my brain was so pressurized with trauma, I could cry at moment on any day, and this was almost every day since the incident that catalyzed all these feelings. (I was incarcerated in another country for a crime I didn‚Äôt commit, and was treated quite horribly as a result, placed in solitary confinement with no books or outside world contact, only to be proven innocent months later, once all the damage was done). 

I still have anxieties, and pace the room sometimes, but it‚Äôs about 80% less than it used to be.

So I would call that a HUGE win.

I would be happy to share my therapist‚Äôs info if you are based in NV.  You can DM me. I know how hard it can be to find a good one. But honestly, while she is amazing, this therapy kind of can be done by any trauma trained therapist, just ask them to do it longer. If the therapist gets physically tired of moving their finger back and forth, ask for the pulse pads or that they use a wand with a ball on it and to place it propped against the edge of the desk so they can swivel it, keeping its motion consistent and not wearing out the therapist‚Äôs arm.

I feel light bars might be best here, at least for me.

I hope this update inspires some of you who didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù EMDR working or wanted another option.

It does work.

It sounds so new agey. Or bogus.

But man, after years of talk therapy, this is the only thing that made me function again.

I hope all of you find the emotional comfort you you deserve.

You are worth it.

You can get better.

The chains can be broken.

Here's to getting ""you"" back and going from surviving to thriving. :)",ptsd
"Tracked down a man who took advantage of me at like 12yrs old So when I was like 12 on a game called ourWorld I received a gift from someone. He started talking to me, turns out he's this guy older than my mom. But he was friendly and he gifted me like a month of their premium pass, so I kept talking to him. Eventually we move over to Kik, where the conversation got sexual. He sent me naked photos and videos of himself and coerced me into sending some back. I think he even video called me once. He's married BTW.

Well today I remembered that and gave him a Google, I only remembered his Kik username and [other identifying information]. I was able to find his full name, address, phone number, and email.

So I signed him up for every form of scientology mailing list you can be on. Even signed him up for an in person consult tomorrow, so he'll get a call when he doesn't show.

It's scientology. They will NEVER leave him alone. I won't ever see the fallout of this, but I'm pleased.

"Recent trauma due to wife's child birth  TW >!post partum psychosis!<

Hi all. Looking for some advice. My wife gave birth to our first child (a healthy and beautiful baby boy) and then unfortunately suffered a massive psychotic episode that has since been diagnosed as post partum psychosis. I was there by her side for almost the entire thing. The delusions, paranoia, chaotic thoughts along with the manic levels of energy were brutal to watch. And I honestly thought it couldn't get worse until she grabbed my shirt so tight I could barely breath and ended up biting my chin so hard I thought at the time I was losing my face. Thankfully we were at the hospital still when this happened and they were able to get us separated before any significant physical damage was done. 

It was 12 hours long and the bite was three seconds although it feels much longer. Currently I'm at home with a five day old baby, a dog, and a wife who will hopefully be transferred to a psych hospital tomorrow or Monday. This happened two days ago and I have no clue how to move forward except feed my baby and keep him clean. Has anyone else experienced something similar or know of any resources? I am talking to therapists next week but my fears right now are consuming me. 

Thanks so much for any advice, support, whatever. ",ptsd

Go to therapy if you can afford it Bro honestly stop trying to get thru it alone. Act now. Give yourself what you deserve. It‚Äôs like having ptsd is hunger and therapy and medicine is food. You gotta feed yourself or you‚Äôre just gona suffer. You deserve to live in peace. Ask your person(s) for help. That‚Äôs just my opinion and experience. But pls get help.,ptsd

"In an important step toward medical approval, MDMA, the illegal drug popularly known as Ecstasy or Molly, was shown to bring relief to those suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder when paired with talk therapy. ‚ÄúThis is about as excited as I can get about a clinical trial,‚Äù said Dolen  [MDMA Reaches Next Step Toward Approval for Treatment - The New York Times (nytimes.com)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/health/mdma-approval.html) 

Of the 90 people who took part in the new study, which is expected to be published later this month in Nature Medicine, **those who received MDMA during therapy** **experienced a significantly greater reduction in the severity of their symptoms** compared with those who received therapy and an inactive placebo. ***Two months after treatment, 67 percent of participants in the MDMA group no longer qualified for a diagnosis of PTSD, compared with 32 percent in the placebo group.***

**MDMA produced no serious adverse side effects. Some participants temporarily experienced mild symptoms like nausea and loss of appetite.**

‚ÄúThis is about as excited as I can get about a clinical trial,‚Äù said Gul Dolen, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. ‚ÄúThere is nothing like this in clinical trial results for a neuropsychiatric disease.‚Äù",ptsd

"been thinking a lot about ‚Äúmanifestation‚Äù and what a sick joke that can be for people like us. the idea that your life is based on your thoughts. 
my thoughts are fucking terrible. 

the idea that our thoughts are responsible for the good and bad things that happen in life feels like such a slap in the face because it assumes that we are always in control of what we think. 
goes hand in hand with ‚Äújust move on‚Äù 
‚Äúthe past is the past‚Äù ‚Äúof course you feel bad when you dwell‚Äù 

also manifestation can bring into question whether my thoughts caused my trauma, and that goes deeper into more feelings of blame and guilt.

"Lady Gaga suffers from PTSD and this important tw:rape So today came out a Lady Gaga interview where she revealed to be raped by a producer who ended up getting her pregnant.

The Marry The Night video clip actually gave us a hint about it and it's been something fans always thought about, today we got a confirmation. 

I am feeling anxious, sad, I cried, I am feeling awful. 

My person take on this: I just got out of ICU and this almost death experience brought to life another traumas in my life, one of them is similar to what Gaga has been through.

My religious, idiot father sent me a text message of Jesus dying on the cross . A very graphic one with the look of torture on his face and blood dripping all over his head and body. 

I immediately text him..
‚ÄúWhat the fuck ! Why are you sending me graphic images for !!! I‚Äôm blocking you! I‚Äôm not even Christian for fucks sake! ‚Äú 

As I‚Äôm in the process of blocking him, he sends me that picture AGAIN.

I show my mom, she goes to his room to talk to him.

I walk pass by raising my voice ..‚Äù stop sending me that shit! Do you think I want to see blood like that ?! Do you think I want to see blood like ?!!!!! U fucking idiot ! U think I don‚Äôt remember ?!! I remember every-fucking-day !!! Fuck u !!! ‚Äú

( btw , I never swear especially at my parents ^ but I was really upset ^ )

Next thing,  I‚Äôm collapsed on the floor having a full blown panic attack . It lasts almost 30 mins. I couldn‚Äôt get up, so I crawled to my room to look for a bottle of Ativan. Took 1 to calm down.

After, I looked in the mirror, the blood vessels burst around the skin of my eyes, temples &amp;amp; on my forehead.

Note : if my father wasn‚Äôt an inconsiderate, self-righteous, bigoted idiot, maybe he‚Äôd remember that I lost my cousin (whom I was closest to) along with her unborn son, 4 years ago from an extremely, graphic homicide committed by her husband. 

It‚Äôs been 2 years since my last panic attack, each panic attack I‚Äôve had was triggered by the subject or any reminder of my cousin. My father witnessed almost all my panic attacks.

"Infantilization of sexual assault victims? Trigger warning for mentions (not descriptions) of assault I‚Äôm curious about whether other people have experienced this, or feel that it‚Äôs annoying in any way.  
It seems to me that there‚Äôs a very particular way we talk about victims of sexual assault, and that it‚Äôs different from the way we talk about other people who have developed ptsd.  
For example: I recently got invited to a virtual event for survivors of sexual assault where we are supposed to write love letters to our former selves.  It‚Äôs all very ‚Äúglitter and craft scissors‚Äù.  
Even the metaphors used to talk about us are often full of things like butterflies and flowers blooming after a forest fire.  Very saccharine and childish.  
And when I was looking for resources about sexual recovery after trauma, everything I found was focused on gentle, romantic, candles-and-soft-music sex.  There seemed to be no general understanding that some people looking for sexual recovery might just want to, excuse my language, have fun and fuck.  I found it all very flowery and unhelpful.  
I guess I feel like it‚Äôs dehumanizing.  Like it ties in with the way we expect women to be sweet and innocent and pretty, and so when something ugly and real happens to us it‚Äôs got to be buried in sunshine and sugar.  I would far rather we just be seen as grubby little humans like everyone else.  
Am I alone in this?  I don‚Äôt see military PTSD getting the same treatment (nobody is asking veterans to sit down with glitter and craft scissors to write love letters to their former selves).  I mean no offence at all to anyone who prefers this kind of language, and I‚Äôm so happy for anyone who is helped by it.  But I find it a tad insulting.",ptsd

But my goodness I cannot stand walking out of a test or a class and somebody laughingly joking, ""OChem is giving me PTSD."" ""I was traumatized by that exam.""

"let's talk about the physical pain we experience with PTSD This week was brutal for me, as I had severe panic attacks upon waking several times during the week. My panic attacks feel like the flu - chills, sweats, trembling, teeth chattering, body aches, and nausea (sometimes vomiting). It causes so much stress to my body that I am in severe pain for days after. 

I saw my psychiatrist yesterday and I have meds to help with my anxiety, but it got me thinking about how we don't always discuss how PTSD symptoms can manifest in ways that cause physical pain. Hypervigilance, anxiety, depression, nightmares, etc., all can wreak havoc on our bodies. I used to think I had some underlying illness or that I always was getting the flu. Now I understand how PTSD symptoms can put a great strain on my body and I try to have more self-compassion and acknowledge that my pain is real.

"My manager choked me yesterday. TW: physical assault 

For context I have been diagnosed with PTSD for years due to a couple different traumas. 

If it matters, I am female. Yesterday my boss and I were laughing about something, we joke around a lot but up until now he has never laid hands on me. He was about a foot away from me and he abruptly reached out and wrapped both his hands around my neck, squeezed and shook me. He was laughing and didn‚Äôt do it as a serious attack, but nonetheless he fully wrapped his fingers around my throat and choked me. He let go after a few seconds and was still laughing after and I was so shocked that I just nervously laughed and got away from him as soon as possible. It was not a light choke, after he did that I was sore for an hour after. 

I called his boss crying and in shock. Long story short she was PISSED and brought it to HR immediately. I was informed by her today that HR is still deciding what to do - aka, he has not been fired yet. In the meantime he is not working on Monday and I‚Äôm reporting to his boss as my manager until something is decided. 

It didn‚Äôt sink in until after I got away from him and had a moment alone just how messed up it was. I already have PTSD from several traumas and yesterday just keeps replaying in my mind over and over, I‚Äôm worried this will just be another trauma to add to the list. If he isn‚Äôt fired I‚Äôm going to be seriously scared for my safety because this is not the first time I‚Äôve reported him for inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. They are still investigating and I‚Äôve already decided that I am quitting if he is not fired. I love my job, I work in the mental health field and I deeply care for the people I support. But I refuse to feel in physical danger from my coworkers at work. 

I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about yesterday and I could use some kind words right now. :(

**Edit:** I want to thank you all for your advice. I talked to my former divorce attorney asking for recommendations for any of her colleagues who can help me if he is not fired. She was absolutely floored when I told her what happened and told me to contact her after work tomorrow so she can find representation for me if he is not fired. She said it would really be best if I have an attorney with me when I talk to HR but given that this is happening tomorrow there‚Äôs no time for that, so she advised me to record any and all interactions I have with management or HR regarding the situation and to act very carefully. In the meantime I‚Äôm taking care of myself and emotionally preparing for tomorrow.

**Edit 2:** I found out today that he has been fired. I am still shaken up but I am relieved knowing that I won‚Äôt have to face him again or feel unsafe/uncomfortable at work. I did notice bruising and swelling today and took pics which I sent to HR and I am sure that played a part in their decision as well. I‚Äôm seeing my doctor tomorrow and seeing what she recommends to make sure that I‚Äôm 100% okay. Thank you so much everyone for your support, I greatly appreciate this sub. üíô",ptsd

"I wish someone would've told me how healing running my own businesses could be... Instead everyone discouraged me because of my PTSD! + more thoughts on jobs and managing PTSD **EDIT:** Ahhh omg! My first Reddit award ü•∫!! After I posted this I had the usual PTSD self-doubt, worrying that y'all wouldn't understand, but of course YOU UNDERSTAND IT MORE THAN ANYONE!! I will be posting more here and hope to keep swapping stories and inspiration with everyone in this sub :)

&#x200B;

I have PTSD from an abusive relationship I had when I was 14-18 years old. I also have anxiety, OCD/dermatillomania, depression, and chronic pain.

I come from a family of entrepreneurs and was raised to be one. I have dabbled in a few different industries, spent a lot of time helping create and run newer nonprofits and community orgs. Now I'm working for a small tech company as a partner and I manage all my own clients, customer service, website, etc.

A couple years ago, I decided I really wanted to start my own business from the ground up, by myself. There was a few different reasons, mainly being that I wanted more freedom and ability to creative (my current work is monotonous as hell). Once I started digging further, I realized that I also wanted the freedom to live by my own schedule, and once I figured out why, it all came back to my PTSD.

As I'm sure you all know, there are days, weeks, months that are difficult to work through. Especially when you're in a company with strict attendance requirements or customer/client service. Even though I run my own stuff at my current day job, there is no flexibility when it comes to taking long breaks or avoiding customers. This can be really tricky to manage with PTSD :(

I faced a lot of discouragement when I started exploring options for businesses that I could run myself **that would also allow time for rest and recovery.** Everyone kept saying to me that ""making it"" would be impossible, too stressful, too much time, too much energy. But stubborn and determined like I always am, I kept researching a business model that I could gel with.

I paid for a lot of online courses and listened to a lot of ""experts"" who really believe they have the answer. I will admit that the haters were a little bit correct in that pursuing entrepreneurship is an energy drainer. BUT!! Through all the classes and mentorships, I learned one big fat lesson about running your own business - you have to deeply know yourself to be a successful entrepreneur. (I know everyone here struggles with knowing who your ""true"" self is... I know I do... so this lesson hit me HARD).

Why do you have to know yourself? Well, a million reasons. But the top ones - 1. You have to pick what your business is about, and in order to do that, you have to know what you like and don't like (not so easy for us w/ PTSD!!) and 2. You have to understand how you get shit done the best! Instead of following someone else's schedule and guidelines, you really have to craft your own, and in order to do that you have to kind of ""study"" yourself.

I did a lot of work and exercises related to this all in hopes of becoming a successful entrepreneur. And I realized that **a lot of that work was helping with my PTSD recovery, too.**

Anytime I disregarded my own ideas and tried someone else's because they were more successful etc., I would fail. Then I would stay true to who I am, the way I work, what I care about... and that's what worked.

Am I saying that entrepreneurship cures PTSD? Lol. Hell no. Is it a replacement for therapy and other forms of recovery? No.

BUT! As someone who has had a dream of being a successful entrepreneur my whole life - I really really really wish someone would've told me **all the healing and positive parts of having PTSD and running my own biz.** Instead of just throwing discouragement at me.

I could talk about this forever... I know this is a long post, but I wanted to share in case anyone else on here has **ever felt discouraged from pursuing self-driven or creative work.** You don't have to sit in an office all day and play by the rules. You also don't have to work a million hours and stress yourself into panic attacks. You can pursue what you want with self-care and your PTSD does NOT make it impossible. In fact, sometimes I think the resilience and stamina I have because of my PTSD *actually helps me*.

I'd be curious to hear anyone else's thoughts on careers and running a business and how their PTSD helps or hurts. Thanks for listening, I love lurking this sub and this is my first post :)",ptsd
"Trauma Is Like A Mold This analogy was told me to me when I was in an inpatient treatment facility for ptsd and it really helped me understand trauma, shame, ptsd etc. 

Trauma -and the shame it comes with- is like a mold. It grows and thrives in the dark, in closed off, damp places. Imagine mold growing in a closet in your home. You can close the door, and you won‚Äôt have to look at it or even really deal with it at all. 

The thing is, when you come back to check on it a year later, two years later, 20 years later, it won‚Äôt be the same as when you left it. It will have grown. A lot. 

Trauma is the same way. A lot of people understandably want to put off facing their trauma through therapy/treatment etc until they‚Äôre in a better place in their lives. It‚Äôs inconvenient and most people want to wait until they‚Äôre done with school or more comfortable at their new job etc etc. So a lot of people close the closet door and tell themselves it‚Äôs fine and they can look at it later when they‚Äôre more ready. 

When you come back to look at trauma later, it won‚Äôt be the same as you left it. It will have grown, a lot.

Shame and suffering grows when we hide it. It thrives off secrecy and alone-ness. The burden of hiding our pain from ourselves and others multiplies it. The burden of protecting others from our reality multiplies our shame. You will see people on this sub and in other areas of treatment who are just beginning their journey and they will say ‚ÄúI wish I dealt with this 20 years ago‚Äù. 

The way to begin addressing trauma is the same way we can begin addressing mold. We need to air it out. Open the closet and leave the door open. Let sunlight shine onto your trauma and let it be seen. We don‚Äôt have to keep it a secret anymore to protect ourselves or other people. I‚Äôve found that speaking the truth about what happened to us is the most terrifying thing in the world until it actually comes out of our mouths. The more we talk about it, the more we let the day light fall on it, the less power it will have over us.",ptsd
"Who else is so lonely that you catch yourself talking to yourself in public and replaying old conversations in your head? Who else is so lonely that you catch yourself talking to yourself in public and replaying old conversations in your head?

Yup, that‚Äôs me. I‚Äôve been pretty isolated and alone my whole life but especially since I went no contact with my abusive family. I catch myself talking and laughing to myself in public. People probably think I‚Äôm crazy. Don‚Äôt really care though, I know this is a coping mechanism so I feel less alone until I develop my chosen family. I am so bored, need excitement and crave connection. Anyone else relate?",ptsd
"Anyone else tone down your femininity/sexuality to prevent sexual abuse? Anyone else tone down your femininity/sexuality to prevent sexual abuse?

I stopped dressing feminine, wore baggy clothes, channeled my masculine energy to scare/intimidate men so I don‚Äôt get sexual attention. Yeah, I did this. And also when I was covertly sexually abused by my dad, instead of protecting me, my mom got jealous and stopped taking me to get my hair done and wouldn‚Äôt let me get my nails done even though she had originally promised. I looked unkempt growing up.

And now at 27 that I know what happened to me and have come to reality with the abuse I went through... I have no sex drive and have no interest in flirting and emitting sexual energy towards other men. Also, when I have flirted in the past, I realize I behaved like a little girl. So now I‚Äôm grossed out that men were attracted to me when I acted like a little girl, does that mean they have pedophile tendencies?

Also, I‚Äôm really intimidated by dominating and masculine men but also attracted. Like I only can be around men who exhibit feminine/passive energy right now and I get scared around dominating men who can make me submissive and thus controlled. Controlling my environment helps me feel in control and feel calmer due to my abuse history. Weird part is my abuser (dad) was actually passive and had submissive energy but was still abusive, creepy and manipulated by playing the victim. You would think I would be more scared around those types of men But I still find myself feeling safer around these kind of men over dominant because I can intimidate and scare them away by channeling masculine energy.

I am grossed out by men and don‚Äôt trust them‚Äîtoo many creeps out there who seem nice but then betray you. If I had a daughter I‚Äôd be so protective. It‚Äôs a scary world out there.

"Do not let the ‚Äúfalse memory research‚Äù of Elizabeth Loftus stop you from speaking up for yourself and other survivors Sometimes as a survivor of childhood incest (perpetrated by my ex-father) I have doubted myself for not remembering every detail that I would have remembered more as an adult. 

But I viscerally remember being a child lying in fear at night in my bed, hiding underneath my blanket, listening to every sound in the house, every footstep, hoping my ex-father wouldn‚Äôt cross the hallway to attack me. He never allowed me or my sister to lock our bedroom doors. It was almost always dark and the injuries he inflicted were internal, painful and shameful. I focused on the wall. I pretended I wasn‚Äôt there, that I was a bird, flying away. I tried to ignore, as much as possible, how my own body was betraying me. 

After family court removed him from my childhood home, I tried my best to move on. I was non-compliant with therapy. I buried the pain until they come up again when I had my first romantic relationships in college. 

But throughout my long healing journey, I have repeatedly encountered the memory research published by Elizabeth Loftus. She has used her status as a distinguished law and psychology professor to repeatedly argue adults who recall buried (‚Äúrepressed‚Äù) memories of childhood incest and sexual abuse must be ‚Äúfaking‚Äù their memories. She has used her ‚Äúlost in the mail‚Äù university psychology experiment to cast doubt on survivors‚Äô testimony, and trains other defense lawyers how to do so. She sat on the scientific advisory board of the now disbanded False Memory Syndrome Foundation. 

But I have suffered too much lifelong insomnia, nightmares, night terrors, shivers, involuntary flashbacks, fearful freezing (and other repetition compulsion behaviors including promiscuity and willingness to engage in sex work) to allow her stature in the memory research community to stop me from speaking up for myself and others. 

Today, I learned she has testified for the defense  at the trials of: Harvey Weinstein, Ghislaine Maxwell (associate of Jeffrey Epstein), Robert Durst, among many other high-profile defendants who were ultimately convicted of sexual assault or murder. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Loftus#Involvement_in_legal_cases 

Does she feel no shame whenever she uses her work to intimidate and silence survivors? Let her record speak for itself.",ptsd

My mom died suddenly on February 13th without any warning. I have already been diagnosed with ptsd but this is different and worse. 

My mom was my best friend besides my husband. My husband and I live in my now only dad‚Äôs house. 

I went in her room and I couldn‚Äôt get up or turn her over. I should‚Äôve known but I finally lifted her up up and was an inch away from her face. I hate describing it but I need people to know so they might be able to help. 

Her lips were purple, her eyes were half open, and there was stuff coming out of her right nostril. 

I ran downstairs to get my dad. I called 911. I knew there was nothing I could do. My parents had such a beautiful relationship. They only stayed in separate rooms because my mom is messy and my dad is ocd clean.

I couldn‚Äôt and still can‚Äôt believe it. There was no autopsy because my dad doesn‚Äôt want to know if he could‚Äôve done something. He‚Äôs been a wreck. I have told him about these flashes and he said it was my ptsd. 

It‚Äôs never been this bad before. Before my mom I had nightmares, anxiety, fear, and some rare flashbacks. Now the flashbacks happen multiple times daily. I‚Äôm afraid to even see a picture of my mom who I can‚Äôt say enough was my best friend. We always said I love you daily. 


My dad thinks if I talk to her beloved sponser of over 12 years ( she was sober 16 years) that I‚Äôll feel some relief. I know my mom would want it, I am just scared I‚Äôll lose it on the phone.

"Never Ask A Survivor Why They Didn't Leave Sooner If you‚Äôre a survivor, chances are you have been victim blamed/shamed. In the past when it came to sexual assault, it was often the woman that was blamed for ‚Äúasking for it.‚Äù I recall reading a book called ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Buy My Love‚Äù that talked about the influence of advertisements. There was a specific rape case where the judge ruled that the woman asked for it simply because the brand of her underwear was Victoria‚Äôs Secret. Now, we are finally holding men accountable for sexual assault, but why not for abuse? There is a stereotype that low income or minority females are too ‚Äúuneducated‚Äù to not leave. This is false. Abuse can happen to ANYONE of any social class or ethnicity. Abuse is rarely shown right away. I‚Äôm sure if we saw it in the first week we would have run but that simply isn‚Äôt how it works, especially in narcissistic abuse. There is a ‚Äúlove bombing‚Äù or ‚Äúgolden period‚Äù that can last up to a year or more where the narc acts perfectly, the change in their behavior starts slowly and is a brainwash process that has us hold onto the love bomb period in the hopes of them being capable of being that way again. Once brainwash is complete, abuse is the new normal and the voice in your head telling you something wrong is still there but yet you feel trapped to leave. I‚Äôve learned a lot about this type of abuse from this account \*\*@he\_never\_hit\_me\_but\*\* dedicated narcissistic abuse survivors. The handle alone makes me feel validated since I was never hit. Never let anyone judge you for not leaving right away. Leaving is a process and often involves extensive planning to be able to do it safely. No one understands your reality unless they‚Äôve been through it themselves.

"I often associate living with a disability to playing a videogame.

I love playing video games. I have a brain injury and I am bad at playing them. **The only way I get to** *enjoy* **playing games**, is by **playing them on Easy Mode with accessibility options enabled**. And that's how my life has to look, too, and there are always going to be people who tell me I'm **""cheating"" at life or ""taking shortcuts""** instead of taking steps to **enable my life to be enjoyable to me**.

And ultimately, when you drill down to what these people are really saying, these are people who believe that **life shouldn't be enjoyable.** These are people who don't prioritize enjoyment, hobbies, happiness, and wellbeing for themselves and so they certainly don't accept you prioritizing that for yourself. 

I've already been through enough combat. Enough violence. Enough heartbreak and literal, legal torture. The accommodations that we need as human beings with a pervasive *disorder of stress*, is to do our best to minimize the amount of stress we experience on a daily basis.

"Rhetoric about victims and survivors is so out of touch it hurts I'm sorry, but after the horror I've had to live through, this gibberish about being a survivor and not a victim is ridiculous.

I try to explain my self to ""professionals"", as someone who has actually LIVED through real violence, and they end up debating with me the semantics of how THEY understand events THEY have never lived through. 

Why the fuck am I paying  these people $100 an hour to debate with me the verbiage regarding events they don't even bother to try and understand?

Why am I defending the validity of MY pain and MY experiences against the perceptions some asshole with a 2 year certification read in a fucking abnormal psych book - a book I've also read. Books written by out of touch researches at an ""ivory tower"" research lab, who see the world through the myopic lens of diseases and pathology? 

Why am I paying to be told I'm the problem because I don't see things as divided according to some artificial binary between ""survivors"" and ""victims"". Man, there are just people - people who've seen shit and suffer.

"For everyone who manages their depression with exercise‚ÄîI compiled a comprehensive list of simple bodyweight exercises to do if we have to quarantine and the gyms get shut down again. If you're anything like me, you've managed your depression with exercise for awhile and once the gyms closed down last year, it really messed everything up. Personally, I fell back into a deep depression (it was as if I suddenly stopped taking antidepressants!), turned to food and alcohol for comfort, gained 60lbs and did virtually no exercise since the gyms were closed, and didn't even know where to start other than jogging and simple things like squats.

That's why I created a full document of bodyweight exercises that require little or no equipment to help keep us all from backsliding harder if/when we have to quarantine again. Most of them can be effective even if done just a few minutes a day in your bedroom (for those of us who have trouble getting out of bed on those bad days). And I'm sure we all know how sore and stiff our muscles feel when we spend all day laying around.

This list is complete with Cardio, Bodyweight exercises, Mobility, and Stretching. I referenced videos on all of the things I figured most laypeople might not know about. I also included links for the optional equipment for both Amazon and Non-Amazon resources.

If you have any suggestions on anything else to add, I'll gladly keep building on the list! I know a lot of us use exercise to manage depression and when we can't, it becomes a vicious cycle of not having motivation to exercise and then not having any serotonin because you didn't exercise lol

I hope this helps at least a few of you. Let's adapt and conquer this time around, friends. Remember, even a few minutes helps!

"I'm about done with EMDR, and I've come to a realization with my PTSD. I've had a hard life. Especially in my childhood. 

I know everyone has a different story. My story is a childhood of being told I was not good enough. Being told I was stupid. Then I was assaulted when I was still naive and did not understand the world yet.

EMDR showed me that my trauma was complex. In fact, so complex, it's almost incurable. I've made some progress- but when your childhood is a decade of being told you aren't good enough, being mentally abused, then physically by others- it's just, hard.

I'm never going to completely give up, but as a 30 year old man now, I know that I just have to make good with what I've  been given. I'll always have to carry a childhood of trauma around with me wherever I go. 

But EMDR has showed me that I can somewhat deal with the pain in a different manner, healthy, and more constructive. I try so hard to tell myself and the hurt parts of myself I am worth more than what I was given ages ago.

It's a bittersweet truth, but I've made some progress. I used to actively hurt myself because I was so used to others hurting me and telling me I was not good enough. I don't do that anymore.",ptsd

"Does anyone else feel like they overcame their PTSD, and then just have a meltdown/episode/panic attack out of nowhere? I noticed that since the beginning of the year, I would have these on and off meltdowns/episodes/panic attacks. I would cry all night after, shaking and trembling, while my husband would hold me and try to console me. The next day I would usually feel fine and even enlightened, and I would write down some new insights about myself or the world. I would feel like I've finally overcome my PTSD and that I won't breakdown again. Then a few weeks later I would have one negative thought, then talk it out with my husband, and next thing I know, I'm having panic attacks again. 

I have panic attacks at least once a month I'd say, coupled with a sleepless night full of crying, shaking and self-loathing, and sometimes suicidal thoughts. Most of the time though I think I feel fine and even positive about healing...then it turns out I'm not.",ptsd

"I'm 24. Two years ago my girlfriend (soon to be finance) and I wrecked and she passed. I suffered severe injuries and still haven't recovered and the PTSD from this night stops me from doing anything. I don't know what I can do. I feel guilty and I feel remorse and I just feel awful everyday. Ever since this accident happened my life has gone downhill. I dropped out of college in my last semester, moved in with my parents, and haven't done anything since. I just can't even leave bed and all of my friendships and relationships fail so I'm constantly alone. I don't even care about waking up anymore and every night I relive that accident. I have severe PTSD and my therapist just tells me to stop it. I don't know how I can stop it. I got pain killers when I got out of the accident and I've been addicted to them ever since. I can't stop taking them and I don't even want to but they're my only way to cope. I just feel hopeless and have no idea what to do. That one night ruined my entire life and I feel like she's the lucky one. 

She was just completely smashed when the car flipped and my bottom half of my body was as well. The images from this night are in my head at all times and I revisit this accident probably a dozen times a day. If something reminds me of this night then I just shutdown and try to get to the ground so I can curl up, plug my ears, and let it pass. It's happened in restaurants and I can't cope with it. I just can't deal with these images and events being replayed in my head. It is a true nightmare. One time the song that was playing when we wrecked came on randomly and I fell to the ground and essentially blacked out like I was having a seizure. I don't know how I can stop this from happening at this point. It's been two years and it seems like they're getting worse. 

We weren't even that drunk and because of a stupid fucking mistake she's gone and my life is miserable. We made this mistake and paid a cost beyond belief and I don't know how what we did was justifiable of these reprocussions. We had wine is all, with dinner. I wasn't even classified over the DUI requirement that night.",ptsd
"I realised today that I like myself! For the first time, in.. well, ever.

I'm not sure exactly what changed or when. But today, after I did something dumb (I don't remember what, something insignificant like walking into the door frame), the inner monologue said something like 'it's okay, I like myself'. 

It stopped me in my tracks - I don't remember ever thinking that before. I took a moment to look in the mirror and see myself from a positive, more objective perspective; not just in my appearance, but in the person I am.

And I am here to tell you, kids, that I saw it all, and I liked it. I didn't see some dumb, fat, dropout loser like my brain tries to portray me as. 

Instead I saw beauty. I saw a compassionate, weird, creative, fierce woman, who suffered trauma upon trauma but somehow overcame. Who even in the lowest points of her own life has never turned away a person in need. Who continues to grow and evolve into better versions of herself every day.

I'm telling you this partly because I'm proud of myself and wanna show off a little, but mostly because I want anyone and everyone out there who's struggling with themselves, to know that it's possible. It's not just something people say to make you feel better; it's real and it's attainable.

"A TMI success but one I haven't had in a while I have PTSD due to being violently drugged, kidnapped and raped in college. My boyfriend and I have had lows in our relationship sexually because of this. Most times I have flashbacks because he does something small that triggers me and idk how to explain it to him so I act like nothings wrong but he knows. Today before we had sex we talked about it. We discussed for 30 minutes everything we wanted to do and I told him everything I could think of that made me uncomfortable and I had the best sex of my life. It's a small success to some but being able to be intimate with my partner without fear of my ptsd and how it may seem to him is a huge step for me and I am happy to be able to have sex for the first time without any kind of trigger or fear. Normally I dont tell him during sex if I'm triggered but he can tell and he stops anyways. Today we had sex after 3 years of dating that was just us. No ptsd. Just us and I feel like I made so much progress. It just feels so good to know my rapist has no control over that part of my life anymore and that my intimacy with my partner sexually can develope more now.",ptsd

"Does anyone else have a bit of a staring problem (hypervigilance) that was developed due to PTSD when around people/crowds? Like it almost feels you are the predator in a way since you keep your eyes on people and their movements? My traumatic experiences have caused me to become very hyper aware and vigilant. My eyes follow and observe people like a hawk  so I stay ""safe"" and avoid such people who I feel will hurt me again(which in my case translates to everyone). But the thing is I believe everyone is a threat, so my eyes follow and watch everybody through my peripheral vision beyond my control. As if my subconscious is taking over and shutting down what I can control in the present time. The thing is having this issue is nearly destroying my life. I will literally stare everybody down until they are out of my eyesight lol, I have caused hostility, frustration, and creeped out people, but its like my animal brain doesnt care or listen to me or their responses. Its incredibly difficult if not impossible to be in a classroom (it making me really want to drop out) because I am more focused on the people around me than the teacher/board. People notice this and I make them incredibly nervous because of it. I cant speak or relax in group setting since my eyes will dart around scanning the environment, as if I am still in danger.

I‚Äôll never forget the day I found out.. my dad woke me up from a nap and said ‚Äúyour sister is missing and your niece was found dead.‚Äù I froze in time and blacked out for a few weeks. It was all over the news and life just didn‚Äôt feel real. A few years later came the trial. I saw pictures of my niece how she was found and it‚Äôs forever burned into my brain.

I think about her death multiple times a day.

A few days ago, I was delivering food for Uber eats and didn‚Äôt realize the address until I got on the street. I look down at my phone, and I just so happened to deliver the food to the new residents in house my niece was murdered in. I hadn‚Äôt been there since it happened.

"Therapist says I don't have PTSD because you can only get it from SA or threat of death. What the title says. I think I need to switch therapists. She is good in a lot of ways but tells me that I merely self diagnosed myself with PTSD and that it is not possible for me to have it unless I was sexually assaulted or was threatened with death. She doubts a diagnosis of PTSD I received from a psychiatrist. Even after I tell her about my flashbacks, nightmares, hyperarousal and everything else, she continues to reiterate that I need to stop self diagnosing myself. I don't know how to feel because when she says this to me it makes me feel uneasy but I have no idea if she's telling me the right thing or not. She does EMDR and specializes in trauma therapy so I'm just not sure why she seems to completely disregard all of my symptoms..

Edit: just to be clear I'm not mad solely about the fact she's not agreeing about me having PTSD. It's because I think it's infinitely helpful to say I have PTSD because it encompasses all of the confusing symptoms that I didn't quite know how to explain before. Part of it feels like she just doesn't believe that I'm telling the truth. I think she's a little bitter because everything she tries to tell me is something I already know. I told her about my misophonia and she didn't even know what it was. Then she proceeded to cutely say ""Oh I think I have that too! I can't stand people chewing!"" I just sit there kind of in awe at not only how irrelevant that is but how invalidating it seemed. Nobody likes the noise of chewing.

My boyfriend (now ex) broke up with me the other night after I told him that I ran into the man who sexually abused me throughout my childhood when I went to visit my hometown. I didn‚Äôt ask for comfort, I just wanted to be transparent and texted to let him know what happened and how I was feeling. I told him he didn‚Äôt have to do anything or say anything, but that it was really jarring seeing the man again after so many years. I‚Äôve actively been in therapy and been taking medication for the last 2.5 years. I‚Äôve told him about my trauma before and what happened - he was aware. 

He told me that hearing about this run-in made him realize that if we become more serious or get married in the future, that my trauma would ‚Äúbecome [his] problem,‚Äù and he doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúbe a part of that.‚Äù 

I asked for so little from him. He had been upset that I don‚Äôt open up to him as much literally the week before so I tried to open up and let him in, and he broke up with me over it. 

I feel so helpless. I can‚Äôt control what happened to me, and he basically just left because of the trauma. If it was currently affecting the relationship or if I was mentally in a bad place or not seeking treatment, I could have understand- but it feels he left me purely over the fact that it happened to me and is a part of my life story. I feel so disgusted with myself. I just wish all over again that the abuse didn‚Äôt happen to me.

"A spiritual leader just shamed me after I set a boundary saying I did not feel comfortable discussing my childhood sexual abuse! Wtf! A spiritual leader just shamed me after I set a boundary saying I did not feel comfortable discussing my childhood sexual abuse! Wtf!

So I did a virtual appointment with two spiritual people who guide plant medicine spiritual sessions for healing. My main purpose was to ask them more about how they could help me and the different types of Spiritual ceremonies they hold. I spent over one hundred dollars to get more information about them and they barely answered my questions.

First, they ask me about why I am looking to work with the medicine. I tell them childhood sexual, racial and mental trauma. Then I tell them how I am looking for safe spaces because unfortunately I've been getting preyed on by predators in these spaces. He asks for more details about the predator experience and asks if the predator flirted with me. I briefly summarize what happened then change the subject by discussing some of the positives of the past spiritual events I went to. Then he keeps asking me for more details about the trauma and my intentions, but I continue to give vague answers because This spiritual healing work is pretty personal, independent and you actually don't need to tell your guides the specifics of your trauma. He kept pushing and I tell them I don't feel comfortable sharing my childhood sexual abuse especially because I just met them and this work is personal and knowing the details of my trauma is not necessary. I ask them what is their purpose of wanting to know? They say ""it will help him figure out what intentions I should set and what ceremonies are best for me."" He continues pushing and asks if I have a therapist? I tell him that I've been in therapy for years and also have a degree in psychology/counseling.

Then he says we are just souls that pick up stories (trauma).. So then why was he so persistent of hearing about my trauma when he is saying it doesn't matter so much?! 

 They wasted my time, it was obvious they hadn't read the form I was told to complete beforehand for them because he said ""next time you will have to fill out the form and we will discuss what ceremonies are best for you."" I told them ""I already filled out the form and did they read it?"" Then the female leader was like oh yes. Obviously they didn't otherwise they wouldn't have been asking questions that  were already answered on there. Then he kept filling up the time with random psychological information (and he is not a trauma trained individual) about our brain being stuck in child trauma.. it's like they were just trying to fill up time because they were unprepared. Then he tries to tell me I am not allergic to mushrooms and it is just anxiety. He was acting like he was all knowing and knew what was best for me and he had just met me! 

He told me to stop being logical and get in touch with my intuition. When I told them I would want to do the healing work in women spaces due to my trauma, he said he couldn't change himself into a woman.. so basically Id be stuck with him as a guide.

Then he tells me I need to work on surrendering because I am hyperprotective. I told him I did struggle with surrendering and he asked why. I said it was hard to give up control because of past trauma. He said control is all a perception and I needed to surrender.

He tells me predators I've been harassed by recently have been attracted to my energy due to my struggle of surrendering. He says ""everyone has childhood trauma and you shouldn't come to just take.. When you come to group meetings, you need to open up and give and take.. you should come with a nonjudgmental ear."" He tells me he doesn't think I am ready for a spiritual ceremony soon and that I need to do gentle things like yoga and find small ways to surrender. He says next time I come I have to be willing to share everything about me. WTH!!! So I am being ""judgemental and just taking"" because I set boundaries and don't want to unnecessarily share my childhood trauma to strangers?! Notice how they are using ""surrender"" to push boundaries?!

How disappointing that he tried to shift the blame on me when they were the ones who were unprepared and prying personal information by pushing boundaries! I feel mad and triggered. He shamed me for setting and sticking with my boundary. I also feel proud because I've come so far that I set and stick to my boundaries. The fact that someone is telling me I need to open up tells me I've progressed because I used to be called an open book! Not everyone gets the privilege of knowing my trauma...that may come once trust is established.

ugh!! Validation and support would be nice, thank you.",ptsd

"I ate Crunch Berries. TW: Child Abuse (but no detailed descriptions) 

I was severely abused by my father as a child. I haven't had any contact since I'm 8 years old. One odd memory that always stood out to me was how he'd eat Captain Crunch every single morning. Out of a white mixing bowl with a serving spoon. I remember being really little and watching him do it and I swore off ever trying Captain Crunch (or any variety of it). (I wasn't allowed to eat ""his food"" back then so never tried it with him.) I didn't want to be anything like him or have anything in common, down to his taste in cereal. 

It also happens to be one of my husband's favorite cereals but when we started dating I explained why I don't eat it and he stopped eating it too. The other day he called from the store and said they had a version of just the berries that looked like stars and were only red, white, and blue. It would taste the same but look completely different. I told him he could get it and that maybe I'd even try it. I did. It's delicious. It kind of tastes like Trix. I told him that maybe when this box runs out I'd try regular Crunch Berries and that I'd like to work my way up to actual Captain Crunch. 

I'm not like my father because I ate Crunch Berries. I'm like my husband. And my son (I'm 24 weeks pregnant currently!) will probably like it one day too. And I also found out my sister has tried and loves it. It's just a good cereal and I'm glad my brain has finally realized it doesn't have anything to do with that monster.

"[TW (Child) SA] It did not happen for a reason. I am sick and tired of this phrasing. 

I've seen this a lot all over reddit when talking about trauma, especially when religious people enter the conversation: ""Everything happens for a reason.""

I refuse to believe that there is any reason in this world for a child to be r*ped repeatedly over multiple years. I refuse to believe that my suffering had a purpose and it therefore was a bit of a good thing. 

I was not. It did not have a purpose. Bad things happen to people who don't deserve it for no reason and I can live with that. And don't come with the whole ""Your trauma made you strong"" nonsense. 
Yes, maybe it did make me strong retrospectively, but before that it made me miserable, hurt, scared, ashamed and broken during a time where I deserved to be carefree and happy. I would want these people to look at a picture of three-year-old me and tell that little girl: ""What is happening to you right now has a purpose and it's how things are supposed to be"".
See if they still have the guts to do it then. 

I should add that I have had a great therapist and managed to overcome major CPTSD within a year after delayed post-amnesial onset. I am doing extemely well in my day to day life and I am currently pursuing my dreams without major setbacks. 

But hell, I am allowed to be angry and sad that this had to happen to me. I don't have to go to Church to understand why it did, I was abused because there are some terrible people in this world and it's not always possible to recognize them at first glance.

I don‚Äôt take pride in my trauma or PTSD, but I hate that, because tons of people are jumping on the bandwagon, it makes it seem that my actual PTSD which I earned the old fashioned way (by experiencing a traumatic event that was listed in the DSM-V) is just ‚Äòa trend‚Äô and not real, substantial and horrific.

"After a long time of feeling frustrated by lack of progress in therapy, I finally told my therapist something that turned it all around Disclaimer: I began therapy less than a year ago and have only ever been to one therapist, so my experience is very limited. I have no idea if this will help others or apply to anyone else's situation, but since reading it would have helped me, I thought I'd give it a shot.

For the longest time I felt like my therapist basically chatted with me, gave me compliments (telling me how strong I was, etc) and just told me what I wanted to hear. This made me angry and so many times I would leave our sessions thinking ""I don't need compliments, I need *help!*"" I could tell I wasn't getting anywhere, but everyone I talked to who had been to therapy kept telling me that it takes time and I just needed to be patient.

I got so frustrated that I was one session away from switching to someone else. I worked up my courage a little bit, went into the session, and said ""I'm frustrated with my lack of progress. I feel like you are treating me carefully, like I am fragile and ready to break at a moment's notice. Telling me I'm strong makes me feel good temporarily, but then I leave and I'm still in this deep black hole. I need you to push me out of my comfort zone. I need to know, is there a way I can make faster progress?""

Stupidly, I was afraid this would somehow offend her. Instead, without batting an eye, she simply said ""Yes. We can delve deeper into your trauma and start getting into the heavy stuff. That is the fastest way for you to make progress. I wasn't sure if you were ready."" For the rest of that session and for subsequent sessions, she completely changed her whole demeanor/approach. And let me tell you, it was (and continues to be) so, so shitty. It's been hard. But I'm in a better place, I can feel the sadness slowly lifting, and I actually feel like I'm making progress now. 


I'm so glad I didn't switch therapists before saying that. It almost didn't even occur to me as a thing I should say. To everyone out there, whether you're in the same boat or not, I wish you good luck <3

 I never thought I‚Äôd be bothered by it that much until this morning when I saw a tweet of someone saying how they think they have PTSD from having friendships where they were too much of the ‚Äúnice friend‚Äù. And it got all these retweets and replies from people relating to it because they‚Äôve had similar experiences of being wronged by friends. And it rubbed me the wrong way. That people get to say shit like they have PTSD when they really don‚Äôt. It rubbed me the wrong way, After spending a sleepless night crying and screaming having to have my husband cradle and console me all night because of the flashbacks. Wanting for it to stop and having no solution except wanting to rip the skin off my body. Hearing my husband say ‚Äúit will pass‚Äù over and over and trying desperately to believe him and knowing it will but it doesn‚Äôt help make the pain any unbearable.

The male doctor gave me complete control of how much sedation I wanted and said he‚Äôs worked with patients with PTSD before and fully understood my concerns. He was actually really kind and soothed my anxiety a lot. He had the female nurses put blankets over me and tuck them under me so I would feel more secure. I ended up being okay and agreeing to go under general anesthesia since the procedure was a little more complicated and painful than most wisdom teeth procedures.

"I'm trying not to get PTSD. I held a man's hand while he died last night. I've only had a couple hours of sleep since this happened almost 24 hours ago to the minute. I was at a rodeo and the spectators had mostly left but all the cowboys and cowgirls were doing their last runs, it was much quicker than the show but I stayed because I was enjoying the whole thing so much. My son and dog had luckily just gone home. It was our first rodeo. The crowd left because it was hot and a storm was rolling in, lighting had start but it looked to be miles away and the thunder wasn't loud. It started to sprinkle but hey it's cooling us off so they keep going. Next thing I know the biggest thickest lightning bolt hits very close, I've never heard anything so loud. I paused and then we heard yelling and I just ran that direction faster than I've ever ran. A man was laying on his back, he was struck by lightning. It was so dark over there..he was near the horse trailers. An older man started CPR and he was yelling ""it's Tom it's Tom"" (not his real name) I said I can take over when you're tired just let me know as I knelt down to feel for a pulse, he didn't have one, I continued feeling for a pulse while holding his hand saying stay with us Tom we're here with you, help is right there. I saw his wedding band and I said what's his wife's name I'll find her and someone said she's not here his daughter Katie is here she's on a horse. Then the man asked me to take over, I did a few compressions and by that time the ambulance made its way there and the paramedics took over. The older gentleman left to gather his family and animals and I assume just get to safety. By this time it's pouring and the paramedics are doing CPR so I went back to holding his hand telling him he wasn't alone and Katie is alright. The paramedics had me grab a towel from the ambulance to keep the rain out of his mouth while they tried the defibrillators. I could smell and taste burnt even before they used them. My phone is ruined because it fell out of my pocket and it was raining, but I honestly think it's acting more like it's fried from the electricity. It keeps posting this before I'm finished typing. I have played Tetris multiple times. I didn't find out the outcome until this afternoon and he did pass. I still randomly smell and taste it in my sinuses. I just don't know what to think, I've only heard of this kind of thing. His daughter is only 18 and his son is only a couple years older than her. He was a veterinarian. I'm sure he was a special man. No one deserves to die alone in the mud. I just wish the outcome were different. ",ptsd

I‚Äôm just unable to actually sleep. I‚Äôll wake up due to nightmares, random feelings of dread or at the smallest sound of rain and what not. I‚Äôm actually not a light sleeper, I‚Äôm just unable to sleep. 

I hate needing background noise to sleep. I hate having to put a night light on. I hate waking up feeling more tired than I did before sleeping. I hate not being able to sleep a full night.

"I let my mom have it today and it felt fucking awesome! So, last time I was supposed to do EMDR therapy I told my therapist I didn‚Äôt want to because the previous session had made me very angry with my mom. Well, my therapist absolutely laid into my mom, I‚Äôve never heard someone say those things about her before but they are so damn true. She also said that out of all of her patients who have troubles with their mother MINE IS THE WORST!!

She said I grew up with a narcissistic mother and was a victim of serious neglect. Not really knowing the depth of either of those I did some digging and yeah, emotional and physical neglect and for sure narcissistic mother. My therapist also told me that my mother has never offered me a true apology for what happened and owned her misdeeds.

I called her this morning and laid everything my therapist said out, gave her all of the clinical examples of physical and emotional neglect and told her the markers of a narcissistic parent. She said I don‚Äôt know how many times I can say sorry. I asked her if she could own up to any of the abuse she inflicted on me and she absolutely denied everything and I told her until she owns up to it we are done talking and hung up.

That means no contact with her only grandchild. It feels good to finally say, no you own your mistakes, I have a fucking right to be angry and sorry isn‚Äôt enough anymore.",ptsd

My boyfriend always brings up the time I was raped. He uses it as an insult almost trying to play it off like I cheated on him or something.

I don‚Äôt want to be raped again. I also don‚Äôt want to be miserable for the rest of my life. It just feels like I‚Äôm trying to move past my rape. But he keeps dragging me back to it, blaming me for it, purposefully triggering me and making me panic so he gets his own way.

When he dosent want me to go somewhere he‚Äôll put his hands on my neck in a choking type of way and say things like ‚Äúyou want this to happen again ? It will happen if you leave the house‚Äù

He dosent choke me but he puts his hands there cause he knows it triggering enough to make me panic so I‚Äôll stay at the house like he wants me too.

It feels disgusting to know I told my boyfriend details of my rape because I thought he‚Äôd be the one to help me overcome my fear. Instead he knows that hands on my neck will scare me so he does it on purpose to get what he wants.

"Who else here has problems with concentration and memory Where to start?

I want to start my story with the problem. 5 years ago I had a child. She had stomach problems so she kept me up for hours at night. That's hard obviously. I was exhausted. I've always had problems with concentration and memory. But after I had my first baby... I felt I was losing my mind. I could not do the simplest task like grocery shopping, let alone my job. most importantly I failed my child as a mother. I also had a lot and physical pain, after being misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia I did fasiatherapie. Which did wonders! Really. I am almost pain free. But I still felt like I was losing my mind.

I went to a special unit consisting of doctors but also a psychologist. They found  nothing physical wrong with me, the psychologist diagnosed me with PTSD.

I wanted to get better so badly, for my child. I 'confused' to my biggest secret, even though I did not really want to talk about it. I was molested for years by my grandfather. I don't remember when it started,  my first memories I think I was 5 but i think it was going on longer then that. It stopped when I was 11 and he died when I was 12.

I remember flashes, my memory of my trauma is fragmented. The psychologist said all of my concentration and memory problems are a result of repressing memories for almost 2 decades. She said, the only way to get better is to talk about it with the help of EMDR. 

I really tried but my mind resists to the point of fainting. I was pregnant at the time and the psychologist opted not to push me. But the therapy seemed pointless to both of us after a few sessions.

I don't know what to do now. I work part-time out of necessity. If I get to tired, I can't remember anything and I can't concentrate on anything.

I just had covid and am extremely tired, even working part time. My colleagues don't know about my mental health, I don't feel safe talking to them. They just keep saying to 'think positive'. When I mention PTSD they laugh and say that's what soldiers have, so I just drop it. My husband does support me. He's an angel. He is so patience, i'm so grateful.

I thought I'd share this both because I could use the support and because I think people may find solace in knowing that others share their struggles even at an older age.

I'm in my early 40's, and a father. This past week I blocked my mother's phone and all of her social media contacts. She abused me physically and mentally over the course of my childhood. She even helped cover up the sexual abuse of one of her boyfriends. All so she could continue getting a child support check. Throughout adulthood I still kept in touch, even though almost every conversation revolved around either shaming me for my life's choices, or begging me to assure her that she was a good parent. 

After finally convincing myself (with the help of my therapist) that I needed to just cut all ties, it still took me several days to block her on different platforms. A part of me kept waiting for her to notice, but nothing ever happened. It's been a week, and I'm both glad I finally took steps to cut all ties and scared of her potential reaction.

"My therapist ended our services together today, even though we both acknowledged my high support needs My therapist, who I've been seeing for over a year now, dumped me as a client. I've had this happen before. Once it was because my provider stopped taking my insurance, once it was because my provider was moving- both times I had a heads up. 

Today, my former therapist told me that she's not suitable to treat me and that I should find someone new. This was after expressing my disturbing experience from a recent medication withdrawal to her just last week, as well as expressing my dismay in not being able to access residential care. These are both indicative of a person having high support needs. 

Instead of ending our services in a professional, reasonable manner, she was audibly frustrated enough to blurt out that she ""obviously isn't much help"" and won't be making any more appointments with me. I said something along the lines of ""so you're going to just remove the services I DO have? With no help to arrange anything else?  Do you know how long waiting lists in this area are?"" and she pretty much alluded to ""yeah, you can call the office of the practice and see if anyone else is available."" 

I called the front office and explained that I need a new trauma informed therapy provider and the receptionist told me they don't allow switching providers within the office. (Uh, okay.) I defeatedly said ""okay"" and ended the call shortly after. They, however, arranged further access to their office by talking to the president of the practice, who instructed them to find me someone else. I have an appointment next week with the new person.

Then calling a friend, getting her to stop by yours before she gets there to take your gift and lie for you by saying I had to work (night shift, I'm a nurse).

Then, spending the evening beating yourself up for missing yet another event, ruminating on what they're doing, what they're talking about and the memories they're making without you. Knowing it's just a matter of time till everyone finally stops inviting you to things.

"Happy rant: I had sex without having a panic attack, crying, or dissociating! CW: Sexual assault/abuse, pedophilia, panic attacks

I am so happy and just proud of myself in general. I was molested and sexually abused as a kid, and it left me with a lot of emotional scars. I get flashbacks and panic attacks a lot, and even in a safe, consentual environment if someone touches my genitals I have always either started crying or dissociated. 

I've been on tinder lately and I met this really sweet woman (lets call her Stephanie) and we sent each other memes for a couple days. We decided to meet up for coffee and we talked for hours about music, spirituality, art, being gay (we're both women), and we really hit it off. We went to the book store and then played video games at target, and then we went to a park. We kissed at the park and her lipstick got all over my face and we laughed at each other and I felt really comfortable with her. We decided to go to her house to watch a movie.

Long story short we cuddled for a bit and then ended up having sex! It was really weird actually feeling comfortable enough to express myself like that with someone. I didn't even have a glimpse of a flashback. This probably sounds super lame but I'm really, really proud of myself. I feel like this was a huge step in healing from my trauma and allowing myself to exist beyond what happened to me as a kid. I feel like one of the reasons why I felt so comfortable was because we talked a lot about boundaries and stuff beforehand, and I mentioned that I'd been sexually assaulted in the past and that I might need to stop if I start freaking out, and she was really understanding and sweet and always really communicative. Stephanie and I both agreed that we should definitely go on a second date. I'm just really happy and gay and proud of myself and Stephanie is really cute that is all",ptsd

"Every since my girlfriend died in front of me, I haven't been the same. I saw the love of my life fall head first, down a 300ft cliff... She got knocked out instantly and tumbled for 200ft and then fell off another cliff (50ft)and landed on sharp rocks...

I tried to rescue her and almost fell off the cliff as well, I knew I had to get down there as fast as possible because I was afraid she fell unconscious into the ocean, and I wanted to keep her head above water. Time was of the essence but it was impossible to get down there with out killing myself in the process. I knew that and I had to make the horrible decision to stay on top of the cliff, call 911 and let her drown.

There was nothing I could have done differently, the firefighters got there with in 10 minutes and they started searching for her body, meanwhile the police started interrogating me and I got the impression they thought I pushed her off the cliff. Everyone told me they were looking for her corpse, which reinforced the idea that she was dead.  I even thought I saw her body in the water at one point. I couldn't stop crying, I was hyperventilating, screaming, and I was pretty much hysterical... essentially, it was a pure nightmare.

I kept telling myself ""I need to wake up, I need to wake up, please just wake up, this can't be real!""

I didn't know why it was happening to me, all I wanted was to go 20 minutes back in time.
I couldn't understand why we were ok and laughing 20 minutes earlier, and then all the sudden, she was dead and I was never gonna see her again. It was an extremely difficult thing to process and I was completely in denial.
She was the most amazing woman I had ever met in my entire life, she was beautiful, smart, she was a critical thinker and she was even working on having her own ted talk about consciousness and quantum physics. She was smart but also fun to be around, we cracked jokes all day long and the 2 of us were just goofballs most of the time. I honestly couldn't believe how happy we were together all the time, it was almost like a dream, We even talked about getting married.

Three helicopters were there, the press was there, but ultimately a police drone found her. She was alive, and waving at the drone.
The firefighters were able to get her back up by using a crane and multiple ropes.
Her face was so bloody I could only see the white part of her eyes. 
I wanted to talk to her but the cops were blocking me because they still thought I tried to kill her.(I didn't)

They wouldn't even let me see her at the hospital for 2 days!
The cops asked her if I pushed her off the cliff, she said no and then I was able to see her... It was harsh, they shaved her head and there were so many sutures all over her scalp... She stayed in the hospital for almost 2 months. Fast forward 15 months and she's now able to walk again and has somewhat of a normal life, she still has brain damage from the fall, and we can't really do much anymore. We used to party every week end but we can't do that anymore, which breaks my heart, but at least she's still alive.

I want to get to the point, here is why I'm telling this story:

Ever since it happened, I keep thinking she's going to die at any moment. Every time she gets in a car or walks down the street, I think she's gonna get run over or stabbed by homeless people.
When she's eating I think she's gonna choke to death, also because she does choke a lot since her accident.( Personally I have almost choked to death 7 years ago and someone saved my life by doing the hemleich manoeuver on me.)
And every time she chokes I think she's going to die if she chokes alone someday and I'm not there to do the heimlich manoeuver on her and save her.

She took an uber to the doctor today and I'm terrified the uber is gonna crash the car and kill her. When I sleep with her I wake up in panic and check to see if she's still breathing...
I think about the accident all the time, and the way I felt when I realized she was dead.
It was the worst I had ever felt in my life, I felt so broken, and alone. I couldn't even tell her how broken and how sad I was.
It really left a mark, I haven't been the same since. And she hasn't been the same either, it's almost like the person I knew died, in some way.

I still feel like the girl I loved is still at the bottom of that cliff...

Anyway, thank you for reading, english isn't my first language.. thank you for bearing with me.

I would love to stop living in fear, I'm just not as innocent and naive as I used to be, I know the universe can take away everything that I love in an instant, and that terrifies me.
I don't want to live in fear for the rest of my life...

"Why were 25+ year olds hanging out with a 16 year old? I was told I was so mature for my age. I would hang out with people 25+ years old and often have sex with or be assaulted by them. It boggles my mind- I'm 21 and I cannot for the life of me imagine being even 21 hanging out with a 16 yr old boy, let alone me being 25+?!

"Who else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern? Who else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern?

I really liked this quote:
""Adults addicted to their own stress hormones were once  children who lived in unpredictable environments of overreaction, rage spirals, and fear. Healing is becoming conscious to when we unconsciously seek chaos, why we do it, and how often. With this awareness we can teach our bodies safety in the present."" -Dr. Nicole LePera https://www.instagram.com/p/CRuA4LrACjc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

I notice when things get calm, I often will seek out chaos, look for problems or purposely trigger myself by thinking, reading or looking at things that have traumatized me. The I find myself in a trauma vortex where I keep triggering myself everytime I start getting calm. This dysregulated state excites and arouses me. It is familiar and makes me feel less bored. I have an underlying fear of getting better, fear of change, fear of getting my hopes up for it all to go bad again, and an underlying root belief that I don't deserve happiness and love because I am bad and unlovable.

Who else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern? How do you cope and stop yourself from going down that path? Also... Ugh doesn't it suck?? I feel like I am getting in my own way if healing even though I know it is deeper than that and I have to be patient.",ptsd

"Who else had to unlearn normalizing and being flattered by men creepily leering and sexualizing you? Who else had to unlearn normalizing and being flattered by men creepily leering and sexualizing you?

I thought the way men showed they liked me was when they leered and sexualized me. I was groomed due to child sexual abuse and our sexist society... I thought this behavior was normal. I was flattered, turned on (traumatic bonding and brain changes), and was attracted to creeps. It didn‚Äôt feel like love or like a guy liked me enough if they didn‚Äôt sexualize me.

Now as I have been processing my past trauma, I realize how much I hate and fear being sexualized. I don‚Äôt want to be sexualized at all and get grossed out when men do. I don‚Äôt want to do anything sexual or even date for that matter. I now see how wrong it is for men to minimize me to a sexual body!

I was so offended recently when I went to an educational discussion and at the end of the meeting the men were leering at my body.. how horrible that sex was the only thing that was on their mind instead of my intellect and what I could bring to help them!!!

So this is progress for me to realize how wrong sexism is because in the past, I never saw myself as a feminist. I still struggle with my body being turned on by creepiness because it was what was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for so long. I am actually afraid of my sexuality right now and feel shame and disgust about it especially when I become turned on by violating sex. 

However, I‚Äôm also noticing When I watch movies or see pictures of women getting sexualized, I get grossed out and triggered More than I ever have. I am now allowing myself to get grossed out by the creepers and being mean to them when I wasn‚Äôt able to for most of my life. I still have a part of me that gets turned on by creepiness and sexualization but I can confidently say it is starting to fade away especially as I continue processing my trauma and become more of a feminist. I was brainwashed by society and the abusers in my life. It is so bizarre to now see the truth and how what I was told was a lie about the sexualization and abuse of women to be normal and flattering.

 I know with time and therapy, I will be able to retrain my brain to be turned on by healthy sex with consent and boundaries completely. I am already noticing that I am being drawn to these types of healthy relationships which I am very proud of myself for.

"Everyone assumes military I told a coworker a few weeks ago that I had a doctor's appointment and he asked why. I couldn't think of a lie in time so I just told him ""Because I have PTSD"" (which was the truth). His response was, ""You were in the service?"" I said, ""No, my dad was a piece of shit"" to which he just said ""Oh, yeah, me too"" and we stopped talking about it pretty shortly after that. 

I'm not really angry about it or anything - just bored enough to complain about it - but I hate how everyone assumes that if you have PTSD you must have served in the military. Just weird to me that nobody thinks of all the other possibilities.",ptsd
"DAE HATE when people say ‚Äúit will get better‚Äù or ‚ÄúI went through x and got through it with praying, you should too‚Äù? Or am I just sensitive and caving to the aggression of my PTSD symptoms?

No shit, I have to be strong. Otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt even be here right now. 

Someone said to me that they went through a comparable minor incident (breakup of a <2 year relationship), and got through it by praying to God, saying it liberated him and made him feel so content with life. And while yes, he is valid to feel upset about it, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate to bring that up to compare to my bus crash and my mental recovery with it. They and their family also went on to tell me that my medication was all gateway bullshit that I need to get off of and being the passive dipshit I am, I agreed with them and went along with all of it. 

Not to mention, when I told them I have PTSD, they went on to ask about my symptoms and even asked ‚Äúoh, what are your visions?‚Äù ‚Äúwhat are your nightmares?‚Äù ‚Äúwhat do you see at night?‚Äù and a TON of follow-up questions that forced me to go into detail that I didn‚Äôt want to. Again, I‚Äôm passive as hell so it‚Äôs not easy to say no to anyone, but I just wish people were more considerate and understanding. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm asking them to never talk about vehicle accidents, or to never make any quick movements, so why is it so hard to be decent and accommodate my basic needs? I‚Äôm sure people who don‚Äôt have PTSD at least know not to fucking ask about their flashbacks in detail.",ptsd
"PTSD IS REAL. Most everyone here already knows this. This is to the people who dis-believe in it and I hope to reach the ignorant or misinformed.

The insomnia is real. No one chooses to stay up all night and go to bed at 4AM, be tired as hell in the morning ,and feel like ran over garbage.

The triggers are real. Certain movies, noises and visuals can cause anger, fear, anxiety, depression, and sadness to the point of crying (even for non-cryers). This is due to the feeling of re-living the event(s).

The trust issues and suspicions about people are real and don't take it personally. Ever hear ""I like to keep most things to my self""? That's an auto-response, nothing personal.

The nightmares are real. Sometimes nightmares of re-living the event and then waking up feeling a chaos of bad emotions; often ruining your entire day/days.

Anxiety is real and is often because of [insert event(s)]. Creating it for people who didn't have it prior.

Avoiding talking about it and avoiding things that remind you of it doesn't make the problem invalid, and aren't just ""faking it"". It's a logical, natural coping mechanism to avoid thinking about it.

An aversion to being physically touched is real. Ever hear ""don't touch me"", or the person is uncomfortable with being touched? Well the [insert event] is *likely* related to that. Again, don't take it personally.


Point being: no one fakes anything I listed above for the sake of feeling pity or ""just playing the victim"". It's a real problem just like anything else and it doesn't *only* apply to veterans and law enforcement.

Hope I could shed some insight.",ptsd
"I just took my first shower in like ... months I get how gross that is ....


I use to be on point with my personal hygiene - haircuts every 2 weeks like clockwork, daily showers (sometimes more than one if I worked out), you know the basic self care things .....

Well I've spiraled into a really deep depression and have just given up on everything ..... the only thing I've made sure is that I wear deodorant and clean clothes (which is a miracle in itself ....) but then I got the flu .... and I've been sick for a few days without being able to do any laundry or even really get up and you know how you get that sweaty gross feeling? Well I finally dragged myself into the shower .... it's strange how fucking accomplished I feel at doing something most people don't think twice about

My heart rate was up but I was like whatever, she got away and nothing happened so I kept watching. And what the actual fuck I don't want to describe because it really disturbed me and I don't recommend anyone look this up please. But another group of men basically gang up and violate a woman.

"Holy shit therapy works. Crying with happiness. It's only in the last few years I've had the diagnosis (29f). Previously I've had counselling after a bad patch in university, then went on some anxiety/depression courses after that but it never quite fit. It was only when the mental health service asked if I'd ever considered PTSD then asked me a bunch of screening questions and it fit to a tea. 

I've had some EMDR therapy which was hard and horrible but helped. I did a lot of self soothing for my inner child. Had a lot of dissociative episodes after heavy sessions. Had terrible nightmares for years. Felt rubbish and fatigued for years. My therapist left the service but I was feeling 80% better. 

I had stressful time at the start of the year (work stress causes more intrusive thoughts and anxiety) and contacted the service again about finishing up cos I felt I still had those symptoms and they would surface with a vengeance. 

Just had a few more intense weekly sessions and the last couple have been awful. But the flashbacks were less clear. Then since my last session I've not had any sleep troubles or nightmares or anything. We rescored my questions and I've gone from around 40 to 8.  I've been discharged from the service and I've just cried with happiness. I feel free and whole.

"I (17) once saw my childhood abuser (19) at a diner. We were both kids. I realized I didn‚Äôt have to be angry anymore. We‚Äôve both grown up. After years of being so angry and afraid of some threat bigger than me, I realized after seeing her that she didn‚Äôt scare me anymore. That this big bad wolf in my head was just another kid like me. 

I cried on the way home. Not from fear, but from relief. She apologized and told me that she didn‚Äôt expect forgiveness. That‚Äôs something no one who‚Äôs hurt me ever said. She‚Äôs gotten so much better. I realized that she was also just an abused kid. 

I found closure in that aspect of my trauma. My other abusers, I will never see again or get an apology from, but this one I did. I‚Äôve been a lot better since. My mood swings aren‚Äôt as violent and I‚Äôm better at calming down.

"Anyone else have trauma resulting from inpatient mental hospital stays? Mental hospitals are fucking abhorrent environments, even in the 21st century. They cause far more harm than good toward most of their patients. I had the misfortune of being sent to two of them in 2018, and the second time was far worse (not that the first one was a picnic, mind you).

In August of that year I suffered a crippling nervous breakdown that was triggered by a myriad of factors, a breakdown that a now-ex-friend called a ""manic episode"". This resulted in me being cruelly misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder ""wItH pSyChOtIc FeAtUrEs"", which is a fucking crock of shit if ever I've heard one. I don't run around the streets naked screaming ""I'm God"", I don't smear my own shit on the walls, and I've never fucking hallucinated in my life. Yet still I am officially branded a psychopath. The only delusion I was under during this period was that I thought I actually *was* going insane. I went along with my torture because I was too weakened to advocate for myself.

If you want a detailed account of just what made my sentence in a nuthouse so abhorrent, look for a post I made entitled ""My trial by fire at Backwoods"" on the subreddit r/psychwardchronicles. I don't care to revisit all the gory details, you can see them for yourself on that post.

I will say right off the bat that these fucking cancerous institutions are committing a human rights violation by confiscating their patients' phones and music players. I know that sounds hyperbolic and whiny, but blasting music has always been a way to silence (or at least muffle) all the screams in my head. I mainly gravitate toward extreme metal because it screams for me when I can't scream myself. To deprive me of that in my most vulnerable and fragile moments is like breaking someone's legs and then kicking their crutches out from under them.

Oh, and not to mention witnessing daily brawls between patients, being surrounded by whackjobs who were way further off the deep end than myself, being forced to take zombifying doses of so-called ""anti-psychotic"" meds as a condition of your release, and patients getting forcibly injected in the asshole with Halidol. Those things weren't exactly pleasant. 

I still get frequent PTSD flashbacks to that Godforsaken shithole. I would like to go back there with my boyfriend though, just once, to take a piss on the grounds and smoke a joint and blow smoke in the useless amateur piece of shit p-doc's face. I think that would give me closure.

I don't believe in inpatient care. Only if a person is a credible threat to themself or another, and all other means of outpatient treatment have been exhausted, should sending a person to one of those places even be considered. 

I vow that I will never let myself be sent to another one of those ghettos of the soul for the rest of my life.

The first happened a few days ago when one of my professors was talking about getting her infant child vaccinated. She said it was traumatic for *her* even though *her baby was chillin* throughout the appointment.

The second was way back in high school when I had a friend say they had trauma around cats because *one time* a cat‚Ä¶. scratched her. Like. Bruh.

I get that trauma can come in all shapes and sizes but tbh it just really bothers me when I hear people talk like this or make jokes about it. I feel it makes those of us who have actual trauma and PTSD minimized and makes it seem like PTSD is just a silly little thing that‚Äôs easy to get over.

I have a lot of other stories (let me know if you‚Äôd like to hear more,) but here is one that really never left my head. When I was 8 (21 now,) I lived in an apartment with my mom, my brother, and me. My mom was addicted to amphetamines and was always living in this ghostly world. I remember her doing Oracle readings with me, I remember her having seances, and I remember me having strange things happen to me as a kid that I couldn‚Äôt make sense of. I kept coming to my mom with these problems and she believed I was possessed by a demon. I remember her taking me out to the the kitchen and there was a man with a cross on. He read the Bible over me and put holy water on my head and I just remember my mom screaming ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your name, what‚Äôs your name!?‚Äù And as an 8 year old I was confused I was scared and I was in shock. I told her I was me and she proceeded to say it was demon speaking for me. I remember looking up at the ceiling fan And I started following one with my eyes and from there it felt like I left the whole room. That was the first time I ever dissociated and it hasn‚Äôt stopped since that day. My mom went to prison and has been clean for many years now. I just recently asked her about this and she still truly believes that there were demons in that house and that was the end of it. Not the closure I needed. I didn‚Äôt even realize this affected me for so long until a couple months ago when I brought it up to her.  I‚Äôve never really told anyone about this story..

"I killed my grandmother, and then I did it thousands more times, and I don't know how to stop 50 years ago I went to the store with my grandmother, on the way there was a cemetery and I absolutely wanted us to stop by, so we walked up, my grandmother grabbed the handle and said that unfortunately the cemetery was closed. So we went on, did some shopping and were about to go home when I reminded my grandmother that we had forgotten something. We went back and as we passed the cemetery once again, a truck hit us on the curve. Grandma covered me with her body and took all the impact on herself. She died. I survived. I was taken from the scene of the accident to the hospital, where I lingered without visiting a family member. They came to pick me up after my grandmother's funeral, after a few days. When I realized that my grandmother was buried in that cemetery to which I wanted to see her off, I decided in the mind of the 3-year-old I was then, that I was the one who killed her.

For the past 50 years, I have been dressing up as a woman, strangling her and hanging her to re-enact the event. At the same time, I am afraid that someone will discover that I killed my grandmother. Any reenactment can end in death, because I am relieved only by the extreme state of experience on the borderline between life and death. 

It's difficult for me to talk about it with my family, who thinks there's nothing to talk about after 50 years. I can hear this for decades. They don't know what I'm going through when I fall into a complusive sequence of trauma-play that sometimes ends in psychotic states.

I feel like I've fucked up everything in my life, precisely because of this. Sometimes I can't believe I'm alive. And when I hear that I was lucky to have survived these accident 50-years back, I wish I had died then and not agonized like this, dying several times each week.",ptsd

"Success: able to enjoy sex again (TW: Sexual abuse) TW: mention of sexual abuse

If you told me only three months ago that I would be having sex again with no trouble whatsoever... I wouldn't have believed you. A break-up, a few therapy sessions and a new partner and it's like I'm living in a different world.

In my last relationship the inability to have sex started 1,5 years before our inevitable breakup. It started with no more PIV sex, then less and less and less sexual interaction until the last half a year nothing happened. I thought it was because of my other traumas, and was waiting (forever) for therapy to start. Now I've realised that he, too, did not respect my boundaries. I became scared whenever he displayed arousal, afraid he would coerce me into having sex, which would end up being uncomfortable(painful) for me, making the next time worse. I even got triggered by his heavy breathing. (Note: my therapist has since told me that sex should never be painful. If it is, just stop. If you continue your body is expecting the pain next time and tenses up, which just makes it painful again, and there you are in your own vicious cycle)

Now I'm working on my view on sexuality, especially my own sexuality & sexual pleasure. In the meantime I've met this amazing man who always asks for consent and backs off whenever I do not give an enthousiastic yes. My therapist is delighted I get to experience this right now, and for me it's like breathing a sight of relief. I don't even have to say no, though my goal is to be able to say no eventually. For now an ""I don't know"" is enough for him to not go further. A simple stop or even just laying my hand on his makes him stop as well. I never imagined it could be that easy. No whining, no passive aggressiveness, no disappointment, just happy to be doing whatever we're doing and just staying there.

The first time we met he asked me if he could give me a hug at the end. He saw my hesitation and immediatly said ""oh, that's a no, that's okay."" I felt the need to explain myself, of course, it was only because of covid, but it wouldn't have been necesarry with him. He was fine either way. It's been that way every step of the way, and I am so glad I get to experience this cause even if we don't end up working on the long term, I now know that there are good men out there who will respect your boundaries, and I will not put up with anything less ever again.

"People diagnosed with PTSD, are you ever inexplicably drawn to or aroused by the type of abuse you went through? Do any of you purposefully trigger yourselves? What is your reaction to the triggering usually like when you do that? (TW) (Im a survivor of sexual abuse in my childhood  but don‚Äôt have PTSD). It was an absolutely horrible thing which I have all kinds of complicated feelings towards. But even though my experiences were bad, I still am drawn to the abuse, almost aroused by it. Not in action of course, but only in my thoughts. After reading some threads here, I realised how common it is to almost fetishise your abuse as a way of coping, and how a lot of us feel ashamed for that too. Sometimes the abusers do things in a way that their victim‚Äôs body ‚Äúresponds.‚Äù 

In one thread here a woman was saying that when she was 5, her abuser was extremely patient and gentle and performed things in a way that her body responded and was aroused (and it‚Äôs of course still very traumatising nonetheless). But there was no ‚Äúviolence.‚Äù But isn‚Äôt that a criterion for PTSD? Is it possible to have PTSD from those kinds of experiences?


Also, as a survivor of sexual abuse, I know I seek out fictional material with sexual abuse or other kinds of dark subjects as it draws me strongly, and perhaps even arouses me. It ashames me that I‚Äôm this way but it‚Äôs a fact. Is this a way we purposefully trigger ourselves I wonder?

Are any of you who purposefully seek out things similar to your abuse, do you get triggered by it? What kinds of things do you seek out? If you aren‚Äôt triggered by it, then what triggers you? 

Second part of the question, do any of you purposefully trigger yourselves? How do you react to the triggering? 

I was reading some old threads on here about how people purposefully trigger themselves and that‚Äôs what had got me thinking. If you search ‚Äútrigger on purpose‚Äù you‚Äôll get some topics. Here are some examples of that: [#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/fbkpjm/ptsd_triggers_on_purpose/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), [#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/f3ocvn/i_trigger_myself_on_purpose/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), [#3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/g0lhbw/selftriggering/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). 

And also [this article](https://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/2015/07/03/ptsd-cant-stop-purposely-triggering-myself/) is a more through and interesting example of that. 

A recap of the questions:

1. Are you sometimes drawn to or aroused by the abuse you went through? 

2. Do you seek those things out in a simulated way? Either by reading, watching, fantasising, role play, etc.? 

3. Do you get triggered when you do these things? If not, what tends to trigger you? If yes, what is your response like? 

4. Do you ever purposefully trigger yourself?(similar to what this woman explained [here](https://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/2015/07/03/ptsd-cant-stop-purposely-triggering-myself/)). How do you react to this triggering? Is it milder than usual? Stronger?

I ask these questions because I was reading an article here about how those suffering from PTSD will go to ANY LENGTH whatsoever to AVOID that experience and anything that triggers them at all costs, whereas those suffering from some form of anxiety and who have past trauma will feel a very strong emotional response and discomfort instead, and that *that* is a distinction between both of these disorders.

That sounded a little different from what I‚Äôve read from people‚Äôs experiences on here. Is this that these people were not diagnosed with PTSD? That those suffering from PTSD will always try to avoid those experiences at any cost?

I have a coworker who for the past few weeks has realized I‚Äôm very jumpy and easily startled, so he‚Äôs been scaring me multiple times a day. Jumping out from behind hiding spots and making a big noise, suddenly yelling or clapping behind me when I‚Äôm focusing on something.

I‚Äôve put a lot of work into recovery with therapy, a lot for me has improved, but my body still goes from 0-100 when someone scared me like that.

EDIT- update

Hi guys, I did it and it thankfully went pretty smooth. I kept it simple and didn‚Äôt straight up say I have PTSD- basically just told him it is causing me stress and that I need him to stop. He was very apologetic (it felt genuine) and said he would stop, acted kind of awkward and avoidant for the rest of the shift but I expected that. I think he will definitely listen and stop, and if he doesn‚Äôt, I can take it to my boss and HR. But I have a good feeling from how things went and felt that it will be ok and won‚Äôt come to that.

I really appreciate all the support and advice today on this post, it helped give me the strength to stand up for myself and actually say something. That‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been very difficult in my life so being able to do that was a big victory for me- I know so many of you here understand that. It makes me sad that so many of you have dealt with situations like this in the workplace too. It  sucks so much to deal with, and I send love to anyone currently having to deal with a coworker like that.

"Memory loss after arguments? One HUGELY annoying thing about my PTSD is that I seem to blank out during arguments so that afterwards I can't remember what the person said or did. So therefore I have absolutely no leg to stand on, and can rarely win any argument because I simply can't remember. It's so frustrating when I know I'm right but can't prove it. Especially when the person I'm arguing with has been a complete ass.

I've never seen anybody else mention this before. Is this common with PTSD?",ptsd
"I talk about my trauma like I'm reading a book out loud My therapist once told me that when I talk about my trauma, it sounds like when you're in class and you're reading a book out loud. There is no emotion in your voice, it's completely monotone and sounds like you are talking about someone else. Does anyone else have this too? Emotionless when talking or thinking about trauma? To me, it almost seems like I'm outside my body watching it happen and I can't feel anything at all. Or maybe I'm just crazy.",ptsd
"Did anybody else here think that their PTSD was just severe depression? Before I knew what was *going on* I assumed it was severe, severe depression and just assumed that I had extreme depression. When I told my psychiatrist what was going on his jaw opened and he said ‚ÄúHoly shit you have PTSD‚Äù (he has known me since I was very young). I responded ‚ÄúOh, I thought it was just depression‚Äù and he gave me a very serious look like ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not‚Äù. When I started going to treatment I began to realize why he had that response. It really is something else, a different beast. When I started to explain the, you know, *mirror thing* to him is when he literally dropped his pen, looked up at the ceiling and just had this look on his face of ‚Äúoh my fucking god not her‚Äù‚Ä¶..like he knew how hard this was going to be. I didn‚Äôt know at the time.  I have never seen a human being look that concerned in my life, to this day. Because he studied the brain he knew it to a T, whereas most people don‚Äôt. Still one of the most insane interactions I have ever had in my life, and I‚Äôve had a lot. Still sends me a chill just thinking about it. The look of doom from a psychiatrist that knows you, and has known you since a teenager, is something that will never be erased from my memory, because he saw me grow up. This man is extremely professional. When it set in he looked in the distance for a while. He was stunned.  Has anybody else ever had this interaction or something similar?",ptsd
"The trauma of gay death destroyed my life I‚Äôve been in intensive therapy for about a year and a half now, and a month ago I finally made a breakthrough. 

Through EMDR ( I didn‚Äôt believe it at first, but it does work!), I came to the realization that the trauma I faced when I turned 14 years old and realized I‚Äôm gay completely obliterated my life. 

I‚Äôm getting teary eyed writing this. 

When I realized I was gay my whole entire world fell apart. My parents were going to disown me, I could never get married( marriage equality was legalized 8 years after I realized I‚Äôm gay), can‚Äôt have kids, excommunication from orthodox Jewish community, and so many unfortunate traumatic losses that came from realizing I‚Äôm gay in 2007. 

I remember my mom would say she hated gays and that fueled my desire to obliterate my gayness. Being gay at the time truly was synonymous with death if I came out at 14 I truly would‚Äôve lost everything. I instantaneously without even realizing went into a trauma response where I destroyed my internal gayness and tragically became my own worst enemy because my gayness was inside of me and it was the biggest threat to my survival. 

After having this breakthrough I‚Äôve never been happier. I realized in therapy that homophobia 15 years ago isn‚Äôt relevant anymore and the threat has dissipated. Trauma makes you believe and feel as if you‚Äôre still at the time and place the trauma happened. Being gay at the time was the ultimate trauma because I literally could‚Äôve lost everything and other gay teens I knew did loose everything when they came out. 

I intrinsically destroyed my heart, mind, and soul because my gayness was dwelling on my feelings, thoughts, and existence. 
But I‚Äôve accepted my gayness and My mind and heart have returned to me and my soul is on his way. I‚Äôve been living as if that trauma was still true, but it hasn‚Äôt been in a long time. 

Homosexuality was never the problem, homophobia always was. 

I‚Äôm 29 and feel so behind. I‚Äôm starting my brand new life now, a life without my trauma. 

I‚Äôve never been happier and more ecstatic, but the road ahead is daunting.",ptsd
"had my manager make fun of my ptsd when he found out about it I had to go home early one day of work this week, due to my ptsd.

"Witnessed my girlfriend having a PTSD episode for the first time Using a throwaway account for privacy reasons.

So I've been dating this girl for about two months, and I love everything about her. As cliche' as this sounds, she's been the greatest thing to ever happen in my life and I wouldn't trade her for anything. We're college aged lovebirds enjoying every moment together.

I've been staying at her place for about a week and tonight was the first time I've witnessed her PTSD episode come to fruition. Now, I already know about her condition and that she's had flashbacks and episodes before. This all stemmed from growing up with a mother who had multiple personality disorder to where during her mother's bad days she was abused heavily to the point of trauma. As of recent, my GF's episodes have been far less frequent and a lot better, and I personally have never seen it happen. 

Until tonight.

Earlier in the day, she mentioned about having hallucinations and seeing the wall turn from white to purple wavy colors. She mentioned it was really nothing and not bad at all. I put it in the back of my mind and paid no further heed, as the rest of the day was very much a happy one, albeit I did notice her seemingly tired a bit more. 

Tonight, we were laying in bed and after some merrymaking we were chilling and resting in silence. However, soon I started noticing tears form. She claimed it was nothing, but I knew better. I hugged her and held her close, then she started balling in my shoulder. As I have no experience, I did what I best thought I could do: I kept telling her everything is alright, I'm here, and I'll protect and be with her always no matter what, hugging her as tight as I could.

She continued for about thirty minutes in my arms, then seemed to have calmed down. She was less audible but she said she felt better. I turned on all the lights and currently have some of her favorite songs playing and get her comfortable enough to get some good sleep. 

I haven't had a deep conversation concerning the specifics of how her episodes manifest, what they're like, and how best to deal with them due to not wanting to instigate a possible episode. I've entered in this relationship knowing full well about her condition and I still love her anyways and want to be there even more and help her the best way possible. She's been seeing a therapist near our college since last year, until COVID-19 happened and we moved back to our respective homes from college. She said she dissociated a lot in the past and she's had a mental breakdown episode that lasted for two weeks last year that prompted her to start therapy. 

Anyhow, as someone who can say they don't have much experience with PTSD, how can I best help her as her boyfriend? As of now, I cannot physically be with her 24/7, so I'd love to know tips for long distance help as well. Just anything in general to help her through this condition and help her be as happy and feel as safe as possible.",ptsd

"Living with PTSD is incredibly exhausting I wonder if people without PTSD have any idea of just how exhausting it can be to live with it.

It tires me out on a daily basis. My triggers are everywhere, especially when I leave my place and venture out in public. Being constantly set off by these things is exhausting. My heart races, my muscles tense, I start to growl... I'm basically thrown into fight-or-flight mode all the time. And don't get me started on the constant anxiety that forces me to be on hyper alert for my triggers.

Even short trips to the convenience store a couple of blocks away can run me ragged by the time I get back. It drains me so fast. I keep thinking that I should just lock myself away in my room, hidden from the outside world, but that isn't realistic, especially since I started working again in December.

I have to face it, so I do. It doesn't make it any easier. In fact, its twisting me in a way. I have very angry and violent thoughts about hurting others as a result, to add to the exhaustion. Dealing with those intrusive thoughts is exhausting in itself. Then there's the Worm, but that's a topic for a different subreddit.

Why am I so tired all the time? Well, PTSD is one of the reasons why.",ptsd

"Found The Dead Body of my Fianc√©s Brother He committed suicide in our house. When I found him, he was in rigor mortis, his eyes were open and lifeless. I called 9-1-1.

They asked me to lower him onto the floor. He was too heavy because he is bigger than me. I told them again that he is dead. I have PTSD now.

"I stood up to a bully today/  I was working, just doing my job. A vendor with whom I was working became very aggressive during negotiations. I recognized he was trying to take advantage of me, so I held my ground. He then charged at me, invaded my personal space and threatened to knock me out. He also wasn't wearing a mask and was spitting everywhere, mind you.
But I wasn't even scared, or anxious. I was actually angry. My fight or flight clicked into fight for the first time in my life. He was a big guy and stood in my face and told me he was going to hit me, and I told him to just hit me. It's strange but as big as he was, he looked small to me. Like he couldn't even hurt me if he wanted to.
Anyway, he stood down and I left, then told my boss about what happened and that I won't be going back. The panic began after the incident and is still happening right now.

"Finally went to trauma therapy, drove home, and fired my therapist. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and have been on every anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication for 4 years (since being committed after a suicide attempt). I wasted all those years, still being miserable. I finally fired him and tapered off all my meds. I felt free, like I broke up with a controlling boyfriend. I knew I needed to work on the core of why I'm so miserable (lots of trauma) so I scheduled an appointment with a well regarded trauma therapist. 

She spent the whole appointment covering herself. She said I was ""passively suicidal"" (I said I have no intention of hurting myself again but see no meaning in life). She said I needed to be ""stabilized."" She sort of threatened she might need to commit me (which was a very traumatic experience for me). And said she'd need to discuss my history with my old Psychiatrist and she probably wouldn't be able to work with me unless I was at least on anti-depressants again. She forced me to sign the release form to get on the books for another appointment.

I left feeling really pissed off. Drove home, wrote her an e-mail explaining what a disappointment it was, revoked her rights to discuss anything with my old Psychiatrist, and cancelled my next appointment.

I'm just venting. All I wanted was someone who could to talk with me and help me that way. Most of my trauma is centered around horrible medical care, so it's a big deal for me to reach out for help, only to be screwed over again.",ptsd

"2022 Broke me, mentally, physically and emotionally TW: Counting down the clock to the New Year‚Äôs ring, as I am literally done with this year. This year ate me up and spat me back out and dragged me around the block. Anything that could have gone wrong went wrong. This year alone has unfortunately shafted me in every way possible

It began with my husband and I got rear-ended in the middle of January. At the end of January, My husband got Covid and was very sick with it. We got our eviction notice in the middle of February. Due to our landlord not paying his mortgage.  After My husband cleared Covid at the end of February he ended up in hospital in a very bad state with severe pneumonia to which the doctors said if he continued to get any worse he would be put into a coma and put on a ventilator. I was terrified of losing my husband as he declined so much to where he was on 50% oxygen within five days of being admitted to the hospital. 

When My husband got out of the hospital we had to find somewhere to live as we only had four months to leave. We weren‚Äôt having any luck for ages because landlords weren‚Äôt getting back to us. We really felt like we were going to be homeless due to no fault of our own. In May, last minute we got a place.

Five days after we signed our lease we were put into a position we had to foster a cousin of mine to prevent her from going into a random foster home. So I had to try to move house while minding a toddler. Fostering my cousin, blew up the remaining family I had in my life due to lies and other BS.  so the only family member I had left in my life was my husband and my father. 

I befriended a girl online in July. She attempted suicide within a few weeks of me knowing her and I found her unconscious with blood everywhere. She berated me for saving her and called me selfish and then she moved to England a week later. My husband was in a crash while on the way to work In August and that itself has been a nightmare dealing with car insurance and getting a new car as our car got written off. 

At the end of September, I went on a night out with a friend, while trying to keep an eye on my drunk friend, I was the one held down and brutally raped‚Ä¶I had bruises on my face, the back of my neck, and an injured shoulder. That itself has been mental torture‚Ä¶ PTSD taking over every aspect of my life. Sleepless nights, extreme anxiety to the point I can barely leave the house most days. I can barely get myself to eat much since it. The panic attacks, the flashbacks, and the overwhelming anxiety I can‚Äôt manage my feelings anymore‚Ä¶ I know this affecting my husband too which is hurt to see as I know he‚Äôs trying to hold it all together for me. This year has shown a lot of people‚Äôs true colours and shown us a new depth of mental health. 

I‚Äôm writing this to raise awareness, to highlight you don‚Äôt know exactly what is going on in others' lives as everyone is fighting a battle or battles of their own. So be kind, as that can go a long way with someone who‚Äôs fighting a battle you know nothing about. I hope 2023 is better!",ptsd

"""The Body Keeps the Score"" My new favorite book 2.5 years ago, I had a near death experience that landed me in a medically induced coma for 9 days. I thought 10 years had gone by when I woke up and I lost 30 pounds of muscle. That experiences also unlocked a lot of repressed memories for me. I was sleeping at most 4 hours a night, barely eating and I couldn't stand the company of others. I was a horrible wreck and barely able to function.

1.5 years after that experience, I was able to start therapy. I also went back to physical therapy and both of these therapists kept recommending a book to me about the impact PTSD has on us. It was written by a psychologist who has been treating trauma since the early 1970s, starting with Vietnam War veterans, moving on to specializing in treating people who have been physically or sexually abused as children.

It took me a long time to finally get this book. I was convinced the connection I had with my body was permanently altered because of this overwhelming experience. I could barely feel my left side, my throat was totally numb from the tube they had down my throat even 2 years later. The sheets of my bed made my skin crawl, reminding me of struggling weakly to move around in the hospital bed. I was too traumatized to believe relief was possible.

Then I started reading this book. Maybe this wont be everyone, but reading this book makes me think that what is happening to me is actually understandable, its manageable, its treatable and its **not permanent**. I can feel more now, things are getting better, its easier for me to de-escalate the tension and stress I feel on a daily basis.

I was sexualized starting as a child from my father through mostly covert sexual abuse. The way I survived was by seducing and flirting with him. My mom was out to get me and the way I learner to receive love was by seducing. It became a way for me to get control in an unsafe situation. If I got the man to develop a crush on me, distract them and become infatuated, I was more able to control them so I was safe. I notice this pattern will come out especially around unsafe and angry men. I‚Äôve done this technique when I felt I was being discriminated against, too. It gets the men to let their guard down, be nicer to me and get what I want because to them I am flattering their ego and playing submissive. Obviously this is maladaptive coping mechanism that I am unlearning. But yeah I realized recently it has helped me survive racism and sexism And to avoid others‚Äô aggression. I also realized I liked how it kept me safe and gave me power in an unsafe situation.

It never looked like breaking down crying for no apparent reason, it never looked like waking up panting with your heart pounding at 3 am unsure if you're really there or back somewhere, it never looked like feeling powerless and constantly wondering why you got to live.

I was kicked out of a bar and the bouncer called me a bitch/cunt and I went off. Next thing I know I woke up in the hospital with two black eyes. They weren‚Äôt from the bouncer, I had drunkenly stumbled and fell flat on my face. I was so shocked to see how awful I looked, but was at the same time relieved because I was finally able to see pain. Please note that I do NOT recommend accidental or voluntary self harm as according to one of my other therapists, that is common for emotional abuse survivors. Instead we need to break our silence and educate and have people start looking deeper than the skin level and understand that the scars that lie beneath can truly be the deepest.

She was very supportive and loving, and made me promise to give her a big hug when I saw her next, which I obviously did. It‚Äôs still a big struggle, but having her unconditional love and support means the world to me. She said she would move heaven and earth to help me. It was really hard to tell her, so I had to by writing a letter, putting it on her bed and going to a friends house.",ptsd

As I sat there, reading these stories, a thought occurred to me. I have my own mythology... PTSD is a part of my mythology. It wouldn't be my story without it. Something about that idea was so comforting to me. It helped me to see myself in a whole new way.

"Why are ex-gang members and people who have been involved in that lifestyle for the most part shunned by society when they wish to seek help for trauma? Its difficult for me to even say this, but I feel it to be very true. I lived in that world for many years. Lost ""brothers"" to violence, constant worry and fear that you will be next, things of that nature. Much of which begins at a fairly early age. 15 years old for myself. It often times feels as though society as a whole does not give a damn about those of us who survive to be productive adults. Which leads many to go undiagnosed, and afraid to seek help. At 35 years old, I have been fortunate enough to reach out to deal with the many traumatic events that have plaqued my mind for years. Just yesterday learning a name for what I have been experiencing since I left all that behind at 29 years of age. While it feels good to know a name for this...""hypervigilance"".

"I want to be a psychologist, but I'm sick of what people say behind closed doors. Hi Sorry for the long post, ive not really made a post before and my thoughts are all over the place at the moment.

Not many people I know professionally know that I have PTSD. It's something I've been made to be ashamed about after working on a psychiatric ward and now while I study my Msc.

I was on a 1:1 with a patient who was in the midst of a breakdown and was performing similar (and very distressing) behaviours as my abuser. When I asked my co-workers for help they told me they would come and assist. I was left waiting for 4 hours, (even though I was only supposed to be on 1:1 for an hour, as trust policy dictates). I told them that was not ok and to not do that again. They did it again the next shift I was with them.

At the next staff meeting I told the team about this incidence and how it should not be happening, if a staff member needs to tap out, they should be able to tap out. The manager said I was right to tell everyone and she would have words with the staff on shift that day. I was really happy to have had that conversation and to have it out in the air.

Fast forward to handover straight after the meeting, where there were 10 nurses in the nurses office, I was sitting down while everyone was standing around me. The manager walks in and says are we looking after \*my name\* or are we looking after the patients? Everyone, apart form one nurse who saw me burst out laughing. Another nurse said I shouldn't be in the job. I coughed loudly and everyone went quiet. I walked out and kept myself busy looking after my patients.

Another time my colleagues said they could never be friends with/date someone who has mental health issues.

Whilst studying my masters a student in my cohort noted how PTSD is a disease and that those with PTSD have deformed brains. Well yeah I have a deformed brain but its not my fault, I went through shit, and that effected my neurology as it would anyone.

&#x200B;

* Am I just being really sensitive?
* Is there anyone else out there who works in mental health that has experienced the same?
* Those who look after others are humans themselves, surely we're allowed to have mental health issues aswell?

&#x200B;

I think going through my own mental health issues actually made me a better nurse because I know the *depths* patients are talking about.

I'm just frustrated, I'm largely ok now, I have the occasional wobble here and there but I pick myself up and carry on fighting. I don't even know if I should carry on trying to be a psychologist. But I don't want the career I've always wanted to be another thing he has robbed from me

&#x200B;

p.s. **Please please please** reach out for help if you need it, don't be put off by a few vile creatures I've worked with. Not all mental healthcare professionals are like this, I have had the pleasure of meeting some individuals in the industry who have restored my faith in humanity (which is no small task).",ptsd

"My family and I survived the Afghan war. I still have trauma My family and I immigrated to the US from Kabul after the invasion. I still remember vividly the time when the US invaded. The sound of American aircraft flying above everyday was terrifying, you would not know if it was surveillance or bombs. My dad and I have witnessed many deaths first hand caused by American soldiers. Somehow me and my family survived. My cousins and uncles didn't. I think about this everyday. Even all this trauma withstanding, my family and I fled Afghanistan to come to the US for a better life.

A decade later, I still have very severe trauma. I have flashbacks that paralyze me in the middle of a task. And I have triggers - so many of them, some of them obvious, some of them just bizarre. One such trigger was last week, when a AC130, or a plane similar to it, flew above my house in San Jose. [I posted in another subreddit about it but the responses were callous and unsympathetic](https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/n1ay9g/had_panic_attacks_yesterday_from_ac130_gunship/).

"Dear Brain, you repressed that shit for a reason. Don‚Äôt go randomly remembering it, especially without warning. I saw a post on one of the advice subs (idr which one). Basically this guy was having sex with his girlfriend and she asked him if he wanted to watch her have sex with his friends. 

My brain went... ‚ÄúHey. That sounds familiar. Give me a second while I dig into that.‚Äù

Then I suddenly remembered... My extremely abusive, hyper-sexual ex... I think it was the same week, maybe even the same session (it‚Äôs all a blur) where he took the condom off and proceeded to fuck me despite me screaming no and pushing on him and crying...

Before all that he had asked me something about him watching me have sex with guy friends. He brought up a specific friend, Daniel. I told him I was uncomfortable with it and I didn‚Äôt want to do it or think about it. 

Later, he proceeded to describe it in detail while we were having sex once. Just thrusting that image of my platonic friend fucking me while he watched. 

I wasn‚Äôt able to look Daniel in the eyes for weeks. I got paranoid of every moment around him. 

Eventually we got back to normal. We‚Äôre not even that close anymore. But I hate what my ex did to me. And that friendship.

So idk how I'm the whore in this scenario, but whatever) then a few months later, he sent me 69¬¢ through PayPal. No message attached or anything. Just 69¬¢. And that's when I realized this wasn't going to stop. So I systematically went through to every platform I had a profile on, and if there was a way of contacting another person on there, I tried to see if he had an account and blocked it. 

A year goes by. It's blissfully silent from his idiocy, except in my trauma dreams, but those I laugh away because they're dumb AF. Then this mother fucker is doing this shit again with new profiles, but instead of calling me a whore, now he's calling me a liar (which is but isn't true. That's a whole other thing. We don't have the time for that.) He even has his current girlfriend in on it, too. 

And I just want to go off on him. And ask, wtf do you want? You're acting like a fucking child. Grow the fuck up. How sad is your relationship that you roped her into harassing your ex? What kind of lies did you have to tell her about me for that? You think I believe the world is fucking me over when it's my own fault? Well at least I can take responsibility when I fuck up and not blame everyone else around me and put myself on a pedestal so fucking high, there's no longer any oxygen getting to my fucking brain. 


But can I? Realistically, sure. I could. But he's volatile. Doing so would only cause more problems. So as the victim of his bullshit, I have to just *take it* and do essentially nothing. Not even restraining orders are good enough. The lengths to which you have to go to get a permanent RO for it to only be good for 5 years? Please. And my ex literally doesn't care about any law. At all. He's some backwoods inbred hillbilly. (don't ask why I dated him. I was being a fucking moron for so long. And stuck in a cycle.) 

I'm just so sick of having to be the bigger person while the abusers get to do whatever the fuck they want. Unless it's active violence or in person, the cops can't do shit, either. I know. I tried. Multiple times.


TL;DR : Fuck the high road, it's bullshit and I'm sick of it.",ptsd

Every since then I have a deathly fear of young women around the late teens early 20s age. To the point where I dont let my 19 year old sister touch me or be in the same room as me. But today. Today was different, I let my sister hold my hand and I didn't freak out run away or cry I had anxiety the entire time but it wasnt a out burst like normal. My therapist taught me to associate my sister with trust and how she would never try to hurt me and I did that I told myself in my head all she is doing is holding your hand that's it.

"Anyone else get PTSD from a parent with BPD? I took my comment from another thread to start this discussion:

My mom had BPD and abandoned me when I was 3, thankfully my dad was amazing and held onto me. Whenever i would see her (starting again at age 6) her symptoms would have her be extremely volatile. She wouldn't give me affection unless it was a show for someone else, called me her niece in public for a while, drank all the time, and made her adult problems mine. I had to escort her out of family parties at 10 when she would get drunk and belligerent. When I was 13 or so I remember she spit on me. When I was 16 she chased me into a bathroom and told be she was going to beat my ass because I started calling my step mom ""mom"" too. I never called her by her name to her face, she just didnt want to share. Following 16, she started with a lot of false suicide attempts for attention, which I always treated seriously. Our relationship was so weird. First she didnt want me, then we were familiar strangers, acquaintances, distant cousins, and then friends.

Until her last suicide attempt, that accidentally went through. The table broke under her. The police I called called me to come down.  It was the day before her dads 70th birthday, and I had to tell him to his face that his daughter was never coming back. 

I did her makeup for her viewing. It's the least I could do. I loved her so much, in the most damaging way to myself. I put up with everything because it was obvious her BPD made her suffer and everyone except her family left her. I couldnt stop grasping for the love she wasnt able to give. 

Now I struggle to get and keep jobs. That was only the worst thing that happened to me. I had a marriage with a man that was practically the Male version of her, and I was raped after I left him...I got catfished...please dont call me stupid I was vulnerable. It took 9 months to meet. 


Now the obvious triggers get to me, cluttered houses, crowds, loud places, and the month of July is awful for me. 

Sorry this was so long.

"I kindly pushed back on someone in a mental health group saying that the difference between a victim and a survivor is that a victim can‚Äôt get over what happened to them, while a survivor overcomes I was waiting for someone else in the group to say something because it was really insensitive and way over simplifying the impacts of trauma. I understand the desire to want to distill things down into sayings like this and I think it‚Äôs totally great if that works for you, but sharing a sort of purity test on whether you ‚Äúwallow or push on‚Äù as whether you‚Äôre a survivor or not isn‚Äôt great for the group imo. 

I decided to respond and I made sure to acknowledge that I can see the point they are trying to make, but that it‚Äôs not that simple. I took my time to explain that having ptsd, I have flashbacks and other symptoms that can be extremely difficult to manage and I do wallow. I probably will never ‚Äúget over‚Äù what happened to me. That doesn‚Äôt take away from my strength and resilience. We are all survivors, healing is not linear and it‚Äôs important that as survivors, that we can identify with our strength and resilience even if we wallow, cry, feel miserable and stuck. The journey is unique for everyone so let‚Äôs not over simplify, let‚Äôs not put so much pressure on ourselves or others. 

They responded with being snarky about the amount I wrote and then reiterated what they had said, saying that‚Äôs what it comes down to, ‚Äúnuances and excuses aside.‚Äù

"My Story Summarized I died six years ago, a victim of domestic violence. You don't hear our stories because we are called liars, babies, not man enough, stupid, etc. ""Who are they going to believe, a 6 foot tall man or a 5 foot tall girl"" I was often told when I said one day I would run away and she couldn't find me. She would punch herself in the face and say I did it. She would grab hammers and threaten to bruise herself and say she would tell the cops I did it and she would get a warrant out for my arrest if I tried to leave. I was trapped.

Men can be raped as well. My abuser raped be on several occasions. If I couldn't get it up after hours of abuse I was called every name in the book and told ""What kind of f****t can't get up to an attractive woman?"". If I refused she would tell me there would be ""consequences"" and never describe what they were. Sometimes she would say things like ""I will wait for you at your mom's and you will see the consequences"" which typically made me do whatever she wanted. If I ever finished too quickly she made me sleep on the wooden floor in the corner of the room as punishment for ""using her like a piece of meat"".

I have been free of her for 3 years but her words and actions still haunt me. A simple nod or a juice container can send me into a panic attack. Those around me look at me like I am some weird weak man. They don't know the stories of men like me because no one cares about our stories.

Johnny Depp may know from his situation he is dealing with. But even in the press he is slandered on the fact he is a man. I know people will not believe my story too. My abuser has spent years creating paper trails and stories for this very moment. She's made me say multiple times that I was the abuser just to calm her down. She's hit me behind closed doors and screamed at me that I was hitting her. She took complete control of my finances. I was not allowed to make a purchase without her approval. I worked full days while she sat and took money from my account into her private account as she watched television. She made me put mint oil on my crotch when I told her I was reading an email but was really playing a game on my phone as ""punishment"" for not watching her get ready. 

She made me get rid of my dog and didn't let me see my family other than maybe once or twice a year. She made me lie and tell them all I was homeless to get money even though I was well off to fund her trips to Louisiana, New York, Spain, etc. Every day my appearance was scrutinized until I acted and looked almost exactly how she wanted. She turned most of my friends against me with lies and half truths.

Everyday I struggle to just get to the next day. I don't sleep. I can't work more than a few hours a day. Constant flashbacks keep me trapped in my head. Depression and anxiety make things like answering the phone near impossible and medication has not helped because the memories don't disappear.

One thing I started to do is like, focus on something OTHER than the event but it‚Äôs still in that flashback time. 

So for example, my flashbacks are related to a sexual assault. Rather than focusing on the action itself, I try to remember what the stairs looked like. We were in a basement when it happened, so I try to picture the stairs and then maybe the walls. 

Another time, I tried to remember what was on the tv, or make up something to be on the tv.

This post is referring to the discomfort we can feel when asked this specific question. Please stop making comments on this particular experience, as that is not what this post is about.)

Second experience was during a heart to heart with a friend. He had just been telling me about his trauma because the situation we were in at the time was very triggering to him. He likely has PTSD, so I told him that I had PTSD as well as we related to each other. Another ‚Äúfrom what?‚Äù that caught me off guard yet again.

I don‚Äôt understand why therapist don‚Äôt diagnose CPTSD. They generally only diagnose PTSD. I personally think there is a dramatic difference between the two. When someone (like myself) has been through so many terrifying situations that you can‚Äôt narrow down the exact cause of your PTSD they really should confidently put such people down for CPTSD. I feel it helps the next doctor or therapist understand that they are a bit more complex and probably need a bit more assistance understanding their emotions around many life traumas and not just one huge traumatic event.,ptsd

"It's just hit me how young I was during my trauma Today is my nephew's 12th birthday. I was watching him play with his 10 year old brother and suddenly it hit me like a ton of bricks that I was even younger than them when I was groomed by a paedophile.

They seemed so young and innocent playing together, it shocks and sickens me how someone could even think about taking that away from a 9yr old. I loved High School Musical. My room was pink everywhere- the walls, carpet, my bed etc. I doted on my Siamese cat, Lola. I loved my two pet rats but was allergic to them. I used to excitedly wait for my dad to get home from work so I could play on the PS3 with him. I would go for walks with my nan on the weekends along the beach, and run off and twirl towards the sea to feel free. 

Then that October I met someone on MSN who I thought was 13... and it escalated from there. My innocence was ripped away from me. From then on, all I knew was fear. Anxiety. Crying. My mum couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. I kept it secret for all these years, terrified whenever the phone or doorbell rang that it was him coming to get me.

"My trauma story. I swear it's true, I can't make this up. There is HOPE! Cliff notes of my life:

My dad murdered my mom when I was 1 years old, which sent me to foster care then to an emotionally abusive grandmother. 18 years of horrible bullying by my peers because I had a cleft lip and palate.

I fixed all of that only to have a child who inherited an extreme expression of my genetic abnormality that caused my cleft. She had tetrology of fallot (a serious heart abnormality) and other issues. I won custody and worked very hard to get her to a point to attempt a repair of her heart. In 2007 She was 3 and I made the decision and took her for surgery. 4 surgeries and 10 days later I was forced to make another decision. I scheduled the time to end life support and had to watch. Was the final straw.

11 years of alcoholism later (July 5, 2018) I drowned while intoxicated in front of my healthy 3 year old and 10 year old. 10 minutes underwater, 3 days in coma and thought to be brain dead, I woke up.

Took me 1 more year to get completely sober. Sober since June 2019 and I have also conquered my PTSD. There is HOPE. Do not give up and please get help. It is work and initially very hard, but the alternatives can be horrible for you and your loved ones.",ptsd

I can't even watch the video George Floyd because it'll give me flashbacks. My abuser used to pin me down and sit on me when he thought I was too ""out of hand"" (I wasn't, I was usually just upset when he did this). He wouldn't get off until I calmed down, despite me telling him I would call down if he just got off of me.

I have autism and sensory processing, so it was only harmful to me. I can't even describe it. I won't go into detail, but it was horrible.

He ignored my pleas every time. He refused to listen when I said it only hurts me. I remember that I've even said ""I can't breathe"" and he didn't listen.

I can still recall his weight on me. How I felt like I couldn't breathe. How I begged for him to get off of me, but he wouldn't listen. How he would then play the victim because of the marks I left when I reacted to what was practically torture for me. How one time my mom was begging for him to get off of me, which he ignored.

Hearing the word ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù thrown around like it means ‚Äúmildly unpleasant or inconvenient‚Äù makes it so much harder for me to feel comfortable talking about my PTSD. I‚Äôd love to be able to refer to it like any other disability or physical health issue, but it‚Äôs becoming harder and harder to feel like I‚Äôd be taken seriously. I get that people use humour to deal with topics they feel uncomfortable with, but it‚Äôs already such an isolating experience on its own, and this just makes it worse. 

Thanks for listening, friends.

"Should I find new friends? Why do people not take rape seriously? Maybe I have the wrong people around me, but it seems like the people I know just don't care. I was at a festival a week ago and saw a guy who raped me a few years ago. I froze when i saw him, hell at first i dissociated so hard that I barely recognized him, but managed to get out of the situation without breaking down. Later on, back at ny friend's camp, I told my ""best friend"", in quotations because I seriously don't know if she is even my friend anymore, and she just said ""Okay"" and started talking about something else. I told my brother and he didn't say much either. So I left it be.

At the bar I used to spend my saturday evenings everyone believes my rapist because ""he wouldn't do such a thing"". I'm not welcome there anymore.

And before you flame me, I know I should have gone to the cops back then right away after it happened. I KNOW! I kick myself every day for it. I got raped and abused a lot when I was a kid and getting raped again triggered my PTSD so severely that I was completely out of it for weeks after it happened. I was too fucked up to go to the cops. I had no one who would have helped me, even my bf at the time. The dude was his best friend at the time, so I guess I know why... 

I'm sorry, by now I am just ranting. I know I should have reported him when I still had enough evidence and that's probably why not everyone believes me but goddamnit, I'm just so done with everything... People often come to me for help and advice when they feel down, I cheered up my ""best friend"" for weeks after her ex broke up, but when I have something on my mind, it just seems like it's not worth their time.

So to the point; I need new friends, don't I?



Edit: Oh wow, I never thought this would get so much attention, I thought I may get a comment or two if I get lucky.

"Please rethink the advice you give here! I understand the importance of validating the pain that other people have faced in this community. I really do. But that can be done without spreading misinformation.

Not everyone who has experienced a traumatic event will develop PTSD! 

You do not need to experience symptoms directly after the event. In other words, delayed onset is possible. 

If you have experienced a traumatic event, give yourself time to heal. It‚Äôs normal to ruminate about past experiences. You may suffer from grief, depressive symptoms, anxiety and/or anger afterwards, and that‚Äôs okay! 

PTSD is a mental illness/psychiatric disorder. It has its own specific set of symptoms, and it does not only describe adverse feelings after experiencing trauma. 

PLEASE quit telling people that they probably have PTSD when they haven‚Äôt given any information to indicate that. I understand that a lot of you are simply trying to validate others, but it can be *harmful*! If a person makes a post describing that they have just experienced something awful, they‚Äôre feeling stressed, overwhelmed, depressed, etc as a result, do not jump to conclusions. 

Saying ‚ÄúYep, you could definitely have PTSD‚Äù may sound synonymous with ‚Äúwow, that‚Äôs very traumatic. I hear you and your pain is valid,‚Äù but what you‚Äôre really saying is: ‚ÄúWow, you went through a very traumatic event and it sounds like you‚Äôve developed a mental disorder too.‚Äù *It is not always comforting!!* 

Truth be told, none of us are qualified to suggest diagnoses to others. None of us are qualified to tell someone if their trauma could or will develop into PTSD. Offer support, not psychiatric advice. It‚Äôs misleading and can be potentially harmful to a person who is already in a vulnerable state.",ptsd

"does anyone else get overwhelmed/feel weird during sex scenes in movies? cw: parental abuse implication, porn mention

i'm a 20 going on 21 year old man and i'm really embarrassed to admit this, but whenever there's a sex scene in a movie or even a really raunchy one (like in the lewd rom-coms, y'know? i can't explain it), i feel really... weird, like i want to crawl out of my skin. 

my parents like unwinding in the evenings with netflix and hulu, which is totally cool and natural-- but they always seem to gravitate to these kinds of movies. (both of them being sexual in front of me, my father in particular, is a separate issue that i won't get into here, mostly for the sake of brevity) my mom likes horror movies, and a lot of them have some pretty weird/fucked up sexual scenes. it's kind of a nightmare living in the same house as two people who always blare movies like this, if i'm being honest.

i also have a hard time watching porn because of this. this wasn't really a problem until earlier this year, and it doesn't really affect me as negatively as the stuff i mentioned in the previous paragraph, but i still thought it was worth mentioning.

I think he lost his parents in the store but I'm not sure. He turned, made eye contact with me, hugged me (or as much of me as he could reach from his height) and started crying. Long story short, I ended up on the floor right along with him, holding him and bawling my eyes out. 

This one lady walks by, looks at me, and says, ""What the fuck is wrong with you? What are you trying to accomplish? You want attention, well you got it - now what do you want?""

I could barely say anything but I managed to tell her that he reminded me of someone I'd met years ago. Something like that. I don't remember exactly what I said. 

She started yelling at me, saying how ""Everyone just wants to play the victim those days"" and all that.

"The Neurobiology of PTSD explained Hey yall! So I briefly wanted to explain some of the neurobiology behind ptsd, cus this will give insight and possibly allow you to make some good decisions regarding treatment. So essentially as you probably know, trauma puts us in a chronic fight flight freeze state. When were in fight or flight, our cortisol rises very high giving us the energy to do so. But after a certain point of too much stress, our cortisol downregulates and we freeze. Its our bodies way of saying, ""nope this is too much i cant fight anymore so this has to stop"". When were traumatized our bodies neurochemistry gets thrown way off, so we develop high levels of glutamate, norepinepherine and sometimes dopamine but not always. Our serotonin levels may drop as well as GABA cus when glutamate and norepinepherine go up, serotonin and gaba go down. So were constantly flooded with excitatory neurotransmitters and not enough inhibitory neurotransmitters.

Along with this, high levels of glutamate become excitotoxic, resulting in shrinking of the hippocampus and cell death in the brain. Yes, keeping our stress levels so high in ptsd can cause actual brain damage. Its why for so many people, lamictal/lamotrigine has helped immensely with their symptoms. It reduces glutamate which inadvertly reduces norepinepherine and allows serotonin and gaba to increase. 

Researchers hypothesize that the hyperarousal component of PTSD is mainly due to the high norepinepherine keeping us im an overly sensitive state. Some people have found relief in medications such as clonidine which lower norepinepherine.

Also researchers hypothesize that high amounts of  excitatory neurotransmitters may be the cause for dissociative states, because they keep the body constantly overstimulated.",ptsd

No place to go,

to dry her eyes, from the past which she hides,

she wipes her tears and braves the day

Trapped inside day after day,

she looks forward and sees his body,

lifeless, stone cold, eyes open, legs astray,

BROKEN INSIDE, NO PLACE TO GO IN HER MIND,

SHE TEARS HERSELF APART, TIME AFTER TIME,

seeing his body left and right,

she turns into herself and stabs her heart,

OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

screaming inside.

She's lost inside, doesn't know how to go forward,

she's lost inside, lost inside....

Open your eyes, and look to the present,

see the trees stand firm and present,

take a breath,

The anniversary of my SA and physical assault is next weekend. My partner has been with me for a few years and knew it was coming up.

"the body keeps the score and dry needling Probably if you've been in counseling for ptsd, you've heard of the book, or at least the concept that your body holds on to tension and trauma from the past. Yesterday, I went for dry needling therapy for a partial muscle tear and some muscle imbalances. Very painful therapy. They work on your trigger points by poking it with acupuncture needles. I could barely walk to transit after, and I cried the whole way. Yet, just before in the therapy session, the practioner seemed very impressed that I could take so much pain that he gave me extra needling up my spine and around my neck. I took an epsom salt bath that night, as recommended, for the soreness.

Today, I woke up and felt weird in my body. I sobbed for about 15 minutes. Then, I had a miraculous kind of feeling. An inzcredible lightness of being. Sort of like falling in love. It's the lack of tension around my heart. I was sort of scared to go to work because my emotional body armor was missing. I wasn't sure if I could be around people without that physical barrier. It's taken me years to build up such a thick layer of tension!!

Just wanted to share how ptsd manifests in my body.

Edit: Since the treatment I've found it a bit emotionally daunting to be so open. I'm crying a lot easier. FYI, one of my major symptoms of PTSD has been dissociation. I dissociate on a physical level and often won't notice an injury until I see it in the mirror, or somebody asks me about that bruise. It's a bit shocking to be alive in my body just a little bit more. I should probably pair this treatment with some counseling to help me adjust emotionally.

Thanks for all the comments!",ptsd

TW: I was at the scene of an accident and I‚Äôm traumatized. I was on my way home from work on the highway when I saw 4 cars stopped in front of me. I looked up about 10 feet and saw a woman lying in the road. She was changing a flat tire and was struck. The driver stayed at the scene and was on the phone with the police when I got to the scene. I rushed over to the woman and it was something I will never forget. Her right leg had been almost completely torn off from the groin and a fatty substance was spilling out of her body. She was somewhat conscious but in shock. Me and another woman kept telling her to open her eyes and look at the sky while two emts who happened to be driving by provided first aid.

Its interviews with people from all walks who have had difficult lives, addicts, gangsters, veterans, mobsters, sex workers etc most are traumatized and I suspect many have ptsd. It really helps me see things from others perspective and draw from their strengths, warning it can be quite intense and sad.

Anyways, one thing I've noticed is many of the people have this look in their eyes. They're intense, piercing but somewhat distant. It's like they contain pain, anger, resilience, strength, sincerity, longing and strange knowledge all at once. They look almost other worldly, beautiful and a little scary.

I see the same things in my eyes at times and wonder if this pushes 'normal' people away, has anyone else noticed a similar thing?

"I just need to tell someone TW: suicide attempt


My now wife attempted suicide 5 or so years ago by overdose. It was really serious. She was on life support for 9 days and then spent two more weeks in the ICU. 

I managed to get her to the hospital in time. I was with her in the ER. She was awake and talking fine and suddenly started seizing. They rushed me and her parents out of the room into this tiny private waiting area. We sat there waiting for hours. A doctor came in and said she might not make it through the night. She got put on life support. I practically lived at the ICU family room. I‚Äôve been told I fell asleep leaning on her bed. Her kidneys started failing and her whole body swelled up. They said if she survived she probably wouldn‚Äôt be the same mentally. 

She managed to make a miraculous recovery. Like an actual miracle. But her recovery was hard to watch. When she woke up it seemed like she was empty. I watched a nurse feed her soup and her eyes were just blank. You‚Äôd ask a question and she‚Äôd just nod to anything she said. She wasn‚Äôt able to talk for a while. Slowly she got more and more like herself. After that she couldn‚Äôt walk. They aren‚Äôt quite sure what happened, maybe the seizure, but her leg is fucked up. There‚Äôs extensive nerve and tendon damage. She‚Äôs able to walk ok now but it‚Äôs painful and she limps. Sometimes she needs a brace and a cane depending on how bad it is. She lost all of her memory from the year prior. She can‚Äôt remember all the good times from then. She doesn‚Äôt remember me proposing.

She‚Äôs completely back to normal now aside from the leg and some memory issues. I love her with everything in me. She‚Äôs my world. But the thoughts keep creeping back. I can see all of these things clearly in my head. The seizure, the doctor saying she might not make it, the respirator, the soup, the blank stare, all of it. It terrifies me. I want it to stop.

"Does anyone else find being in nature profoundly calming, healing and refreshing? I've been curious if anyone else has experienced this, and I would like to get feedback from not just nature lovers but those who aren't so bothered about nature either. So also If you aren't really a nature lover, if you have been in places like forests/woodlands or very wild/natural picturesque areas, have you nevertheless found any kind of healing or extreme calm simply by being in that environment? I tend to feel this strongly myself, though I know that I am a nature lover, so I'm curious if its just simply connected with my love of nature or whether it could be a universally healing thing independent of being a nature lover or not.

I suppose that because I have a lot of social anxiety, the remote nature of a lot of wild/nature environments give me a strong sense of peace and calm eventhough it is still ""outside"" and ""public"", and its very refreshing, like a reset button in some ways. I'm definitely not a ""new age"" type hippy person but I find it profoundly uplifting and calming. I know that some people have investigated what some have termed forest therapy or forest bathing.

My foster parents gaslit me and my brother too, and they still stand by that they were the victims somehow even though CPS determined them to be neglectful too and took my brother out of their home (I‚Äôd already aged out).

I was just completely discarded, with no explanation, and now I have to watch how he chose this other chick who‚Äôs even an anti-masker and anti-vaxxer instead of me . 

I messaged him a few months ago and told him how much what he did to me made me spiral down and how much trauma it caused for me. And he somehow doesn‚Äôt think he did anything to hurt me.

"Crazy neighbour doesn't beleive me about my child!!! TRIGGER WARNING!!!  

**backstory: so, i was r\*p\*d when i was 13 by my step-dad, i got pregnant and i chose to keep the baby. i moved in with my girlfriend and her parents. I am now 16 and my son Logan is now 19 months. It was not my choice to have him, but it was my choice to keep him. and he is the best thing that has ever happened to me.**

**story: My girlfriend's parents (who I live with) moved into a house which is two 4 bedroom houses connected together by a small door downstairs. Me and my girlfriend live together in one of the houses, and her parents live in the other. in our house we each have our own bedrooms, but tend to sleep in the same room, with Logan. he has his room which is more of a playroom at the moment because he still sleeps in a cot in our room. my gf takes pride in the fact that she always keeps the house clean and loves to clean. also, we still technically live with her parents.**

**we have regular social services visits to make sure that we are all OK because we are so young, she is 16 as well. our neighbours (not her parents but the ones next to us on our side) are entitled parents. and this week came to our house about 10 minutes before a social service visit. they started screaming at us for having a child so young. i have extreme social anxiety and ptsd from when i got pregnant with him. I don't tell anyone that i don't trust completely about his father. so our neighbours don't know about the circumstances about him.**

**on this particular day she sees me and my gf playing with our son in the garden. he is only wearing his underwear because it is a hot day and he is in the pool. and he has plenty of sun-cream on. she comes knocking on my gfs parents door. her parents tell her that we live next-door not with them. she comes and knocks on our door and is shouting about how we shouldn't be living on our own, and we should have a responsible adult in the house. she then starts shouting about how we probably abuse Logan. she then asks how old i am and i tell her i'm 16, she slaps me and tells me that i am way too young to have a child and that i'm lying to her about him being my son. i tell her that he is my son and i was just young when i had him. she slaps me again and calls the police telling them that I've kidnapped a child. i start having a flashback because it was a very triggering situation. she then starts saying that our house is a mess. my gf was so angry but at this point is focusing on my more than the woman. then she sees my son and accuses us of sexually abusing him because he is only wearing his underwear! this is too much for me and i pass out because that can happen in ptsd. once I had come around and calmed down the woman started telling me i was overreacting. so i just turned around and told her the truth ""I WAS RAPED, I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO DO IT! IT WASN'T MY FAULT"" remember i'm 16 so this was a pretty scary situation for me in this moment. the crazy neighbour looks horrified and starts calling me all sorts of racial and religious slurred. ( which doesn't make sense because i am white french living in England!) also, i am still in my wheelchair because i was using it in the garden, so she kicks my wheelchair and breaks it!**

**i turn around and the social worker had seen it all. the social worker explained to them woman that i was a teen parent, and then the police arrested the crazy neighbour! social services took her kids off of her during the trial! i pressed chargers and she was fined. she did get her kids back but she never bothered us again after that. all is going well now and social services were very happy about how we handled the situation!**",ptsd

"My dad is using my dead grandfather to guilt me into being polite to my violently sexually abusive brother over Christmas. My dad called me the other day to tell me some news, my molester brother was coming to Christmas with his partner and my Dad was wondering if I would be able to handle it ‚Äòwithout making a scene‚Äô. ‚ÄòEveryone will be there including (sisters boyfriend)‚Äô. ‚ÄòIt would mean a lot to mom to have all of her children under one roof.‚Äô He continued, \*\*‚Äôbefore grandpa died he said, ‚Äúall I want is peace in the family‚Äù, and that‚Äôs what I want.\*\*

My brother used violence to coerce me to commit sexual acts on him from the time i was 5-14 and he was 11-20. When I told my school guidance councillor she was mandated to report it and an investigation was initiated. On the morning of my first interview with the police my dad took me to breakfast at my favour restaurant in our small town, where he said, ‚Äúyou can either put your brother in jail, or you can keep the family together.‚Äù I lied to the police, told them I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. The investigation went away. My parents never punished Nick, when the investigation was over they let him pick any city in the US and they would help him move there. He picked NYC. That was 11 years ago.

Ive kept my silence to keep the family together. My parents keep reminding me in our bi/trimonthly family fights that ‚Äòthere was nothing we could do.‚Äô and \*\*‚Äòthere will be no more family if you keep up with this.‚Äô\*\*

My brother is always playing the saint and they just fawn over how success and accomplished he is. He‚Äôs seen as the darling helper who could do no wrong.

Whenever I try to talk to my family about what he did they tell me, ‚ÄòTell your therapist that, not us.‚Äô

In my Mom and I‚Äôs most recent fights, she let out a tirade of ‚Äòwhy didn‚Äôt you tell me it was happening? why didn‚Äôt you tell me one time?‚Äô And then followed that up with, ‚ÄòWhen I was a little girl I prayed to God that I would have kids, but now after all of this I wish I Never was a Mom.‚Äô

I have been trying to go NC with my brother but my family doesn‚Äôt seem to respect that. I often get texts from him in the family group text saying overly positive shit like nothings up. He‚Äôs coming to Christmas, and my parents wanted me to go on a trip with everyone else including him and his girlfriend where I would be expected to ‚ÄòNot make a scene.‚Äô

I need some sort of grounding because I‚Äôve been keeping quiet with this hell of family and rape for 21 years, first so my brother wouldent get in trouble, and secondly so my parents wouldent look bad to their family and friends.

The biggest hypocrisy of this is that I was sexually abused as a child by another perpetrator. A older man who abused me for 2 years concurrently with the time I was being abused at home. I told my mom what had happened, he then was charged and convicted and sentenced to jail. I had my parents full support then. I told my parents about this man abusing me in particular first so they would know how to handle my brother. Turns out they didn‚Äôt. I am still glad I told them in that order, because if I had told them about my brother and then the older man they would have covered up both, and I likely would have killed myself from the stress that I otherwise barely survived.

Giving me a blanket to sleep with when I was really sick. I can't stop. I literally catch my brain thinking that this dude loved me and I'm really sad that I'll never be able to see him again. Which is probably the most fucked up thing I've ever thought in my life. Seriously. This man killed my daughter and essentially ruined my life, but my brain is somehow trying to convince me that he loved me???? It makes me nauseous that I could even think that, but somehow it creeps back in. 

I've told a couple people in my life about these feelings and everyone is like ""dude, that's fucked up. How??"". I don't know how?!? I'm crazy. I don't know. I guess i just wanted to share with some people who might understand. I am hoping these weird feelings pass quickly and never come back. Jesus. ",ptsd

"I hate the way PTSD has been oversimplified Sorry this really isn‚Äôt supposed to be mean, just a vent. Let me preface with saying that this isn‚Äôt about posts in this sub, more so just stuff I come across in various other outlets. And I don‚Äôt blame the individuals for this way of thinking, rather I think as a society need to be collectively better educated on mental health. But anyways‚Ä¶I hate how simplistic PTSD is viewed as at times. People will say something or post somewhere online being like, ‚ÄúI had a suspicious group of people bang on my windows a few weeks ago. I think I might have PTSD because now I get anxious every time I‚Äôm home alone.‚Äù (using an example of something that actually happened to me not someone else because I feel like that‚Äôd be unnecessarily mean, and no this isn‚Äôt what caused my PTSD lol). I feel sympathy for the person, I hope their anxiety heals soon and I know it‚Äôs not their intention or their fault but it just feels like being punched in the gut.

I feel like so many people have boiled PTSD down to an adverse reaction to something when it‚Äôs actually a multifaceted disorder. Also yes, trauma is subjective but there does need to be some real layer of threat there for it to even get to the level of it turning into PTSD. Like I can assure you, you don‚Äôt have PTSD from falling out with a friend (unless it was an abusive relationship or something). A degree of change is normal to an extent after a scary or unpleasant event.

I just feel like the disorder itself is a battle. Not sleeping, nightmares, anger‚Ä¶So it sucks when it gets oversimplified. It makes me scared people won‚Äôt take me seriously, either. Again, I don‚Äôt blame the people. I just feel frustrated with the misrepresentation of this disorder.",ptsd

"Has PTSD played a part in you walking away from God? I was raised in a ""Christian home"", and for many years I believed in the theology that I was taught from a young age. However, due to incidents that happened to me during my childhood and my adult life I found it put strain on my religious beliefs. They're not the only reason I turned away from God, as I've put myself into the agnostic category because of faults I've found with Christianity, as well as the idea of a personal God. But my personal reasons have nonetheless played a part in it. How could they not?

Even if there is a personal God (as in a God that cares about you and what you do, listens to your prayers, etc) I've found the idea of wanting to having a relationship with him to be (for lack of a better word) difficult. I have a friend who I sometimes talk to, and her advice usually goes something like this: 

\- God loves us. He will make something good out of all of this suffering.

\- God is good.

\- Trust. Believe. Keep the faith.

These phrases sound inspiring, but I find them to be shallow and simple. I think it's easy for a person who does well in life, or goes through something hard and comes out better for it to give thanks to God. But what about all of the people God doesn't help? Everyday, as I drive to or from work, I see homeless people sitting on the side of the road living in tents, I hear about people being raped and murdered on the news. I hear about people being kidnapped and being held for years against their will. I see greedy politicians on TV who are legally stealing from the citizens they are supposed to serve. I see war and disease. 

Perhaps I'm jaded, but I find this constant rat race we're in to be tiring. 

If there is a God, I find myself not wanting anything to do with him anymore. I don't want to worship him, I don't want to know him. At one time I may have. But I found him to be rather impersonal for a God who is supposedly personal. Where were you God? Where were you when I was being abused? Why didn't you stop it, or give me the strength to stop it on my own? And after each time, as the abuse happened over and over again, you expect me to come crawling back to you looking for love and protection and a relationship? I don't want to. I'm sorry God, but I don't love you. I don't love your creation. I don't want to be a part of it. I didn't ask for this. I have so much hate and disgust in me that I want nothing to do with you. And yes, I guess according to Christianity I may go to Hell for saying that. But you know what? When I die, I don't want an afterlife. I don't want your Heaven or your Hell.

"How a PTSD attack works This is an educational post for those that think anxiety and trauma is cute and romanticize it. Read with care. 
TW: MENTIONS OF TRAUMA AND ABUSE

I‚Äôve been sexually assaulted and psychologically abused by my parents. I‚Äôm triggered by sexual abuse (or mentions of it), mentions of trauma, people raising their voices at me, when people pretend to throw things at me or harm me, and loud noises (such as doors slamming, crowds, screaming and yelling). 

When I have an attack I hide myself in a ball and I cry with my hands in my ears to protect myself from the noise. If someone tries to touch me during an attack I scream and I harm people unintentionally. I shake, I go pale, my heart races, my memories go back, the flashbacks go even stronger, my paranoia goes insane, and I can‚Äôt move at all. 

It‚Äôs not cool. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúcute UwU so anxious‚Äù. My social interactions are affected by this. I‚Äôm scared to get out of my house alone. I‚Äôm extremely paranoid and I always walk around with a weapon or something to defend myself. My life is hard. Don‚Äôt make it seem cute. I suffer.",ptsd
"I hate Christmas I will try and keep this short. I (30yof f) hate Christmas with a passion. When I was 12yo my alcoholic mother and step dad arrived home with my 4yo brother at 1am on Christmas day. I put him to bed and they were so drunk the inevitable fight broke out. I was in the living room wrapping my brothers presents because they hadn't bothered. 3 times I went into the kitchen to tell them to stop. The 4th time I walked in just before she picked up the knife and stabbed him. Punched his lung. I screamed and she followed me out of the room. A few mins later he was calling her back in. Our massive kitchen was covered in blood and she rushed him to the hospital. I didn't want my brother to wake up and see it so I cleaned it up. I was covered in blood. I hid the clothes, showered and waited. 
She came home and spent the next few hours telling me I would have to raise my brother because she was going to jail for murder. They lied to the police and made me lie to everyone in the family. I found out years later that they were aloud to tell people about it but me being a stupid kid never did. 
I have other mental health issues and this time of year brings it all back. The nightmares start in September when the Christmas crap starts appearing. I wish I could hide from the whole season. I don't know why I'm venting hear I just feel like shit!

"My dad is trying to force me to re-traumatize myself bc he's too afraid to tell his wife the truth Trigger warning: CSA

My step brother molested me when I was 10 years old. We were on a family vacation and he snuck up on me in bed and messed with me.

I kept it a secret forever bc I was mortified. I tried to tell my older brother once, and he didn't say anything to anyone either so I gave up for a while. I eventually told my mom, who immediately told my dad by bitching him out. As far as I can recall, nothing came out of this either bc I was still forced to visit my dad every other weekend and still forced to be sleeping in the same house as this guy until I was 18. 

I definitely developed PTSD and never realized it most my life until I started going to therapy as a 30+ adult. This has caused me so much shame, guilt, re-traumatization, sleepless nights, relationship issues, suicidal thoughts, etc.. You guys know what I mean.

Fast forward to 2019, and I find out from my aunt that my dad is intending to have my step brother over for our family gathering to celebrate my dad and my Nana's bdays (mind you, the rest of the family don't like him either for various reasons like him calling my brother fat and other charming things like that) so I called my dad and let him know how that makes me feel and how I can't be around that guy ever again. Didn't work, had to see the guy, sucked ass for me, etc.

Fast forward to Father's day last night. We're at dinner, and my dad brings up the topic. We're about to have our family gathering for dad/Nana's bday again in a couple of weeks. Dad wants to know how we can ""resolve this."" I tell him that I WON'T be in the same place as my step brother anymore, and that if he intends on having him there, I won't be going. My dad spins a sad tale about how my step brother is getting divorced and only gets to see the kids at certain times and blah blah blah. Basically, he knows his wife wants to have my step bro over that weekend, and he wants to know how he can make it as comfortable as possible for himself. I was under the impression that he told his wife about it in 2019 bc she was in the fucking background, but apparently not and now he's asking me to tell her. 

So now, my father has set me up to re-traumatize myself by telling my story again to my step mother (who has shown support for public figures having allegations against them and blamed victims) about what her son did to me. He was nice enough (sarcasm) to prepare me by saying ""I really don't know what she's going to say to you, she might blow up."" 

If I don't tell her, then my step bro will most certainly be at the party, and I'll either need to be around him again or miss one of my favorite events bc my out of town family will be here to visit.

Thanks for anyone who made it this far.. would definitely be open to any advice if anyone has any.... üò≠

I really needed to hear them because when I'm around him, I tend to cower and let him get away with murder.

"Stopped a Panic Artack in its tracks! I was at the dentist office with my son, and a very angry man came in to complain to the management.  A petite woman came out to talk to this tall guy, and he kept shutting her down - cutting her off, interrupting, raising his voice.

I got triggered hard.  Started hyperventilating, heart started racing.  I tried the ask them guy to have a seat, because he was elderly and using a walker.  He refused, saying he was too mad to sit.  So then I just came right out and told him ‚Äúlisten, I know you‚Äôre mad - it‚Äôs palpable and I can feel it all the way over here- but could you do me a favor, and maybe sit down for a second?  You‚Äôre triggering my PTSD from working with the Army, and I would really appreciate it if your could bring yoir volume down a bit too please.‚Äù

After that, the office lady came to escort him into an office - and asked if I would like to go into one when he loudly refused too.  She could tell I was shook.  I decided to go Outside instead.  Then I decided to LEAN INTO the panic attack (I was crying and shaking and it was hard to breathe).  I just started a YouTube channel on talking openly about mental
Health issues and how I deal with my conditions as naturally as possible.  So I got my phone out and FILMED my Panic Attack - and how I was able to calm Myself down.  

And it worked!  I got out my essential oils and worry stone and did deep breathing and practiced gratitude.  My panic attack went away, and I was able to go back into the office and not feel like a complete loser for losing my shit in there.

"Family makes fun of my triggers I grew up with an alcoholic and drug addicted father. He was never physically abusive towards me but I've had a lot of traumatic experiences of him high out of his mind,  driving drunk,  having a psychotic episode,  slamming things,  etc.

One of my triggers is when my family is heavily under the influence. If they're just tipsy it's fine but if they start acting delirious then I get really anxious. Anyway, last year my mom decided she wanted to try an edible (weed). My brother told her to eat a whole cookie. I was begging her to only take a piece of it (300mg cookie!!).

Anyways she took it and my brother went off to a party so I was home alone with my mom, who of course got insanely high. She was basically stoned on the couch speaking nonsense to herself and her mouth was so dry, her eyes were so red etc. In a certain way this image is funny, and that's how my mom and my brother see it.

"I was raped in a fucking hospital. I only ever tell this story in two different halves.

The first half is about how I ended up in the hospital. I almost died. I experienced what it's like to know that you're about to die, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. 

0/10. Would not recommend.

The second half is about what I woke up to a day later. In the dim night, when everyone else was gone. Having to limp out of the hospital in pain. Remembering hands, and the other person, and the giddy-with-insanity-as-it-broke-my-brain realization that nobody was going to come and save me. That this was just going to happen. Trying to sit up. Being pushed back down. Passing back out.

I was 18.

Some completely pulverized piece of me will never accept that this actually happened. What goes hand in hand with that is the irrational, unshakeable certainty that nobody will ever believe me. Despite that already not being true.

At first, I told myself it was because hospitals had to have cameras in those rooms. This couldn't have happened. Then I told myself that my parents would've been there overnight.

Neither of that's true.

And the risk of false memory syndrome doesn't explain the pain.

Or the fact that a serial rapist who worked around that hospital went on trial less than 2 years later, and he looked like every shard of memory that I have.

It's many years later, now. 

Things are usually better than this.

But it's a month from the time this happened, and I'm drinking tonight. A lot. And I just want to say it. The truth. To someone besides my wife.

*This happened.*

Even though the chances of it happening were infinitesimal. 

Statistically, false memory syndrome is infinitely more likely.

But false memories don't leave you checking for blood because you're in so much fucking goddamn pain that you're shaking at having to use the fucking bathroom.

I don't know what anyone can say back to this. I don't know what there is to say. 

*I* don't know what to say about it.

How could you?

The next time I woke up, it was the most beautiful day you've ever seen in your life. There was a huge window in the room, and a phenomenal view of the city and the rolling hills.

Now I have to put up blackout curtains on beautiful springtime days. Because the sunlight is radioactive. It makes me start throwing up before I realize why I'm sick. Every tired fucking year. Despite meds that do help, and therapists who've never been worth a damn.

I stood at that window, just staring out of it. Pathologically docile. I said yes to everyone. I told them everything they wanted to hear. I was human putty, spineless and soft.

Because all I could think was ""I want to go home.""

*Please, let me go home. Please, I need a shower. I feel disgusting. Everything feels disgusting. Please don't force me to stay here.*

When I finally finished jumping through hoops, and went home? 

They guilted me for the cost of the ambulance they'd called to save my life.

I went upstairs. I finally got to take a shower. 

And as soon as I got into it, all I could do was cry.

No, I'm not stable right now. Yes, I'm weird and broken and pathetic.

But you know what? If anyone else had to live through this shit, along with everything that came before it, and everything that came after it? They would be too.

I have several close friends who are deeply interested in serial killers and true crime. They even have ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù serial killers. Now, I‚Äôm open to the idea that the psychology behind why people commit crimes could be fascinating. 

However, I find it disgusting when people are buying clothing with pictures of serial killers on it. It‚Äôs not edgy or quirky. It‚Äôs glorifying them. They are NOT celebrities and the only acceptable place for their faces is on the bottom of your shoe. 

As someone who was the victim of a violent crime-as someone who truly believed I was going to be killed by my rapist (a stranger whom I trusted to help me, who held me captive overnight) I can‚Äôt stand how people romanticize violent people like Ted Bundy, Ed Kemper, and Brian Laundrie right now. Murder, rapes, attacks, and the investigations that follow are messy, gritty, and sad. 

True crime treats the victims of trauma like characters in a story. Imagine if your trauma, or abuser, or rapist, was glorified. Victims are eventually reduced down to names and ages. The offender gets some sort of sick celebrity status and a movie deal on Netflix 

I just think it‚Äôs so unfair to the victims who are no longer living, to the family of victims, and to future victims of abuse, rape, and murder.

I‚Äôve lived three lifetimes in such a short amount of time. I‚Äôve been through more but also lived so much more than some people twice my age and certainly more than a lot of 20-somethings. What is also contributing is that because of college and the trauma that happened there, the last few years have been a blur... like how am I already 24? I know mentally that I‚Äôm not old.

"A lesson from someone who lost their battle to PTSD. Hello. I was diagnosed officially I think a few months ago, probably actually had it for longer. My trauma stemmed from a relationship, but that‚Äôs not important. I took literally all the wrong routes on the road to recovery. I‚Äôm at the end of my road now. I‚Äôm fresh out of energy. Hurt. Hopeless. My only solace is since I screwed up an extreme amount, I can impart a lot of knowledge on to others. 

First, stay the fuck away from drugs. Especially the ones people tell you to , you know, stay away from. They‚Äôll make you feel great, amazing. Then you‚Äôll need them to function. Life without them will be so, so dull. It‚Äôs like having a heavy suitcase you never knew you was carrying taken away from you. Just... don‚Äôt. Please.

Second, never, ever RELY on one person. I did. Said they‚Äôd be there for me while I healed. Said they‚Äôd love me. Said they‚Äôd even help me get comfortable back on my campus. They ghosted around 4 days ago. A friend shown me their Tinder today. Of course, accept help. Love. Live life. But relying on someone like that, EXPECTING them to always be there, is a disaster. You need to be fully capable of being alone. I have no idea how to do this 

Third, keep trying meds. Switch therapists if it calls for it. Try, try, try. Misery is such an easy thing to get comfortable with. Keep moving. Always improve.",ptsd
"Was diagnosed with PTSD as a teenager, never really took the diagnosis seriously until now as a young adult. Anyone else unable to remember the majority of their childhood? I just, can‚Äôt remember it. I know it happened obviously, but I have very scattered memories just kinda sprinkled throughout ages. I remember practically nothing from up to around age 8. One really horrific memory from around 8 or 9. Then scattered blips of memories till around 16. And then  a couple more fully formed memories from 16-18, where I can distinctly remember how I felt and most of what happened. But still can‚Äôt remember the majority of all of it. I mostly remember things from age 19 to now, where I was out of the trauma itself and on my own. And a lot of it isn‚Äôt even remotely happy, but I remember pretty much all of it.

Is this normal or is it part of the ptsd? I didn‚Äôt even remember I was diagnosed with ptsd until around a month ago, when I realized what‚Äôs been happening to me is flashbacks. I wish the therapist I‚Äôd seen when I was little would have helped me with it, since now I feel like I‚Äôve blocked everything out. 

The one memory I have from around age 8 was unearthed really suddenly during a therapy session last year. And even then the therapist I had had never mentioned that the episode I had in his office could have been ptsd.",ptsd
"I have episodes where if someone touches me, even my SO, I have a mini panic attack. Can anyone relate? I haven‚Äôt been able to find much information about this online, so I‚Äôm reaching out to this community. I have sexual trauma from a couple years ago and it has been getting worse recently. 

One of the worst symptoms is that when my boyfriend touches me I just can‚Äôt handle it sometimes. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be in a sexual way - even if we‚Äôre just cuddling, I‚Äôll suddenly become aware of his hands on me and I have this feeling that‚Äôs hard to describe. It‚Äôs an awful combination of disgust and anger. 

I can still feel it after he stops and moves away from me, and it makes me want to rip my skin off in that area. It makes me feel bad because he‚Äôs always respectful of my boundaries and I trust him completely, but these episodes still happen randomly. 

Sometimes they last for a full day after it happens, and it‚Äôs hard for me to even take a shower because being naked makes me uncomfortable. Even if it‚Äôs just me by myself. I have obsessive thoughts about the trauma that are so vivid I can almost feel it happening again. 

I feel really weird about it, and the fact that I haven‚Äôt been able to find anything online makes me feel worse. Can anyone relate? Thanks.",ptsd

In theory, it could make sense, but I guess I just doubt myself.

What does C-PTSD look like for you and how does it interact with your daily life? You could talk about things both big and small, but either is valid.

It triggers me so bad because loud noises are harmful to my mind. Yesterday there was a panela√ßo, I was having a dinner, I didn't know it was about to happen, I got so messed up. A guy was screaming through a speaker, it was hell for me. 

I can't stop thinking about other people bothered by this. Old people, disabled people, babies, animals, etc... 

I opened reddit to distract myself and I saw this panela√ßo video, I commented there with my point and  I even exposed myself saying ""I'm someone with PTSD, this is just my point of view"". Everyone there is being so mean, I'm so sad. Why people gotta be that way? 

Specially ""progressive"" people, I'm so sad about them, you'd hope progressive folks be more understanding but hell no.

Both are mostly under control. I still have some days where they flare up and some self-destructive behaviour, and I do always have problems sleeping still.

A few people in the past have commented on how bad my memory is on just normal day to day stuff. One example is I was talking to a friend about their parents dog on a couple of occasions, and I asked him 3 times what the breed of dog it was.

However this is also a big time for me. I'm trying to quit self harm, trying to get a job and eventually move out. All of which are incredibly stressful. When I'm out on my own I'll not be able to afford a trauma therapist, at least not for a long while. So it's now or never. 

The difficult bit is that even lightly touching it is enough to put me out of commission for basically a day to two, sometimes more.

We have talked about what happened before and she‚Äôs normally ok with it . But she does bring it up often . But she never seems really upset or triggered by it when she talks about 
But on Saturday we went to this sandwich place called Firehouse subs and for some unknown reason they sandwich place was playing videos over and over of what firemen do and how great they are but the video kept talking about accidents and fires and how in one crash 2 people died but that the person was so thankful for the firefighters who helped 
 It kept playing sirens over and over and at the same time my in-laws were talking about a crash they saw last week .

And out of no where my 7 year old starts screaming and saying she‚Äôs really scared and the sirens are scaring her and wanted me to make it stop :( she wouldn‚Äôt calm down. I was already getting triggered as well but didn‚Äôt want to make a scene 
I gave my daughter my headphones and let her watch bluey and she started to calm down .
When we got home she told me how scared the sounds made her feel and that she just remembers the accident and how scary it was . And she kept seeing the accident :( ! I feel TERRIBLE she had never brought up these feelings till now . 

I want to call her and see what they think but I also don‚Äôt want to make her talk about it if it will trigger her more . This is so confusing to me especially since she‚Äôs just a kid :( idk how to handle it

"I disclosed 

Wednesday evening I had a guy I‚Äôve been seeing the last month or so come over to my place. We‚Äôd slept together before, and I‚Äôd already felt relatively safe, but this time I got triggered. I don‚Äôt know why, maybe it was the stress, but when he bit my leg (something I usually enjoy) I triggered, and I started flailing and kicking, then rolled over on my side and covered my face. He was gentle and checked on me and I apologized, and he pulled me in to cuddle. After I calmed down a bit, I said something about how we should talk about it, he said that we didn‚Äôt have to. 

I don‚Äôt disclose. I was in denial of my rapes and abuse for years, and when it all came out I told my boyfriend at the time. We‚Äôd been together for years, we lived together, I completely believed that he was going to be supportive. Instead he verbally abused me for hours, told me I was a slut and a liar and other horrible things. I have struggled with disclosure ever since, and have missed out on potential relationships because my fear of disclosing makes me disconnected and withdrawn. Disclosure is a huge barrier for me. 

But I disclosed. I had to work myself up to it, and he was patient. He already knew I had ptsd, so I said ‚Äúmy ptsd comes from sexual assault and domestic violence.‚Äù I talked a little about it and explained my reaction. I had to work myself up to it, but I did it. I was still very activated so I put on music and told him we should talk about other things to distract me, so he let me show him all my gemstones I recently got. He literally listened to me talk about rocks. I managed to pull myself back and finish having sex with him, and he was gentle even though I knew it wasn‚Äôt his preference. I kept apologizing to him about everything that happened and he told me it was okay, and to stop apologizing. 

This is a huge event for me. Disclosure to a sexual partner has never been successful for me. Most of the time it doesn‚Äôt happen. Potential relationships have been impaired by my avoidance. Disclosure itself carries trauma for me. I‚Äôve been talking in therapy about how to disclose for years. So this is a big deal for me. And I‚Äôm proud of me.

"Tomorrow is the 16th anniversary of the worst game of Hide and Seek I‚Äôve ever played. (T.w. Child abuse, animal abuse) March 16th, also known as the anniversary of when I got my last D on a report card. 

WARNING: This gets really dark really fast, so the faint of heart should turn back. 

*My dad was a bit of a drinker.*

I was in third grade. I was a bit of trouble child (mostly a slacker) in school. Not at home. God forbid. I hid my report card and he found it. On his birthday. My sister told me he found it so I hid outside. Big mistake. 

Worst hide and seek game ever. He came outside with his shotgun. He went to my pet rooster, who shares my very rare name, and shot his head off. ‚ÄúThe mutt is next if you don‚Äôt get your ass out here!‚Äù I continued to watch from my spot in the bush. My dog was indeed next. I cried out and he found me. He chased me across the yard and tackled me. 

After carrying me inside by  the back of my neck, he broke my nose on a wall. Blood spouted from my nose, down the pale yellow wallpaper, and seeped into the carpet. Told me I‚Äôm a failure. Shoved my bloody nose back into the wall and brought out ‚ÄúThe Slapper,‚Äù a leather belt he carved up and kept in a bucket of water; you know, for these special occasions. He made me stand with my arms out, moving them up and down. For three hours. ‚ÄúIf I could do this in football practice you can do it now!‚Äù 

(Yeah, that high school you dropped out of in 10th grade?) 

Periodically he‚Äôd come over and tire his arm out with that belt. Blood covered me. My face, my spiderman shirt, my blue shorts, socks. But the back was the worst. He didn‚Äôt go for my ass. Lacerations covered my tiny back. Blood slicked the back of my shirt and shorts. I still have the scars. 

(I *used* to be reminded every time I look in the mirror. I‚Äôve healed enough now to see myself as who I truly am and not the helpless, abhorrent, bastard abomination they tried to mold me into.) 

After I missed dinner and said I was hungry, he threw my rooster‚Äôs head at me and told me to eat it if I was really that hungry. I wasn‚Äôt. 

He made me clean the blood until I passed out at 3am. The next day, he cooked my favorite meal, took me fishing, and bought me an RC car; unheard of. 



So yeah, that‚Äôs a bit much for‚Ä¶ what a seven year old? 

That anniversary is tomorrow. 

I‚Äôve missed almost a week of work and have ignored all my responsibilities. Outwardly I seem fine and happy and enjoying our new puppy. But inside idk how I feel. It‚Äôs a mix of ‚Äúwhy tf can‚Äôt I have a decent family‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy tf do people keep treating me like shit.‚Äù Anger, humiliation, deep sadness, self disgust, and negative self talk have inhabited my brain while I sit and play Skyrim for hours on end. I‚Äôve had night terrors for the past week as well. 

I told my fianc√© the whole story today. She held me tightly afterwards and we sobbed together. She noticed that I still blame myself. ‚ÄúI should have done better in school.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I came out of my hiding place I could have saved my dog.‚Äù Sounds absurd hearing it aloud. My father was a deranged maniac, none of that was my fault. He killed other pets of mine, it was inevitable. I never deserved this. 

She suggested that we both write letters to our younger selves, and no matter how painful or uncomfortable, we will share them with each other. I might share mine on here later, who knows. 

I love this woman to death. She‚Äôs a ride or die kinda gal and she‚Äôs always had my back. I‚Äôm going to marry her ass so hard. 



Post Script: 
To give some people a sense of relief: I was saved when I was in fourth grade. Adopted into a semi-functional family. This certainly wasn‚Äôt the only event in my childhood, but through therapy and meds, I have healed immensely. Additionally, I have a great support system.

"My husband is triggering trauma responses and refuses to attend marriage counseling to work on things. How can I work on things? I, 26f, have been together with my husband, 31m, for about 4 years and married for 1. In the year we have been married, it has felt like a steady decline in our relationship. We have been fighting to an increasing degree to where I sometimes dread coming home. 

Most of my grievances come from feeling that my boundaries are not being respected. I am a survivor of childhood abuse and sexual assault, so physical intimacy can be very challenging for me, especially if I don't feel my boundaries are being respected. My husband has stated that he views my trauma responses as me being ""cold and frigid"" and that I just need to ""suck it up and get over it"".

What I don't understand is that he never complained about how affectionate I am before we got married and I never changed my habits. After months of him telling me I am never affectionate, I started tracking how often I am affectionate each day and made an effort to be more affectionate. When we got into another argument about it and he made the statement that I am ""never"" affectionate once again, I pointed out how often I am affectionate, and the efforts I have made to increase this. He stated that it wasn't good enough and that it should just be whenever he wants the attention and affection, as he views this as my duty as his wife.

He is very forceful and confrontational when he seeks any kind of affection, and while I try not to make him feel rejected, the way he forces himself on me is very hard for me to handle when it causes so much stress, anxiety and traumatic flash backs. He was never like this before we got married. And he knew from the beginning that I struggled with PTSD. I never hid it from him. Now, sometimes it almost feels like he's trying to provoke this kind of reaction from me.

I have tried to communicate how I feel in non confrontational ways and explain to him the logical reasons for my reactions when he violates my boundaries, however my husband refuses to acknowledge any accountability for his words and actions. I have asked him several times over the last few months to go to marriage counseling with me so we can work on our marriage, however, he adamantly refuses. 

My husband has flat out told me that he believes that he has never done anything wrong and that if I find any issue in our marriage it is my problem. That our arguments are solely my fault, and that I need to ""get over"" my ""issues"" and ""get on some meds"". 

I'm honestly at a loss at this point and I feel devastated and ashamed that my marriage has fallen to this point. I've only confided in one close friend about all of this, but they're at as much of a loss for what to do as I am. I couldn‚Äôt bear the shame and embarrassment of getting a divorce. My husband is all I have since my family disowned me for marrying him, but I don't know how much longer I can live this way. I've started to reach a point where I just don't know how I feel about him anymore. What do I do to work on things when he won't go to marriage counseling? 


TL,DR: My husband will not respect my boundaries and insists that in spite of the constant fighting we do not need marriage counseling because the only problem with our marriage is me. How do I work on repairing our marriage when he won't participate in counseling?

Edit 1: Thank you everyone for the responses. I appreciate the advice. I would like to clarify, as I've seen a lot of replies encouraging me to get back in contact qith my family, that it's not an option. My mother is a narcissistic abuser who was abusive to me my entire life and is a big reason I struggle with CPTSD. I had to cut contact after she began harassing me for marrying my husband as she is a racist and does not approve of his race. It never had anything to do with how my husband treats me. Going no contact with my family was a long time coming.",ptsd
"""We're helping victims of any crime, but unfortunately you've experienced the wrong kind of crime"" I'm super mad right now. I've finally managed to call one of the biggest organisations in countries that supports victims of pretty much any crime. 
I've used their online counseling before cause it's easier to write than to talk, and because I was unsure if they even deal with the kind of violence I've experienced. The counselor said they do, and I should contact the local team for in depth cooperation. 


Turns out, they don't. I've experienced the wrong kind of crime, the wrong kind of violence and there is no support system for me. Their website says that they don't compare or judge between victims of different crimes and support everyone. They fucking need to add a disclaimer with the exceptions.

"I'm a victim of a sex trafficking ring and am looking for other survivors, no idea how to handle the PTSD and intrusive thoughts I was a human trafficking victim in 2015-2017. I reported everything to local police, they didn't do much. No arrest no conviction at all. There are no survivors' groups in my province, no non-profit to help with dealing with the aftermath of leaving sex exploitation. Would anyone be willing to talk with me about this? I know there is other people going through the same thing I am and I'm afraid to talk about it on my other social media.

"Is it possible to forget a trauma experience but have PTSD? Just as the title says. To preface, I AM diagnosed with PTSD and do have a set of trauma experiences I can recall vividly and experience PTSD symptoms around, but I keep feeling this bugging feeling that something in my early childhood has been extremely traumatic and that I have yet to remember it/can‚Äôt remember it. I‚Äôll get all the symptoms of being triggered at any mention of childhood or childhood trauma, even if it‚Äôs not even about me but just any random child, it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt listen without feeling triggered by it even though I‚Äôm a 22 year old adult now. I also just have extreme anxiety and fear surrounding my childhood (will have outbursts of fear and crying hysterically about it) but I ironically have memory loss of a majority of my life before the age of 18, except for quick snippets at random intervals. 

Has anyone experienced this? Does it come back to you eventually? Is it better forgotten? If it‚Äôs forgotten but the feeling is there, do I tell my therapist?

"I lost my femininity Tw - sexual assault

Ever since my rape I have been slowly losing my femininity. It's been just over a year (it happened December 2018) and I just realized how truly painful it is for me to wear or do anything remotely feminine. I was dressed up for a night out with friends and I had to fo home from the hospital in a pair of scrubs because my clothes got ripped off.

Ever since then, I've lost my passion for makeup, which I was planning to make a career out of. I stopped dressing up, stopped wearing skin tight clothes, stopped wearing dresses or any other kind of girly clothes. I cut all my hair off and now I feel uncomfortable buying women's underwear. I have to buy men's underwear and order sports bras designed for trans people to help constrict my chest.

I have panic attacks when I go shopping, when I do makeup, and I have cancelled plans to go out with friends over the fact that I can't bring myself to get dressed up and I don't wanna show up in sweat pants again.

I dont really know what I'm looking for by posting here, maybe just to know I'm not alone? I hate that I lost such a big part of myself. I loved being girly and now I feel uncomfortable even wearing shirts with scoop necks.

It feels so stupid and trivial, I know, but I just kinda needed to put this somewhere out there.

Edit - wow thank you so much for the love and support. Your kind words have really helped lift me today.

I am in therapy but we are working through some childhood trauma through EMDR. My assault is something I struggle to speak about and this realization is the most I have ever opened up about how its affected me  to anyone.

I feel that this veneer will one day be torn away and I will be seen for the fact that there‚Äôs really not much to me.

"The book ""Body keeps the Score"" I am currently reading it and I am not even halfway through. Don't get me wrong, it is incredibly well written, both from a scientific and human stance, but it depicts PTSD in such a raw way that at times it can be quite triggering. From providing stories of survivors to describing symptoms of PTSD, I think it may have been the most accurate portrayal of PTSD I have ever read, especially from someone who claims to not have suffered from this disorder himself.

While I often do lament about people not understanding me or my PTSD, when I finally do find something like this that can describe me to a T, it gets overwhelming. I do still plan to finish this book, hopefully by the end of the year.

We have similar issues to deal with, maybe even the same triggers. I have been with ""normal"" women. Never again. They are belittling and cruel.

Topic title:
> [TW Sexual Abuse] Would you date/be interested in a girl that had been sexually abused as a young child?

Apparently he exclusively dates sexual abuse survivors because they can """"relate"""" to him. Only they also have to be half his age, because he fetishizes age gaps. Oh, and he prefers chubby women because they're ""more giving with themselves"", and ""more willing"". (Don't worry, we'll get to the lovely comments about that!)

Seems *legit.*

That whole suspiciously-enthusiastic, unprovoked, very r/SelfAwareWolves Not A Perv I Swear speech is because multiple people confronted him yesterday-ish about this. He's in full defense mode. Dude sure does like his ""my creepy sexual preferences are all because of PTSD, so I shouldn't have to worry about whether I'm hurting anyone else with them"" excuses.

Normal women are so bitter and cruel...lol. They call him creepy just for wanting to jack off to your sexual abuse, guys. :( This poor victim. There must be a conspiracy among all the woman who aren't half his age and so broken that he seems normal and safe for longer than 30 seconds. Yeah, that must be it.

He gets one creeped-out reply. As with every other comment from someone he creeps out, he immediately ghosts the conversation. Perhaps because he's had this conversation quite often *(for some mysterious reason)* and already knows how it's going to go, and he just doesn't care? 

But that's just my best guess at interpreting complete silence from someone who has had no counterargument to ""wtf this is predatory"" besides ""I have PTSD and I'm immature so I've decided it's okay. Anyways, why am I all alone? It's so sad how *""""""normal""""""* women can't stand me, even tho I'll never post a specific example because people sure do always agree with the womens' concerns whenever I do.""

> Be cool. You guys are smack in the middle of that amazing young, lusty, passionate, mind-blowing sex phase that makes life worth living. Just go with it and try not to over-think the situation. Instead of panic about how you might fuck it all up in the future, live in the moment. Appreciate the fact that this girl is super into you right now. Nothing lasts forever, especially not these white-hot hookups. That doesn't mean they aren't worthwhile. Have high hopes but keep expectations low. Also, form your own opinions of people. That shade about her being impulsive and emotionally unavailable has little to do with your current situation. That's the past. People can stop being impulsive and unavailable when they enter into a more appealing relationship. It's possible. So, take it as it comes. And if in the end it falls apart, at least you got to experience that passion. A lot of people are too boring and too careful to even allow themselves this pleasure. Let it do what it do.

> Skinny girls are okay to look at (sort of) because of the way clothing fits them. Fashionable Western clothing styles are usually fitted to be worn by lean women. I don't subscribe to these standards. I like thick women. It's disapointing when a great beauty has no ass on her. That beautiful, big ass on a chubby woman is only part of it, though.

> Skinny women are bony af. Ever lay with a skinny chick? She's all elbows and knee caps. Sometimes a woman is so petite I feel like I might break her on accident. A chubby woman is much softer, and to me, much more pleaseant to lay with. Simply put, they feel better to me. There's one more societal reason guys dig the chubby women of the world.

> They try harder. A thin woman who grew up skinny has never known the ridicule that fat women endure. A woman who's been told her whole life that she's ""hot"" will assume her mere physical presence is enough. I find skinny women are sometimes a bit full of themselves, especially if they're also blonde. Maybe it's just where I grew up, idk? A chubby woman who isn't accustomed to these platitudes and accolades isn't so full of herself. She's typically nicer, more generous with herself, and a more willing partner. It's the same for men, too. People who're told over and over they're the embodiment of some highly desirable feature mistakenly think it's all they need to bring when it comes to relations. Chubby women don't usually fall into that trap. Mad love for the chubs!

Hey look, ***he targets women who ""try harder"" and are ""more willing"" (because they have presumed low self-esteem).***

Oh sure, this poor little victim has noooo predatory motivations when he targets young sexually-abused women. He just wants someone who understaaaaaands him.

> I think you're really good at making excuses for why you cannot do things. Let's be honest here. Many guys are gonna be emtionally abusive regardless of your status as a survivor. What your comment says is you're still filled with lots of trepidation and feelings of unsafe vulnerability. Finding a match is an act of vulnerability. You might be excluding a lot of potentially good matches simply becuase you aren't ready to be vulnerable. It happens. We want recovery to occur quicker than it does and feel impatient we,'re not ""where we should be"". I get the deep lonliness. Remember I said I've had some success on reddit? I have been living in crazy, PTSD induced isolation, waiting 30+ years to find a woman like this. She's a survivor. She gets me. Talk to me in 2050 about your lonliness

Gee, I wondered where all the refugees from r/jailbait went! 

Dude just *loves* the obvious pedo-magnet community that inevitably only survives because they insist you lie and say you're 18. I'm not clicking in there, but let me guess: the vast majority of the population is old looking for young.

**He is literally targeting people** ***in this subreddit*** **and trying to convince them to heal from their sexual violence** ***by ""dating"" guys like him.*** 

And he refuses to even *acknowledge* the multiple power imbalances he clearly gets off on. 

Chubby women is his most legal kink. He doesn't say a single thing about their bodies that he likes, because he doesn't like them: he just looks down on them, and hopes they'll be too desperate and insecure to object to his glaring flaws.

Problem is, adult fat women often don't actually *want* to be with grimy assholes who expect them to abide by an unspoken rule of ""you're fat and worth less, so you should be grateful I even want to fuck you, and not have any standards for me to meet"". 

Just because *he* doesn't value them doesn't mean they're actually going to ""try harder"" - aka, ignore that he's a restraining order waiting to happen, that he likes em young, and that he talks about women like fuckable cattle. 

(And whatever else is horrible behind the scenes that can't be gleaned from literally just his public Reddit activity over the last day or so.)

Guess he's had more luck with sexually-abused teenagers.

Ban. 

Him.

I'm not going back farther in his post history. If this isn't enough, staff just doesn't give a fuck.

PTSD doesn't induce blameless *preferences* in grown adults for sex with insecure teens, insecure sexual abuse survivors, and insecure chubby women. That's not how this works. But it sure does get him misguided sympathy, and more access to sexually-abused teenagers than admitting the truth does.

I used to be a mod on a large mental health support community too. About 1k concurrent users at every hour of the clock. We banned pedos like this regularly. They crawled in to vent about their disorder, which sometimes existed and sometimes didn't, played the victim for a while, then told young girls over DM to take their clothes off.

"I did something different last night. Bad memories often come up when I try to go to sleep. Instead of crying by myself like I usually do, I took a risk. I went to my mom's room where she was already sleeping and crawled into her bed.

Why is this a risk? Well, in years past, she's not been very understanding when I cry or get bothered over past events. The most devastating memory I have of her is her yelling at me for crying so loud to bother the neighbors. This was a couple months after my dad / her husband passed away. She often asked why I was so depressed when she was the one who lost everything. After that, I lost trust in her to show her my feelings. I would just cry alone at night whenever the feelings became overwhelming.

Slowly over the past couple years since I've moved back home, I've been working things out with her and she's reflected and apologized for not understanding how to help me. It's improved a lot, but I still never asked her for support whenever I cry at night.

Tonight, after a decade, my mother hugged me the way I wanted her to while I sobbed my heart out. 

It took some coaching to get here, but she did it. It felt like my hole inside heart started to mend. After I got all the crying out, she said she wished she could have helped me more.

"Those of you with sexual trauma, do you struggle with experiencing sexual attraction? For a bit of context: I've experienced probable CSA along with repeated sexual trauma as an adult. I'm having a really hard time recently realising that it's so difficult for me to a) experience real sexual attraction at all, b) when I do experience it, experience it consistently, and c) decipher whether or not I'm attracted to someone.

For so much of my life I've found myself projecting my general feelings of sexual desire onto someone I wasn't actually attracted to, almost always someone who's expressed attraction to me - I think very often I misread the positive feelings of validation I get from knowing someone is into me as feelings of attraction on my part.

I'll think I'm attracted to someone until I actually do anything physical with them, and then I realise I'm just not feeling it at all. But even then I'll experience the physical sensations of arousal, which is always confusing and distressing for me - it feels like it's happening against my will and makes me second-guess myself and wonder if actually I *am* attracted to the person, even though there are alarm bells in my head telling me, 'no! This isn't good for you!'

There's been one person in my life - an ex - who I'm sure I experienced real attraction towards, but even then it was inconsistent. We had a romantic/sexual relationship, and sometimes I experienced attraction so strongly and it felt so good, right, instinctive and natural (though not necessarily without PTS symptoms during sex), and other times it was just like the attraction vanished (I found this tended to be when I felt less emotionally connected to my ex and/or when my mental health was poorer).

I suppose I just want to know if anyone here has similar struggles with sexual attraction? Does any of this sound familiar to you? And does anyone have any insight or any advice?

I'm struggling so much with this at the moment and am so fearful that I'll never be able to experience normal/healthy attraction, it would just help to get a little bit more of an understanding of my feelings.",ptsd

"I just learned I was sexually abused as a child. TW I'm in my early forties,. My sister is my age, and she just informed me that our brother, my own brother, sexually abused us as children. I mean, I already knew it, but it was buried so deep in my subconscious that it took this catalyst to remember. All of the memories came flooding back to me like deluge. I even remembered things that she didn't. 

I got diagnosed bipolar 2 a few years ago. My whole life has been a string of hypomania and depression. Mt father is a real life narcissist. I don't use that term ironically like a lot of people do these days. He's manipulative, mentally and physically abusive, and just all around broken. I decided around four years ago that it was time to stop trying to mend our relationship. I was constantly fighting his pull for me to satellite around him. 

So, I started going to therapy, finally. I'm learning a lot. I'm medicated and learning new coping mechanisms. I've really come a long way. 

But this is a huge revelation. My symptoms are so strikingly similar to PTSD, that I kept asking myself ""Where you sexually abused?"" 

The answer was always no. You would remember it of you really tried. Well that's not true.

I just learned this today. My sister and I cried together. My fianc√©, God bless her heart, is behind me 100%. 

Here's the fucked up part. My brother and I are close. This.changes everything. He has a son and a daughter, and from what I see, he's a really good dad. It really seems he has broken the cycle of abuse. 

I don't know how to move forward. Thank goodness I have therapy this Wednesday. Thank goodness my therapist has been focusing on PTSD anyway. 

Thanks for listening, guys. I'm just so gobsmacked that I don't know what to do. ",ptsd
"Why do people gatekeep trauma? I'm having a really hard time understanding the ""my trauma is bigger than your trauma"" thing.

"Is it wrong to expose the man who groomed me online 10 years ago? When I confronted him a year ago, he said he was just a dumb kid and that he was sorry (but then also said he didn't do anything that I was stating). He was 19-20 and I was 11. He was in college and I was in 6th grade. I'm not gonna do anything crazy like pressing charges because no media was exchanged. Nor would they even be able to pull up the messages. It was just a few months worth of text messages back in 2013. 

I thought he was a really close friend and that no one would understand, so that's why I kept it a secret. I really loved him. I know he did the same thing with other girls between 13 & 15 (back then, he told me he obtained photos of the 15yo). I'm autistic (diagnosed in adulthood), became very depressed at the age of 10, extremely insecure. Given that I hit puberty at age 8, I felt like I was mature enough for these types of conversations and situations. 

At the time, he would ask me about masturbation. When I talked about it, he would just say cute I was. He wanted me to describe my private areas. He asked me for photos at some point which I didn't do. Tell me he loved me. He told me he had a problem with young girls (when I got upset about the 15yo). He always speaks as if he is a kid; that cringe stuff ""so cute X3"". He also really wanted to drive and pick me up (drive from Texas to Florida) for a weekend. I was too anxious, he tried to assure me that he wouldn't touch me and that my parents wouldn't even know. I never went through with this. 

Do you think he really was just an immature kid? I feel like his problem would only worsen with time. As a 21yo myself, I can't imagine doing that stuff with anyone well under 18, let alone an 11yo. Should I cut him some slack?",ptsd

"anyone else have trouble working with yelling/angry people? Ive recently gotten a new job & ive been there 3 weeks & have already gone home crying four times. It's the little things that make them mad. Ive been yelled at for taking an extra minute to explain things to a customer, ive been yelled at for asking questions, ive been yelled at for not being able to hear what someone said. 

Everytime this happens I lose focus. My entire body is sent into a panic mode, like fight or flight & since I'm at work I can't do anything about it so I shut down. I can't truly smile or laugh, I can't focus well on my job, my performance decreases drastically & I can't socialize like normal, I'm all scattered. All I want is to hide and cry. & usually when this happens I can't even remember the majority of my shift the next day. So that's probably another reason it's taking me even longer to catch on. 

Am I alone in this? I'm thinking I might just have to find a new job already, or switch locations, but it just sucks that even after I try to explain that I have severe PTSD & can't work well when being yelled at, they still do it. & ive tried to bring it up to the GM but they kinda brush it off.

"Today I had mediaton with one of my abusers. We never had a relationship just FWB who ended up with a child,I did not see the red flags before I got pregnant. 

For 2 years he has been verbally abusing me, gaslighting me and treathening me.
We have had meetings on meetings than never helped.
And today was the day I feared the most,mediation. 

And I went through with it, I owned it.
I was scared shitless,I could not eat,my anxiety was at an all time high but I did it.
And im proud of myself, because for once I did not just sit there nodding my head saying yes to things I disagreed on.
No, I went in there full force looked him deep into his eyes and I said 

""I dont trust you,I dont respect you and I dislike you, but still im sitting here today trying to come to an agreement for our son.
It.felt.so.good.
It felt so damn good to finally being brave enough to tell him that. And when he gave me a letter from his lawyer where he treathened me that if I dont share custody he will take me to court.

I was even braver, again I looked him into his eyes and said no, he replied ""well ill take you to court"" and what I said its insane for me to even write ""Well then bring it on"". 

I am so proud of myself, I dont care that I have not been able to eat all day or that I feel like a truck has run over me. Im so damn tired I cant think straight, but none of that matters because I
I faced my abuser,I raised my voice,I stood my ground.

Long story short, i asked my friend for a microdose - and he gave me a huge dose of an incredibly strong strain of penis envy, not telling me until after i was losing my mind. I was hospitalized a week after being completely catatonic and not eating or moving from my bed.

It feels like no one understands, no matter how hard i try to explain to my friends and family. 
Why i wake up in intense panic and need to be alone for hours, why drinking makes me feel normal again, why i cant drink or eat things given to me unless i make it myself and many behavioural issues.
ive lost a lot of friends and relationships because im just not the person i used to be.
Its terrible being my age and everyone around me partying and smoking weed and doing psychedelics like i used to.

The worst thing about it is that i cant find any resources for my trauma and i cant find anyone else with it, i just want to find someone who understands.

I chose not to pursue anything legally & still have no desire to do so. But i‚Äôm thinking about sending his wife an anonymous letter - just to inform her. This is what I would say..

Hi, Your husband assaulted me when I was 15 in your child‚Äôs bedroom. Your husband uses Grindr & has sex with young men. You should get tested for STDs because he does not use condoms. 

I would also include a few personal details & info to prove that I‚Äôm legit.

"‚ÄúJust go buy new clothes, go to the gym, eat vegetables and everything will be better‚Äù Sorry for the rant but I was wondering what you guys think about this.

So basically, I have lots of unhealed trauma, starting from early childhood and the past three years with my abusive ex boyfriend destroyed me in more ways that I could imagine. 

He depleted my bank account, abused me sexually and destroyed my mental health.

What I see on here a lot is this type of advice that some people give: ‚Äújust get a glow up, girl, you‚Äôll look better and feel better‚Äù, ‚Äúinvest more in skincare and new clothes‚Äù, ‚Äúgo on dates‚Äù, Etc. 

I know that they only mean well with this type of advice. It‚Äôs meant to motivate, to feel better about oneself and so on. 

I am not saying that these things do not help with improving ones self esteem. But they are the wrong type of advice! As if I or many others HAD something to improve. As if our emotional turmoil resulting from abuse would be solved by spending 200$ at Sephora. Or signing up for dumb Yoga classes.

I was buying nice clothes and hitting the gym three times a week before I met him and also during the relationship. It didn‚Äôt change anything.

I think it‚Äôs somehow shallow to tell this people who recover from those type of relationships or any trauma because it gives them the impression that improving ones looks will improve ones self confidence.

"TW SA: I NEVER WANT TO HEAR THAT SA ACCUSATIONS RUINS A MAN'S LIFE Never in my life since experiencing all this did I ever think this would be a response from a person when I told them their employee assaulted me. I always thought I would hear ""Well there is no forensic evidence"", ""you're lying"" or ""you should have done xyz"". But what I read in that email broke my heart to pieces that none of those statements could have ever. For some context, I sent an email to his current employer to warn them of his past behavior that got him fired from a job before. In this job, he works with young women who are just barely adults and are so susceptible to abuse because their naive and just learning how to set boundaries and handle their alcohol, just like when I was raped by him. I was 18 and he was seven years older. Not saying that's what makes it rape, what made it rape was when I said no over and over and pushing him away throughout the assault, but it does show a power dynamic that gave him the ability to manipulate me into a position where we were alone and I had no way to escape. Anyway, this is what the email said. 

""Thank you for taking the time to write this email, and for the bravery to send it. I imagine it is not easy to remember or recount these things, and appreciate you sharing for the benefit of others.¬†

(His name) proactively disclosed this information to us when he began working for us, as well as its impacts on his work with (name of company). We keep it in consideration when thinking about his guiding work. It has felt important to us that (his name) has owned his mistake, and been transparent about his reflection and change. It also feels important to know, as you say, so that we would be attuned to anything that might suggest this is a pattern.¬†

I really appreciate you coming forward, and wish you all the best in your journey."" 

I have some seriously mixed feelings. I'm relieved to hear that he admits these things happen because now I don't have to constantly question whether I was crazy and making it up in my head. 

On the other hand, they let him off pretty much scot-free because he seemed remorseful. He has never reached out to me to tell me he was sorry or pay reparations (because fuck yeah I'm demanding money after he fucked my life up into pieces) It just makes me sick. I don't want a single man to ever tell me again that rape accusations ruin a man's life. My rapist told a future employer, showed remorse (without it involving the actual victim), was given a pass for a ""mistake"" and was given a job at a prestigious guide company. Never want to fucking hear rape accusations ruin a man's life EVER AGAIN.

Oh and also they talk about being ""attuned to a pattern"". Something has to happen twice for it to be a ""pattern"". They care more about this man's guide career than the wellbeing and safety of any woman he comes into contact with.

I right now just really need someone to explain how this could ever be ok. Maybe you've experienced the same thing. How do I ever have faith in our world or society again? How do I live with this?

"I feel like I'm 'not traumatized enough' to have PTSD Growing up, I was raised Christian. I was a queer, paranoid, neurodivergent kid, so the fear of going to hell constantly followed me around. I had many sleepless nights were I was simply terrified that if I didn't constantly apologize to God for doubting if he was real and being apart of the LGBTQ+ community, I would burn in hell. I don't think there was a single church service where I didn't burst into tears because of the guilt I felt.

When I was 13-14, I was sexually assaulted by a 16-17 year old friend of mine. She emotionally manipulated me into thinking she was the only honest one around me, and that I could only trust her. She touched me on my thighs, kissed me, held my waist, grabbed my face, used all of the physical touch she could to reassure me that she was the truthful one. And while I was uncomfy with it, she just laughed off my worries and said that ""it was fine."" I think she might've done something even worse because of the nightmares I keep having, but I don't want to blame anyone for something they didn't do. Nonetheless, I have barely cracked the surface of what I do remember, and I don't feel comfortable sharing all of it.

These two traumatic things have lead to me having nightmares, dissossciating when I get touched, hear certain songs, having full on panic attacks when people try to hug me or hold my hand, not being able to focus sometimes cause my thoughts are so full, and even attempting suicide because of how painful it all is. When I talked about it with my therapist today, she said that I almost definitely have PTSD.

However, while some of me is relieved that I actually have a name to put on what I'm going through, the rest of me feels as though I don't have enough trauma to have PTSD. I wasn't raped (at least, not that I can remember), and while I was sexually assaulted, I can't seem to tell myself that sexual assault is enough to be a cause by itself.

"Hairdresser grabbed my face and kissed very close to my lips after haircut. Feeling triggered. I've been getting my haircut by a 50+ y.o. Romanian man for over a year now. He's been nothing but professional that entire time. 

When COVID hit, he started to take some clients at his home and he would charge a little less than he would in the salon. 

This was my 3rd time going to his house for a haircut. The other 2 times, everything was normal. Again, professional. Sometimes we would discuss our love lives very briefly. I knew he was dating someone recently and I was happy for him. 

At today's appointment, I wasn't very chatty. I was really tired and just enjoying the feeling of someone touching my hair. When I first arrived and he was about to shampoo my hair, he asked if I had any Valentine's plans tomorrow. I said no, I'm single this year. 

We moved on to the haircut. I noticed he had a glass of wine on his counter. He told me has hadn't eaten today and he's a little tipsy. Ha-ha. I didn't think anything of it.

He asked me if I'm straight... I'm like...""yes?"" He continued the haircut. He asked me, ""Are you on any dating sites?"" I told him I was taking a break from dating, focusing on my new job, etc. 

So, at the end of the haircut, I paid him in cash. I thanked him. And...He grabbed my face with both hands...and kissed me many times on my cheek. Like, on my smile line. Which is really close to my lips. I really thought he'd end up kissing my lips. 

I just froze up. And then he walked me out and told me to drive safe.

I came home. Called my friends and family. Took Vistaril. I'm doing okay now. But I can't stop thinking about it.

And my whole day, and often even the next one or two are ruined as before.

TW just mentions/implacations of CSA

Soooo basically.

When i was 10 i experienced CSA.

Shortly after for that whole year i was constantly sick i.e. stomachaches/headaches and in and off school a lot. I also had a 'virus' for months where i was coughing and would get sick but no cause was found. So like did this CSA happen for longer than i thought? I dunnno.

Now i was explaining this to my friend last night and she was like. Was none of this investigated? I was like er not that i remember  ? She was not happy either way that my mum didn't notice anything from these symptoms. 

Now that i remember the CSA as an adult i could see how all this would be connected and it just blows my mind. Now i know that the other girl that was involved her mum was complicit but was my mum aswell? or was she just naive because shes not emotionally immature? 

Like i have so many questions that i know people can't answer.",ptsd

to help a trans person

that was attacked for being lgbt

the t in lgbt stands for transgender

a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender support center declined to support me because my problem, being attacked for being transgender, is too gross and annoying

everybody in my life is sick of hearing about it. everyone blames me and criticises me for my fight-or flight auto kicking in to fight. everyone gets hung up on that one detail, that I reacted with rage to being assaulted and chased my attackers away. literally nobody I have tried to talk to has been able to resist shutting down the entire conversation to belittle me for my anger. I have gotten almost zero fucking support from anyone in my life. I think my fiance maybe is in my corner but I'm so fucked up from this experience that I cant even consistently get myself to trust that.

thats why I wanted a therapist.

"30 minutes of screaming [TW: Sexual assault mention, me being very mentally ill]

I've been told that there's a point in EMDR treatment where your body just purges a bunch of the trauma all at once... and I think that finally happened this week. Recently I finally started to feel safe processing my rape directly, rather than focusing on tangential memories,  so I've been starting to go there. After my session on the 23rd, I started feeling really off. I got really intense and irritable. That feeling grew inside me throughout the week, and was becoming unbearable by the time of my next session on the 30th. After that, I started to feel anxious, like there was a frog in my throat. I tried going to bed early that night, but just couldn't sleep. At around 3 am, I lost control of my body and started twitching and screaming. I'm normally used to this sort of thing, since I've been having similar panic episodes for the last 2 years, but this was more violent. I could only stop screaming to inhale then continue screaming. When my roommate found me I couldn't even acknowledge her, cause the screams were spilling out of me like vomit. I was able to come down briefly with meds, but then I just started screaming again. It felt like forever, but afterwards, I feel... lighter? Like the trauma monster inside me has gotten a little weaker. I was really shook, though. I needed to sleep 11 hours and lay down all day yesterday to feel OK today. I don't wanna jinx it, but does this mean I get to live my life now?",ptsd

"Traumatic birthing experience Okay. So I have no idea where to start with this. I guess I should start with my pregnancy. I got pregnant last year, and me and my husband were ecstatic. But I had a very difficult pregnancy. I had pelvic pain that started around 8 weeks pregnant and continued up until I got induced. I got diagnosed with gestational diabetes, had to change my entire diet and then I was put on 9 units of insulin a day. And because of that, at 32 weeks pregnant, I had to go to the doctor and me and my daughter had to be monitored once a week. Then when I hit 36 weeks, I had to go 2x a week. And then I was induced at 39 weeks pregnant. When they were monitoring my blood pressure the day of my induction, they saw that it was high. They thought maybe it was nerves or something. So they tested my urine for protein, and it turns out I also had preeclampsia. And because of this, I had to be out on magnesium, which made my entire body hot and uncomfortable. I was already hooked up to so many things in my IV, the list just kept growing. They started the induction by using a foley balloon, wasn‚Äôt comfortable, but it was fine. Then when it fell out, I was dilated to 4 cm. Then they gave me a pill called cytotec to soften my cervix. Still wasn‚Äôt dilating much. Then they started me on pitocin. They told me that the magnesium and the pitocin would work against each other, and we were in for a long ride. I got some IV pain meds at some point. I still wasn‚Äôt dilating, and it had been about 12 hours in. I‚Äôm only at a 6. Doctor came in, and they had to turn my daughters head in my uterus by hand because she was facing up and she needed to be facing down. This was super painful. (I can‚Äôt remember if I had gotten an epidural yet or not) but they think they got it. And then I started dilating more and more over the course of what seemed like forever. It was over 48 hours from the start that they told me that I was at a 9. And my epidural would move to one side when I laid on my right side. So I would feel all of my contractions on my left side. And then when I laid on my left side, it fixed itself. So eventually, I started pushing at the 56 hour mark. My epidural wore off and I could feel almost everything. I pushed her out for the next 2 hours. I had to get a tiny episiotomy. And when she came out, everyone sighed a sigh of relief because it was over. But little did we know, it wasn‚Äôt over. They laid her on my chest, and the doctors were trying to get the placenta out. They took my daughter to the warmer, and my husband followed. They started to massage my uterus, but it hurt. Really really bad. It hurt worse than pushing my baby out. I asked the doctor ‚ÄúWhy are you doing it that hard?!‚Äù 
She looked at me and said ‚ÄúTrust me, you want me to be doing this.‚Äù
 My mom is standing next to me looking worried as hell, which doesn‚Äôt help the fact that I‚Äôm freaking out. I then hear one of the doctors tell the other one something about me needing blood. I start freaking out, so I try to call my husband over, but I‚Äôm to weak and he can‚Äôt hear me. My father in law gets his attention, and he comes over to me. I tell him that I need blood, and he‚Äôs freaking out. 

All of a sudden, I start to get really really sleepy. I ask my husband if I can go to sleep, the nurse said yes, and my mom said no. I tried to stay awake, my husband was trying to ask me questions to keep me awake. But I passed out. Well more like blacked out because my husband says my eyes were still open. He told me I threw up multiple times (I only remember 1 time). He told me that when he would try to talk to me, I would just stare at him with this blank look on my face and in my eyes. Like I wasn‚Äôt really there. There are a few things that I remember during my black out. I remember trying to answer people when they would talk to me. It felt like I was screaming, but nothing was coming out of my mouth. I remember seeing this new person in the room that wasn‚Äôt there before. Turns out he was like the head doctor or some shit. Then I saw that doctor doing an ultrasound because they put a balloon in my uterus to stop the bleeding and then I went back under. And then I started to come to when they hooked up the blood bag to my IV. I can‚Äôt remember when, but I‚Äôm pretty sure they gave me another epidural after I gave birth. They usually take out the catheter, but they left mine in. I remember being in the most immense amount of pain I‚Äôve ever been in. My mom had to help me shower because I could barely move. 

I know there are a lot of things that I‚Äôm leaving out, but I can‚Äôt really remember all of it. 

But because of all this, I feel so messed up. Every time I watch a show or a movie where someone is giving birth, I cry. Every single time. And it freaks me out because I can talk about what happened to me, and not cry or have flashbacks (most of the time). But when I see a labor and delivery room on TV, I get scared and I cry. My friend gave birth 2 months after me, and I was gonna go visit her, but I got scared of going back to the hospital. Every time I have my period, the blood scares me and I think something is wrong with me again. I was afraid to go home after being in the hospital because I thought I was gonna die. I‚Äôm scared to get pregnant again. 

I feel like I can‚Äôt talk about this with anyone because they‚Äôll get annoyed and think I only want to talk about myself. I‚Äôm going to therapy, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs working yet. 

I also just lost almost all of my friends because I just had a very bad anxiety episode, and I actually let people see what I was going through. And they all bailed. So I‚Äôm afraid to open up to anyone. My husband is deployed now. So it‚Äôs just me and my daughter most of the time.

"I found my dead uncle. I was laying in bed a few years ago just casually playing div rivals when my mum came running in.

She already knew what was waiting for me in that house and she let me run right past her into the thick of it. So yeh back to the time line, I dashed some bottoms on and ran across the road.

It got to the point where I was chewing through the dog lead to try and get him down. The next thing I remember is the 2 policeman and 1 woman coming in and dragging me off him. I no longer speak to anyone from that side of the family, mainly my grandmother as she knew what she was setting me up to see.

Sure she sometimes said things that I thought ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs awfully bold to say..‚Äù but then I‚Äôd make some excuse as to why it was okay for her to say those things or even to treat me the way she did. Everything seemed normal and fine. Until it wasn‚Äôt.. she ended up doing something that completely betrayed my trust in her, she stabbed me in the back. Everyone else tried to warn me and they were right. ‚ÄúShe sounds very narcissistic‚Äù my therapist said. But I grew up with that, so I didn‚Äôt see it as a bad thing because it was familiar. So if you ever find yourself in a similar situation where everyone around you is warning you about someone in your life, hear them out. They may see something that you thought was normal but isn‚Äôt.",ptsd
"Does anyone else ever feel their PTSD gets in the way of trying to have a relationship? I was raped by a female family member when I was 5 and she was 12. I have only recently regained all these repressed memories  and had a near complete breakdown. It has caused me trust issues that run so deep, the moment I meet someone I‚Äôm on guard and expect them to try and hurt me. I feel broken, like I‚Äôm too broken to ever have any kind of healthy relationship with another person let alone a partner. I feel like my PTSD is so exhausting to me that I‚Äôd never want to push it on another person and I can‚Äôt think of many reasons why someone would take the time to understand and listen. It‚Äôs too much and it hurts. I feel like any chance at normalcy in my life has been destroyed and I have no idea how to rebuild. It feels very lonely

Edit: Thank you all for your stories and advice. I just wanted to clear that I am in and have been in therapy for a while and it has been beneficial. I know I have a lot of trust issues to work out and hearing and reading everyone sharing and helping one another is the best thing I could‚Äôve asked for.",ptsd
"Anyone else not able to work Anymore? PTSD/Anxiety Disorder I've been struggling with this almost 4 years now and finally applied for social security a week ago. I got fired from my last three jobs for attendance. I haven't worked in a year and struggle to even make a trip through Walmart. I don't even enjoy my only hobby anymore (Gaming) because anxiety always ruins it. It exhausts me even to the point that I have thrown up trying to force my self to keep playing and ignore it. Aside from that my anxiety is constant, usually worse at night and panic attacks are pretty much every other day. I'm not a war hero and my illness is from several traumatic events but I feel like my symptoms aren't normal for just PTSD. My question is does anyone else suffer this illness to the point they can't even go anywhere anymore?

And because I am  functioning ‚Äúwell‚Äù, I don‚Äôt know if PTSD is what I have. I don‚Äôt sleep well, have vivid or recurring nightmares/flashbacks. I feel a lot of fear and anxiety.

"Does anyone get triggered by things that have nothing to do with your trauma? (TW) I was diagnosed with PTSD 13 years ago. Since then I have figured out all of my triggers and have done my best to work through them. However, I have one trigger that is super random and has nothing to do with what caused my trauma! 

Here is some background-

When I was 5 I was sexually assaulted

When I was 10 I witnessed my dad try and murder my mom. He was on some sort of drugged and just flipped out on her. I'm not going to go into detail because it still makes me shake but it was horrifying.

When I was 14 I was raped.

All of my triggers from these are triggers you could imagine. I have one trigger though that is super random?! Whenever I am in a car and it starts to storm or if i am in a car with a driver who drives somewhat fast I immediately get triggered and break down into an episode. I have no idea why this happens? This trigger is bigger than all of my other ones too? 

Does anyone else ever go through something like this? I'm just always so confused over it.",ptsd

‚ÄúYour accomplishments and talents are still yours, even if you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre that person anymore üíñ‚Äù

"Mother trying to move on after finding out 12 year out daughter was raped Edit: WARNING. This horror has become so apart of my life now that I‚Äôm use to it. And I forget that it really fucks people up just hearing about it it‚Äôs so traumatic. So just to prepare it‚Äôs about aggravated sexual assault with young children.


Ok so I found out this summer that my daughter who is 12 now was raped when she was 7 multiple times by my best friends husband. She told me that it finally stopped when she went to her best friend, (my best friends daughter) and asked her to tell her dad to stop. And then it didn‚Äôt happen again after that. I called my best friend and told her what I just found out. She was shocked and had doubts but said she would ask her daughter if she remembers that. She called me back an hour later crying cuz her daughter admitted and admitted he‚Äôs been raping her too starting when she was 5. His own daughter. she kicked her husband out and we called the police and I‚Äôm very happy to say after a week of working with the fbi. my friend got him to confess to it all while the fbi was listening. He‚Äôs now in jail waiting trial. Finding this all out has devastated our whole family. My husband had to come home early from his deployment we were so devastated. Months have gone by. I signed My daughter up for trauma counseling and they said after two sessions she doesn‚Äôt need trauma counseling. That she has moved on from this and is not traumatized by it. I asked my daughter if that was true and she said yes she just wants to move on and be a normal family again. I tell her ok and say help is there for you if you need it. I know this is what she wants and she doesn‚Äôt want this to be our life. but I‚Äôm having a hard time moving on and I don‚Äôt want to upset her. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. How the fuck did I not see this.. how did my friend. not see this. Our family have been so close for the last ten years. We get together 3 times a week for ten years. He was so fucking normal. How did I not see this monster who raped his 3 biological daughters now we know, and my daughter was next to me this whole time. We are both stay at home moms. Our kids are our everything. And these kids were always happy. We never once saw them in pain or saw bloody underwear or saw her crying around him. And they had to have been and I can‚Äôt move on from my confusion. How was this massive absolute horror happening for years and no one had a clue. And the guilt. My job is to protect her and I failed. No matter what I do for the rest of her life I have failed as her mother. I don‚Äôt know how to not have this be my life. I‚Äôm never gonna not be devastated or confused or fulled with so much guilt. Everyone says I need therapy but I don‚Äôt see the point. On the outside I‚Äôm normal. I‚Äôm ok I‚Äôm not crying on the couch for days. I‚Äôm playing with my kids and my husband and I are great. We really leaned on each other. He agrees with my daughter and wants to move on. I feel like my family is moving forward and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Lucky I have my best friend still. And she is the only one who understand what I‚Äôm going through. But it‚Äôs not the same. She understands that for about two years of my life all my photos are ruined. Every photo from the time she was 6-8 all I think about is was this when she was raped? Is she in pain in this photo and she pretending? My friend understands this because all the photos for the last 18 years are ruined for her. And she feels all this guilt and more. I can‚Äôt imagine what she is going though. She lost her husband who she thought they ‚Äúwe‚Äôre happy‚Äù but realizes it was all a lie. She lost her dream house(that she closed on three days before we found out)She lost 2/3 of her income. And she has the guilt of this happening to her three daughters. She knows what I‚Äôm going through more then anyone. But what I‚Äôm going through doesn‚Äôt even compare to what she‚Äôs going though. I don‚Äôt want to complain to her about my family going back to normal and happy and I‚Äôm just frozen with my thoughts. 

Ok so not I explained what I‚Äôm going though I was wondering if anyone has gone through something similar. And I‚Äôm wondering if me frozen with my horror in my head is just my normal and I need to except it.",ptsd

"I blocked someone who causes me triggers and I feel better. Man. I told this person to leave me alone. Why?

She was a callous idiot after my accident. She broke my heart, and made me feel  so miserable just 2 days after my accident.  I cried even more because of that and i really wanted to die in that moment. 

After that, i was an idiot. I tried to forget that and give her another chance. 

Let's just say that she took advantage of my affected mental state and made me into a person who did what she wanted for a little comfort from her. But anyway. Half year later, i realized what she was doing to me, and how she even physically hurt me. So, i left her. And I made it clear to her to leave me alone. Thanks to the quarantine, now i could be away in all ways from her. 

Almost. Tonight she started following me on Instagram. I had a little trigger about the accident when i sawed the notification. I wasn't in panic, but it felt bad. So i decided to block her. I don¬¥t know. First i tough that i was been immature. But, now that i'm writing this, i just feel better. Like, in peace. I don't know...

  
I just wanted to vent myself writing this. I think it was the best decision. That person just makes me anxious and makes me fall into flashbacks. There is nothing good in that person. Did I make a good decision? I hope so...",ptsd
"I hate hearing ""you just need time"" I'm sure a lot of you can relate. It's all I can do to give this trauma time. I'm aware it will ebb and flow in the future.

I was ordered my the court to receive mental health treatment. I bounced around from therapist to therapist until I found one who cared about me. I opened up and can say that I have begun healing. I spent 20+ years in turmoil never realizing that PTSD was affecting me in so many ways. It always will affect me but now I have the power to understand it and work through it.

"Today I stand up to my CEO Update: Thank you SO MUCH for the insight, kindness, and support. I read a lot of encouraging comments right before I went in and again after I came out. I practiced what i was going to say over and over again that morning.  I didn't cry or lose my place and I stuck to facts only. One person in upper management in particular really had my back. After the meeting I cried a bunch and then went up and down several flights of stairs over and over until I was ready to go back to work.  I really do appreciate all of the kind words. I'll keep reading them to get myself through the next few weeks as well.

Original:


About 6 weeks ago my boss made a joke about sexual abuse of children. I didn't feel like I could do anything about it because he is the CEO. Shortly after that he made a joke about women in the workplace speaking up about sexual harassment. 

I wound up in partial hospitalization and diagnosed with PTSD related to several traumas including sexual assault I experienced as a child.

I asked for a meeting with all of upper management so that I can start back up at work with clear boundaries for what I won't accept anymore.

This will be a good thing in the end, but right now I feel like I'm going to throw up. Meeting is in 3 hours. Send good vibes please?",ptsd

The last couple of years he became extremely close to this friend, he found a new lifestyle within him. He‚Äôs noticeably healthier thanks to their time spent together. My boyfriend always spoke highly of his friends mind, body and spirit. From the very beginning his friend was someone special to the point where he would introduce him as his angel to other friends. They spent countless hours together training on the road. They spent at least three sometimes four days out of the week training together. They have different routes to train on but last Thursday morning they decided to go train on the ‚Äúsafest route‚Äù to just loosen their legs a bit. It‚Äôs the same route they‚Äôve ridden on hundreds of times. A route where generations before them would train on. Even a route where my boyfriend would take me to ride on. It was like any other day. My boyfriend left the house around 7am to meet up with his group and they were on the road by 7:30. My boyfriend and two other friends escaped the peloton and were a few minutes ahead so my boyfriend decided to send a text to the rest of the group to let them know they slowed their rhythm to wait for them. As he was texting he got left a few meters behind and within that split second a car going more than double the speed limit estimated 200 km per hour veered past the white line of the highway and struck his friend. My boyfriend just heard an explosion looked up and saw his friend in the air and saw how he fell to the ground. His other friend was right next to him when it happened. They were in shock to say the least. He says he saw his friends soul leave his body in an unexplainable way he just saw a part of him leave. The car did not stop. The driver left with the bike incrusted in the car. I can‚Äôt even imagine the helplessness they felt in that very moment. Please respect cyclists. They‚Äôre practicing their passion. Keep your distance and respect their space. The pain in our hearts could have been completely avoided. It was a senseless murder. My heart aches for his family, friends, and my boyfriend. I wish I can take his pain and the image out of his head. Everything is very recent we can only take it a day at a time. Everything was taken within a split second. I‚Äôve mentioned seeking therapy for this traumatic experience but he‚Äôs not interested and insists in just living through the process on his own. He says it‚Äôs something that will never leave his mind. All I can do is be there for him and listen when he wants to talk.

"Cannabis use & PTSD Discussion: What strains help your pstd symptoms and what strains do you avoid? Hey folks!  There's lots of cannabis strains and I'm curious to know what some favourites are for curbing your ptsd symptoms.  There are some out there that could trigger symptoms and some that are fantastic.

I know for myself:

* Jack Herer helps clear my thoughts, great for daytime
* Strains with limonene also great for a clearer headspace for me
* any sort of Girl Scout Cookies variety makes me anxious and shaky/trembling, not a fan
* Romulan or a similar heavy hitter gets me to sleep on the toughest nights

"My abusive ex called me after 3,5 years of no contact and it triggered my ptsd So my (23f) ex (22m) and I were in a relationship when I was 18. We were together for a year before I broke up with him because he was so abusive.
He used to hit me, gave me a black eye, choked me, told me I deserved all of it, isolated me and made me lose all of my friends and even had me write down rules he had for me.

He was my first bf and it broke me. A month after I broke up with him I met my current bf and we have been together for 3,5 years now, he is amazing. Has always been very patient with me and convinced me to get therapy. I was in therapy for ptsd for a year and it helped a lot. I'm still not where I want to be but I'm ALOT better.

Last night at 10.30 pm I was watching a tv show with my bf and an unknown number called me. I did recognize it from somewhere but I couldn't remember from where. My bf decided to call the number with his phone because he knows I hate being called by random people. A guy picked up and they had a short conversation where my bf asked him why he called me and who he was. The guy just said it didn't matter and hung up.

I recognized his voice immediatly and I had trouble breathing. My bf asked me if I was okay and if I wanted to call him myself. I did and when he picked up he said he called me by accident which I dont believe. I could only get an ""okay"" out of my mouth before he said goodbye and hung up. But I am still freaked out about it.

My boyfriend was really sweet after it happened and kept hugging me and telling me that I'm in good hands now. I just can't get it out of my head. I also had trouble sleeping.

I'm sorry this is so long, I don't even really know why I'm posting this but I just had to share it with someone. Any advice is welcome",ptsd
Learned something new from OBGYN Backstory: had an ovarian cyst rupture the other day. I had to go for a pelvic exam to make sure it was draining properly and that there were not more cysts. Being that I just turned 21 I had not gotten an exam before. That being said when she was doing the exam she had hinted at the fact that I had pelvic floor problems. My muscles were too tight and as a result I had problems trying to hold a kegel. When I asked her if there was something I could do to train my body and why it happens she told me that it‚Äôs normal for women who have had sexual abuse. Sexual abuse is so common and I am so mad that we are not taught about the physical effects that stick with us! I‚Äôve been in therapy for a while to address my complex PTSD yet no one has ever actually talked to me about the fact that pelvic floor disorders are common for sexual assault victims (with vaginas).,ptsd

"Birth sent me mentally back ten years NSFW I just gave birth two weeks ago. Me and my husband prepped A LOT beforehand. We had several appointments at the hospital kind of planning how to make this birth as comfortable for me as possible. I read like 7 books about giving birth, went to two birthing courses (one where we paid extra so it was just me and my husband there) and read up on C-sections just in case a natural birth wouldn't work out. The hospital staff were amazing, respectful and kind. Everytime a man had to come in to the delivery room he introduced himself first and I felt comfortable.

I had to be induced and went through four days of really painful contractions and I nailed it! I was calm and felt so powerful. Then her heart rate dropped significantly and the safe birthing suite were swapped out with an operation room and tons of doctors, noise, bright lights and basicly all the things that make me terrified. I had a panic attack apparently, but I can't really remember it that well. My daughter made it(thank God). 

Things have been... Bad afterwards to say the least.. 

When I met my husband ten years ago I was a wreck. I was terrified of men, couldn't trust anybody and I felt unsafe constantly.
After years of therapy and self work I was in a really good place. I went off my meds about a year and a half ago (with help from my doctor) and I felt safe and confident. 

Now I don't anymore. I'm not just terrified for myself, but also for my daughter. I can't deal with men being near her or me. That includes my husband. I don't sleep, because I have to protect myself and her. When I basicly collapse from exhaustion I have nightmares about what caused me to get ptsd so many years ago and again I wake up terrified.

My husband is trying his best to take care of me and he backs off when he sees how terrified I am. This should be a happy time, but instead I just feel to lost and empty.

"Male sexual assault survivor and I just got diagnosed with PTSD. Still don't feel like my case is bad enough. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD stemming from a sexual assault that occurred last year. I have had nightmares, flashbacks, being overly cautious, etc. 

I still don't feel like my case is nearly as bad as others, as my sexual assault only lasted about 15 seconds, and was from an intimate partner. I am also a man, and it was done to me by a woman. It was very painful and I still can feel the pain vividly in my mind. It was a horrible experience.

I feel like my body wasn't only raped, but so was my mind. It's a hellish existence I'm living. But I don't feel like my case is nearly as bad as some others I've heard. I never thought I would be sexually assaulted because I was never taught that this can happen to men, and I'm very ashamed for feeling the way I do.

"I told my mom that I got raped  I've always had a really complicated relationship with my mom. We were never emotionally close and she never provided me emotional support when I needed it.

She comforted me for what felt like the first time in my life. And I just started crying, I cried so much. She said ""I'm sorry I didn't protect you enough"" and that hit me so hard. 

I'm not really an emotional guy, but that night I let everything out. I wasn't shamed or ridiculed, I was actually comforted. 

Sorry if this is a weird post. I might delete this later. I just needed to let it out",ptsd
"Does anyone else feel like their excuse for having PTSD isn't 'bad enough?'' I was in a toxic relationship. Yes, I did feel emotionally abused by them, but it was an online relationship. It has been 2-3 months since I broke up with them and I just feel like I am a crybaby and should get over it already because they probably have forgotten me. Since also I grieved over a fictional character (as stupid as it sounds.) I still avoid things that remind me of their death.

The relationship I had gave me a derealization disorder, (dissociation) which is caused by stress. Does this mean I need help? or should I get over it? I really just want closure and comfort. I feel so hopeless all the time.",ptsd
"DAE feel like they're living a double-life with their trauma and daily life? I'm not sure if the title makes sense but I feel so out of place to normal life a lot. I feel like the life I should be living is one thing which I outwardly act like I do.

But then I also constantly carry all these memories of traumatic things that affect me a lot. It's like a whole different world I feel like I'm in than my healthy, non-traumatized peers. It's constantly full of all these triggers and emotions and memories and just so much, always something affecting me or something going on, but it's kept so hidden to those around me. I've had people joke about getting PTSD from a test we had right in front of me and I feel so distanced and out of place. They have no idea all the things that take up my mind all the time. And I'm aware I don't know about theirs, either, but I'm curious if this is a trauma (/traumatized individual trying to assimilate with normal society) thing maybe specifically, or not

I've felt this way growing up as well with abuse going on in my family and having to hide it outwardly, as well. I don't know if it's that I'm feeling isolated, maybe? I'm really not sure and brain fog is big today. I would love to hear other's opinions and experiences with this though",ptsd

"Sex is very hard for me. I feel like I don't have control over my body's responses to a lot of things and that I'm crushing my husband by not reacting appropriately to gentle advances He goes into work late today and I'm doing my morning browsing and he initiated touching because he was aroused and I got really panicked and froze up - being kissed lightly on the back and similar loving advances were just too much, the sensation did not feel good. Also sometimes an extended embrace feels like being trapped. He's really hurt I know although he understands and does NOT want me to feel bad. I feel guilty because I know it feels like rejection to him and he feels guilty for persisting and making me uncomfortable. I feel like utter shit and he does too, in addition to him feeling rejected.",ptsd
"Any girls after abuse revert into being cutesy/girly/young etc? Any females who experienced abuse revert back into being timid/girly/or young?

I‚Äôm 27 and feel like I‚Äôm acting like a teenage girl again with my style. 
Idk if it‚Äôs okay to embrace that since it‚Äôs comforting or if it‚Äôs something I should be careful with.

"Human Trafficking Is Absolutely Terrifying! The thing about intuition is that you can only sense it before it happens, but it doesn't tell you when or how it's going to happen, and it doesn't tell you how to protect yourself from the danger that gave you the feeling in the first place. I questioned what made this movie about human trafficking give me the feeling that something terrible was going to happen to me, yes, what happened in the movie can happen in real life, but I couldn't even imagine something like that happening to me, because I was fat. A year later, when I was in my twenties, I lost weight, and later, my life began to spiral, and that's when an older guy I met introduced me to cocaine. A few months later he said he is in love with me and asked how I felt about him, I told him he is a great guy, and a great friend, but I love him more like a brother, I apologized to him for not feeling the same, he said it‚Äôs okay, he understands, he‚Äôs cool with it and I don't have to be sorry. Nothing changed, we hung out twice and everything was okay and normal, on the third day I had such a terrible feeling but I didn't care because I needed cocaine to feel better, as I pulled into the parking lot to meet him, that feeling grew stronger so I asked him if he could come inside my car this time, but he said no because he had already taken it out of the bag and prepared it for me in his car. After I closed my window, I told myself to just relax, because today is no different from any other day, I didn't trust my words of reassurance, so I left my car doors unlocked and when I sat in his car I left the door open with my leg hanging out the door, he asked me to close the door, and I said I can‚Äôt because my car is unlocked, that I had to be able to attack whoever tried to steal it, he didn't ask me again, and that calmed me down. He waited until I was high off the cocaine to offer me the weed, I took a few hits and started choking, but he had a full bottle of water for me. As the drugs began to take effect, he started driving with my leg still hanging out the door, if I hadn't been so high, I would have thought to jump out of the car, but instead I shut the door. I have smoked weed before and I mixed it with cocaine, mixed drugs with other drugs and alcohol but none of them had an effect on me like this, something must have been in the water, I think I blacked out, when I opened my eyes we were on the highway, I asked where  are we were going, and then I fell asleep, I kept waking up and passing out. One of the times I woke up, I remember hearing him say that he sells woman and makes a lot of money, and then I fell back asleep, I slept the rest of the way, and when he woke me up, we were parked in someone's driveway. We walked into the house and there was a man standing there with a bottle of vodka, he ordered me to drink it, I said no, and then he and the guy who kidnapped me forced it down my throat. I remember the house, there was no furniture, and in the bedrooms there was a mattress in each room with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress did not have a bed frame or any furniture. As the two guys spoke in the kitchen, I had the worst feeling I ever had in my life, the l human trafficking movie had crossed my mind, I thought I was never going see my family again, as high and intoxicated as I was, I had to try to find a way out of that house, because I didn't want to find out what might happen to me. I walked into one of the bedrooms to see if I could open the window just in case I needed to quickly escape, the curtain was dark, and the window was boarded up, I remembered when my kidnapper told me he loved me so I asked him if I could speak to him in private, I said it was really important because I can't keep this secret any longer than I have, he walked up to me and asked what is it? I said I lied when I told him I love him like a brother because I was afraid if I was honest with him, it would hurt me if I ever lost him. He asked if I was serious, I said yes and I hugged him tightly, he was totally shocked, excited, and then he told me he will be right back because he had to call off a deal he had made with his friend, I was standing in the empty living room when I heard a glass bottle shatter and I was afraid the friend of the guy who kidnapped me had killed him. When my kidnapper walked into the living room, unharmed, I felt so relieved, the other guy was also unharmed, as we were heading towards the door, I turned my head to the kitchen and saw the bottle of vodka shattered in pieces on the floor, and the guy seemed really angry, because he was silent when I said goodbye to him. On the car ride back to the Walmart where my car was parked, he told me that the deal he made with the guy was not his friend, it was his client, and the deal he made was to sell me, that man was going to buy me, with real money, buy me when I am a human being, not an object. He informed me that the house I had been taken to was the first stop, and I was going to be transported to another house somewhere else, I asked him which location and he said his client couldn't tell him because he knows me personally, it's a security thing to prevent him from coming back to pick me up if he changed his mind after I had been sold. He said he just wanted to be honest with me because he didn't want the beginning of our relationship to begin with a secret hidden from me, especially when it is a secret that involves me, I knew I had to watch what I say because my behavior and my actions were closely monitored, and I was petrified to be taken back to that house. I said, I forgive you baby, because I understand that some people just have to do whatever it takes to make money to support their families, I know that your father had passed away and you are trying to take care of your mother, I said this doesn't change my love for you, nothing ever will change that, he smiled and kissed me, he believed me, he held my hand, and I made sure I didn't let go while I was awake, I felt like it was the right time to close my eyes and sleep because I was still high and intoxicated, so I told him I was going to take a nap, he said, go ahead baby, I love you, and I said I love you too baby. When he woke me up, we were parked next to my car, still feeling petrified that he would take me back to that man's house, as he closely observed my reaction when I looked at my car, I had to keep playing it cool until I was safe, I said in a funny way, wow, nobody stole my car when the doors are all unlocked, he laughed, and then we hugged and kissed each other goodbye, I sat inside my car, acting like I was doing something as I was waiting for him to drive away, and after he drove off, I broke down in tears and thought of all the girls in the world who are victims of human trafficking, all the girls who are being held captive, my heart breaks for them and my heart goes out to them all. I know that I have no right to say that I know how it feels to be a victim of human trafficking, but I felt the terror that comes with it, the fear that I will never see my family again, and the end of my life as I knew it before. This was by far the scariest and most traumatic day I had ever experienced in my life, please do not tell me that I am lucky to have escaped, or that this makes me a brave person because I am not. I feel disgusted with myself and I feel so incredibly guilty for what I said to him, I hate myself for feeling so petrified that I had gone so far as to pretend to be okay with the fact that he sells innocent woman to make money, I wish I said screw my life and stood up for all the victims of human trafficking, I am so sorry. How to identify a human trafficking house? There are high security devices, non-transparent windows, boarded up windows, bars on windows, barbed wire and surveillance cameras in the work or living areas.",ptsd
"I should have trigger warning stamped on my forehead - just a venting session, no actual triggers Does anyone else feel like they been through sooo much that trauma or common triggers appear normal except for the fact that most things people learn about you shock them?

For example, say someone asks me about my mom and I say ‚Äúoh she passed‚Äù. Asking about my mom didn‚Äôt bother me but watching your jaw drop did. 

The weirdest thing is that I often feel the compulsion to share my traumas when I‚Äôm doing poorly but I‚Äôm too afraid to over share people into shock. It‚Äôs like I try to tell on myself to people I just met that ‚Äúwarning I‚Äôm messed up. Traumatized enough to trigger a whole blocks radius. Potential friends have been warned‚Äù.

"How should I proceed with this? Therapist said she doesn‚Äôt think I have PTSD, even though I am professionally diagnosed. I was diagnosed with PTSD a few months ago by a licensed psychologist. I had to get a 2 hour psychological assessment in order for me to get disability accommodations at my university. It was a surprise, but made sense. I never bothered to look at the PTSD symptoms. I always thought I had extreme anxiety mixed with paranoia. 

I have been seeing my therapist for around 5 months now and to say she knows me is a lie. I have not even told her half of the stuff I‚Äôve been through. Part of that is because I think I‚Äôm repressing some trauma, but some of it is vague enough to be remembered. 

Anyways, I told her about it and she doubted it and made this confused face. She even said everyone has trauma and basically made me feel invalidated? She even looked up the symptoms on her phone to ‚Äúrediagnose me‚Äù. I really like her as an *eating disorder* therapist, she has helped me very much with my anorexia, but I dunno this made me feel very invalidated and shitty. 

What should I do about it? Does she have a right to doubt it?

"/r/ptsd suicide & serious self-harm policy Hey /r/ptsd community,

I hope you're doing at least okay and that you had a good new year, be it with friends, with family, if you're isolating or just having me time.  2020 has been a rough year for all of us, but I am hopeful that 2021 will be better.  Here's to all your successes, your survival, and if nothing else, to just getting by, because that's still something.

Since we have over the holidays again received a few posts regarding suicide, we (the /r/ptsd mods) have decided to institute a suicide policy, which will be added to the sidebar since there hasn‚Äôt been one stated anywhere previously and we think it‚Äôs time we posted one. Basically:

We recognize [Reddit‚Äôs Suicide Policy](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513931) and posts or comments advocating it will be removed. If you are seeking help you will be directed to /r/suicidewatch and [their resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines)--since we cannot know where somebody is located and cannot maintain an international directory. Suggesting others commit suicide will result in an immediate ban.

If you see any suicidal posts, please report them to us.  While the mods are spread across different timezones, we do have the ability to review every post that comes in.

In the spirit of mod transparency, if we see a user is posting something with suicidal or serious self-harm tendencies, we will take the following actions:

* we will inform reddit, using the report function. Which you are also welcome to do as well, in addition to reporting to us, so that we can react ASAP.

> Reddit has partnered with [Crisis Text Line](https://www.crisistextline.org/) to provide redditors who may be considering suicide or seriously hurting themselves with support from trained Crisis Counselors. If you‚Äôre worried about someone, you can let us know by reporting the specific post or comment that worried you and selecting, *Someone is considering suicide or serious self-harm*. After you let us know, we‚Äôll reach out (confidentially) to put them in touch with Crisis Text Line‚Äôs trained Crisis Counselors.

* the post will be removed, per the recommendation of the [National Suicide Prevention Alliance](https://www.nspa.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NSPA-Guidelines-Responding-to-Suicidal-Content-Online.pdf)

> ""Unsafe content can have a negative and potentially dangerous impact on others, and should be removed""

* And we will follow up with a public reply for OP, as well as anybody from the community who may come across said post:

> Hey /u/[OP], we‚Äôve seen your post and we‚Äôre worried about you. If you are considering suicide, please call a [hotline](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines) and/or visit /r/SuicideWatch. The best way of getting a timely response is through a hotline.

"I need to talk about last night I've been volenteering as a firefighter even in the mists of COVID-19 outbreak . I know it's dangerous but we got to protect our neighbors and loved ones. About a month ago I was in Nashville when the tornadoes happened and saw first hand of the damage. I was there for 2 weeks after school helping . 

Last night I was driving off the clock and was right infront of a roll over crash . Girl ran a red light and guy had the right away. He flipped 3 times and watching it was like out of a movie. I ran up with a tryna kit I keep in the car and he was stuck in the truck. I had to break through his windshield to get him out . 

After 2 minutes I got in and pulled him out . He had glass in his face and blood was Everywhere. Looking at him I realized I went to school with him and he was my teachers kid. I layed him down and looked for DNR signs (do not resuscitate) and he didn't have any so I proceeded to begin CPR. He woke up to tell me to call his dad and as I called the EMT came in to get him.  .

He did not make it. The lady was under the influence. I feel so ashamed when I was in the class and the teacher wasn't there . I cried in class and feel guilty that I couldn't save him . Hunter I'm so sorry buddy. 

I have flashbacks to that night and I haven't been able to work since that night until I'm cleared.

I want to start this out by saying that I am a transgender woman. I am legally male, and I have a penis. This is important to what I say in this post.

When I was 16, I was raped by a cisgender woman. Multiple times. She saw me as a man, and tried to convince me that I was one. She was my only friend at the time. I knew that what she was doing was abusive, but I did not stop her from assaulting and raping me for a few reasons:

1) I did not want to lose my only friend.

2) I felt that if I used my superior physical strength to push her off of me, I would be easily framed as an attacker, as someone who would be considered a man in court.

I hate that my attacker was female. Had she been male, I would have more people willing to support me. It is so tiring having to deal with people thinking that the damage done to me was less, both physically and mentally, than it would have been if my attacker had been a male. I‚Äôm tired of being told I am ‚Äújust lucky for getting sex‚Äù or other things along those lines. 

I have also been sexually assaulted over 40 times since by other cisgender women.

I hate that had I reported, people would care even less because in most places cis women aren‚Äôt even considered to be capable of rape.

I hate that I could even be framed for it. I was forced to penetrate. I hate dealing with the paranoia that if I say something she would turn it around on me calling me the rapist because I was the one penetrating. 

I often find myself wishing that she was a man, and I feel awful for that. I see and hear the difficulties that victims of men face. I don‚Äôt want to downplay their pain in any way, shape, or form. And yet..I remain jealous. So infuriatingly jealous. They have support groups, legal backing, so much more representation and acknowledgement.. 

I wish that I had somewhere I could relate to others. For me, going to a support group would mean going to a men‚Äôs support group, which misgenders me. Going to a women‚Äôs support group would mean being surrounded by people who are seen as potential rapists and predators by my PTSD, and who‚Äôs experiences I cannot relate to as someone who was forced to penetrate..

Then there is also the shame, transphobia, racism..everything else that would be in my way of finding help and support.

"I gave someone I love PTSD. Then found out I have CPTSD. I got divorced around 6 months ago.  My ex wife told me at the beginning that she had PTSD.  Specifically that I gave her PTSD.  

It really messed ME up because I really love her and never thought of myself as an ‚Äúabuser.‚Äù  

Since then, I have been sober 4 months.  Done 5 months of therapy and had several Psychiatrist appointments.  I found out that I have CPTSD.  Which I didn‚Äôt even know was a thing.  I didn‚Äôt know a lot about a lot of mental health conditions.

I‚Äôm sure this will not go over well‚Ä¶but I never thought of my behavior as abusive.  Because I compared it to the abusive behavior that I had experienced in my life.

This whole experience has taught me a lot about trauma.  Specifically that trauma is a very individual experience.  There‚Äôs no ‚Äúbetter‚Äù or ‚Äúworse‚Äù it‚Äôs all in the eye of the beholder.

&#x200B;

First, sometime before 5 I was repeatedly sexually abused/assaulted. I don't know what actually happened, I don't remember any of it. I just know that by the time I was 5 I had knowledge of what porn is and what sex toys are/how to use them, and I have memories of me asking my friends if they knew what grown men looked like naked. The only reason I know anything happened for sure is due to another situation I'll explain later on.

&#x200B;

When I was 6, my friend started doing things to me like looking up my skirt and trying to stick her hands in my underwear, to the point of chasing me into rooms when I would try to run away from her. I would have to block myself in closets and bathroom stalls and scream at the top of my lungs to get her to go away. I feel bad now because I know that she was probably being abused at home, but idk it scared me at the time.

&#x200B;

From the time I was little to until I was about 9, I couldn't go to any sort of family reunion without get sexually harassed/abused. It was mostly by older, distant relatives who I didn't know very well, but there was always something happening to me (though it never really went as far as full-blown rape or even really assault). I would tell my mom, sometimes in tears, and she would just brush it off as them making me (an already squeamish, shy girl) uncomfortable when they would literally be touching me or flashing me or sticking their crotches in my face. It was disgusting. My narc uncle also groomed me and got me to touch him sexually when I was about 9-10.

&#x200B;

On a trip my family took to a campground when I was almost 7, I kept following this group of older boys (about 9-12) around. I thought they were cool and they mostly took me under their wing, until one day three of them and I were looking for frogs in the forest and they assaulted me. The only way I got them to stop was by peeing myself, which got on their hands. It made me feel proud then for defending myself but grossed out and humiliated as I got older.

&#x200B;

When I was 10, I was groomed online by someone whose real age I still don't know (first they said they were 11, then 16, then idk). They would pressure me into sending them sexual things and acting out scenarios with them through text and this online game we met on (not gonna say the actual name cuz it's embarrassing). The scenarios would involve sexual assault and pedophilia and made me uncomfortable but they would just keep asking and saying they would report me until I did. Finally I broke it off and they threatened to doxx me. They sent me my own ip address over and over before I blocked them.

&#x200B;

When I was 11-12, I made friends with this kid in my class. I felt bad for him because nobody else would be his friend, though now I can see that was for a good reason. He had an IEP due to his Conduct Disorder (and was held back two years) so he got a pass out of gym and got the teacher to let me skip gym as well to ""study"" with him. For some reason, we would be unsupervised for long periods at a time (I think because the school thought it would be fine if I was there since I was a good student), and during those times he would repeatedly harass me and threaten me.

He would make me play computer and board games where he would make his character rape my character, he would try to force me to touch him sexually and he would touch me over my underwear/clothes. The kid would also follow me around and try to get me to have sex with him, whispering in my ear and disrespecting my personal space even in front of all my friends. He spread rumours that we were having sex and told me to just get it over with since everybody thought so already. He also said that none of the teachers would believe me if I told them what was going on because he was technically disabled. I'm almost certain now that the kid was some sort of psychopath.

&#x200B;

I'm 15 now. I just want to be okay. This isn't even all of it, there are more instances of me being harassed. I live in a big city so I've been stalked/followed, I've had creepy encounters on the street, I've been groped in passing. I also got a job this past summer and was harassed by my boss at the job.

All of these instances of abuse have really affected the way I see my body (I'm completely afraid of/repulsed by it lol), my ability to form new relationships, and just the way I see the world/other people. I'm also terrified of most men.

"Family was narcissistic, contemptuous, abusive, manipulative, critical and showed no support. We're all older now and they want to be ""friends"" and get credit for being the ""parent."" And I'm not so sure I have the juice to wade into that abyss of depraved need.   I get what Springsteen has said about our job is to honor our parents and not take their struggles and shortcomings further into the generations, but I good deal of that is internal acceptance and decisions about how you conduct yourself, and not necessarily letting the wolf you grew up with back onto the farm, just because you grew up with the wolf.

My therapist supports a respectful and detached distance between me and my family (of origin), which I tend to agree with.  I suppose you can only do what you can, and doing more than that can be harmful, especially after a life of taking on the responsibility of fixing, helping, and taking on the blame for things in other's lives.

"Just want to tell you that if you think you might have trauma, see a therapist or even talk to your regular doctor. People online can't diagnose you or tell you what is trauma and what is not. This is for your own good, you don't want random strangers giving you false reassurance. I hope this post doesn't come across as mean or uncaring. I just see a lot of posts in mental health subs with people wanting reassurance that something either is or isn't trauma. But people online can't tell. Even if they're therapists. They have to see you and give you a clinical interview, have you fill out assessments, etc. Mind is very tricky and can trick you and other people, so that's why the diagnostic process is not easy.

And don't be fooled by some online or TV therapist who as soon as see someone say, Oh I could tell you were traumatized.

No, they can't. They COULD tell something is off or that you are unhappy or nervous, but not why or what happened to you or what your diagnosis is.

So see a doctor and get help if you suspect you have childhood trauma. Or something more recent, like a car accident or medical procedure or other emotionally overwhelming events have unsettled you.

"moving in with fiance w/ PTSD Hi all,

I want to start off by saying the my fiance is actively putting in the effort to go to therapy, see a psychiatrist, go on walks, eat 3 meals, etc. She is a victim of captivity, sexual abuse, and torture by an ex. When we talk torture we're not talking beatings but as being treated as a ""mutt"", eating off the floors, leashes, and a lot of other shitty stuff.

I've known this, have been there through highs and lows and still love her so finally asked her to marry me. Though she said yes, she's also terrified of me living with her and seeing her is her ""worst"" state (she unfortunately doesn't feel safe with others in her living space as her ex invaded her old apt). Until now, I've only interacted with her flashbacks and dissociation over the phone because she let me help but couldn't stand me in her space during those times. I understand.

But now that we're planning on living together she's starting to worry about how it'll go down when I inevitably live in the same space as her. I'm more than happy and honored to be able to help and support her. My own therapist is advising that I don't treat her as a patient but as a loved one. I get it. My fiance doesn't expect me to be there for her as well.

But I want to be prepared for the worst. Google is terrible by just saying talk gently and be there. But what are some of your personal ways of defusing or coming out from episodes?

I'm thinking of things like sensory toys and weighted blankets stationed around the house, ice packs, some bookmarked animal documentaries.

But what are some others? She and I are both open to trying stuff out until something that works comes up.

Tell me what your dream set up would be for a partner and your home. I want to make a space where she is free to go through an episode with no judgement, but abundant resources to overcome the inevitable flashbacks and dissociation happenings.

Thanks in advance!

UPDATE: I'm saying this often but you survivors are my heroes. You've been through things no human should ever experience yet here you are living, breathing,  TEACHING me. You're likely sick of hearing that you're strong but holy smokes you all are so so so so phenomenal. Really hope the present and future holds the best for you. 

UPDATE 2: while I very much appreciate all the compliments and thanks for being there for my fiance, I don't feel comfortable taking credit. 1. All humans should make an effort to learn ways of helping others and 2. I wouldn't have been able to learn and care for folx if all you survivors (including my fiance) didn't speak up, advocated for yourselves, and shared a piece of you with others. You all have the power to educate and point out our shortcomings so please don't give me credit for what you all allowed me to do",ptsd
"Is anyone else getting triggered by the Russo-ukrainian war? I[25M] don't see many posts on here regarding ptsd from war, but I assume there are others. I've spent the past few years trying to live in a normal life. Arguably by suppressing any memory or thought of war. I don't know why but I've been so drawn to footage of this conflict. Something about being reminded.... but everytime I watch something I get a feeling in the pit of my stomach like my organs are bring twisted. And my heart drops and I snap out of reality and get stuck in a rewinding thought or memory. I don't know what to do. I can't look away, but it takes a toll on me seeing all of that stuff. I don't have anyone that I could talk to about it so I end up pushing away those thoughts. But I can feel it building up. I haven't cried in years, but sometimes out of nowhere I feel that I'm going to cry. For just half a second it feels like about to cry. With no trigger or anything.",ptsd

"Instant anger and anxiety when someone taps me I have PTSD from a traumatic and abusive childhood. I don‚Äôt know if the PTSD  and anger at being repetitively touched are related, but I‚Äôm trying to find some answers or at least someone who experiences the same thing. 

When someone taps me repetitively, pats me, or touches me repetitively in any way I am INSTANTLY enraged and intensely anxious. My heart rate spikes, I have to consciously prevent myself from lashing out, and I want to cry. But if someone touches me once with firm pressure, I‚Äôm completely fine. It‚Äôs not that I hate being touched across the board. It‚Äôs just the repetitive touching.

"I cannot stand to be touched Does any of you experience being touched the slightest as a trigger?

I've had these periods of extreme discomfort when people touch me for many years. I've all along tried to adapt to the culture of hugging and other kinds of friendly touch like someone taking my hand or putting their hands on my shoulder.
My husband is the only one who can still touch me without me wanting to scream because my nervous system reacts so violently to this.

How is your experience with this trigger?
How did you overcome.
I'm starting to tell people close to me to keep a distance to my personal space and NOT touch me the slightest. I just need a break from trying to adjust to this culture.

But do I need to, at any time in the future, to accept that people need hugs and so on?

EDIT:
Thanks to all who shared your experience on this. It's of course terrible to read that we struggle with such a basic thing.
Your ways to handle the trigger inspires me, not only to do something about it, but accept along the way that I don't owe anyone hugs etc. It's a big deal to come to this conclusion for me. 
I have read all the comments, and I appreciate every one of them. Thanks for sharing and caring.",ptsd
"PTSD from riots. Feeling so alienated I live in a city where there was significant rioting at the end of May. I was present some nights of protesting and rioting, and live in the neighborhood where riots occurred. the area I live in is also low income, has a lot of homeless people and encampments that the cops keep sweeping. It's been pretty miserable and things are only getting worse. Ever since the riots I've been on edge waiting for there to be more protests around me.

I live near a hospital with a helipad and when the helicopters get too loud I freak out. Last night a shit ton of cop cars were lined up outside my house getting ready to arrest protesters. I could hear them joking around in their cars from my porch. I can see everyone around me on edge. At some point it hit me how fucking hard it is to live this way.

The protesters never made me feel unsafe. Even people rioting and looting didn't worry me that much. It was the fucking nazis running around and the cops tear gassing me and my friends and laughing while they bulldoze tents.

And I have to go about my life like everything is normal. I work as a college TA and I feel so disconnected from everyone. It feels like they've been living in a completely different city from me these last three months. I can't even give a fuck about COVID anymore. I feel like I couldn't even begin to tell most people everything that happened to me this summer. Like they wouldn't even believe me or if they did they'd be horrified.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the kind words and advice. I was hesitant to post because I know that the critics of these protests can be quite loud, but I'm very pleased that there were very few ass holes (one got deleted by a mod before I even saw it, thanks for that). I'm feeling much better than I did when I made this post, I was really shaken by all the cops outside my house and once I was able to be alone with my thoughts I lost it for a bit.

RE: Therapy I definitely have reservations about it for a number of reasons but I'll definitely be looking into some work I can do on my own and possibly EMDR since I've had it recommended before. I've said this to people before but as horrific as things have been I am still SO lucky to have a safe home to live in, stable income, and a very strong support network of close friends. I had a few IRL friends reach out to me because they could tell I was struggling.

I do hope that reading this gave some people who weren't close to any riots some perspective on how damaging the current state of affairs is. I am not the only one who feels this way. I'm white, I've only had to experience this kind of violence very recently, I can't imagine growing up with this level of fear.",ptsd

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for the advice. I never thought my mother might be narcissistic until you mentioned it and it all makes sense. I've decided not to let her sit in with me. She would use the session to manipulate it and try to defend herself. 

EDIT 2: I wanted to offer some more context. My mother has been very controlling all of my life. I recently started to set boundaries with her, which is something I've never done before 
. She thinks it's my wife's influence and says that she is turning her against me. None of this has anything to do with my my wife.",ptsd

"Started a new job and not even 2 weeks in and he found me. This is gonna be a mess I‚Äôm still shaking so sorry for those that read it. His cousin seen me at work yesterday, I run a kitchen in a market downtown. I was so scared to start this new job as we use to hang out in this market all the time, he use to live a few blocks away. I thought he moved. I guess not. Anyways, his cousin was in line for food and I scooted to the back with what I thought was without him seeing me.  I guess not. First thing this morning he‚Äôs here with his cousin. There are two sides to my restaurant, a dessert and lunch side and then my restaurant so luckily we weren‚Äôt open yet but the other side was. He looked me dead in the eyes. I‚Äôm never going to get that image out of my mind. It‚Äôs been 5 years and I still see his face in my nightmares. If I close my eyes right now I can see it clear as day. I could draw it down to every detail. My staff are telling me to not think about. My fianc√© says it‚Äôll be okay. My mom says he can‚Äôt do anything. But they don‚Äôt understand. They don‚Äôt get the sheer panic I felt when I locked eyes with him. The strong instinct to run. And now the pure regret I didn‚Äôt go out there and lay him out flat. The anger is building and I can‚Äôt stop it. I‚Äôm shaking I‚Äôm still so full of adrenaline and this was over an hour ago. I‚Äôm currently hiding in the washroom trying to collect my thoughts before we get smoked over lunch or I‚Äôll be a disaster and I need to lead my team through but right now I don‚Äôt want to be a leader. I want to go home, curl up on my sofa, play LOTR as loud as I can and hold my cats and cry.... then the anger comes back and how badly I wanna hide. Why? Why should I hide? Why am I so fucking scared after 5 years of being free! Then the image of his face. Then the panic. And then it loops.... and keeps looping... I feel powerless against mind.",ptsd

"Having PTSD is like being afraid of ice cream... I‚Äôve been thinking of how to explain what PTSD is for me, and I thought I would share.

Having PTSD is like being afraid of ice cream. You LIKE ice cream. You WANT ice cream. Most of the time, when you think of ice cream, you have positive happy feelings. You look forward to it.

But because of PTSD, sometimes, you irrationally fear ice cream. Sometimes, when someone offers you ice cream, you become SO AFRAID and you don‚Äôt know why. So afraid that you can‚Äôt think. Sometimes ice cream makes you want to throw up. You want run away at the sight of ice cream. You want to CRY because that‚Äôs how scared you are. Your brain goes, what am I doing?! I like ice cream. I‚Äôve been craving ice cream. And yet here I am, running out of the door when I see ice cream. Shoving it back in your face. Getting angry at you, because I‚Äôm convinced this ice cream is poisoned, even without proof, because it was once before. Blacking out if I try to eat it. Going completely numb.

Even when you‚Äôre experiencing it, it doesn‚Äôt make sense. It makes no more sense than fearing ice cream. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs you, then there‚Äôs the ice cream, then there‚Äôs a third version of you which is PTSD, standing in your way. And it is a bummer, because you‚Äôre over here having panic attacks while other people are happily enjoying their ice cream. That is what PTSD is to me - liking ice cream, but also fearing ice cream, and never knowing which way you will feel.",ptsd
"Is anyone else sex repulsed instead of hypersexual from sexual trauma? It seems like everyone I talk to or try to relate to are hypersexual or have a mix of both. It makes me feel alienated from many other people, because I can not relate to having any desire to have sex and any mention or hints at it makes me upset. It feels like I'm even more broken when I can't find anyone who can relate. Many times when someone says they do relate, they say they experience both sex repulsion and hypersexuality, and while that's completely valid I can not relate to them in any way.

You don't have to go into any details or anything, I just wanna feel less alone. I hope everyone's having a good day.

"Pap smears with rape PTSD I am a 17 year old girl. I was sex trafficked by my own grandpa for 8 years of my life. Recently I have been having some problems.

"Brain Study Suggests Traumatic Memories Are Processed as Present Experience It's 3 am for me. I can't sleep due to flashbacks. I'm just reading articles on this God-awful affliction. I like some of the wording and neuroscience insights in this one.

"I just realized I experienced child abuse so much worse than I thought Tw; incest, child abuse, stalking

.
.I'm not sure where to go so I made this reddit account. Thought maybe righting it down and getting out would help? I (enby24) always knew I grew up different but I just realized a lot of my mothers ""lessons in self love"" were abuse. Her teaching me how to/having me help her pick out lingerie and taking pictures of her wearing it wasn't okay at all. Especially not for a child who was under the age of 10 (I don't even remember the exact age it's just something I remember growing up doing) and I always thought that was totally normal. When she abandoned me at 10 it only got worse. My father began hyperfixating on me. When we argued he would say ""were just like an old married couple"" and he would always refer to me as ""his little house wife that would never leave him"" and always buy me really nice gifts and asked for Goodnight kisses and lot of hugs, always wanted me to sit on his lap ect ect. When I was 15 he started calling me sexy and started stalking me (I once caught him outside my friends house and he would sit in the parking lot across from my job and watch me, sit in the school parking lot for hours, tried to put cameras in my bedroom and bathroom) and used to say he wanted to lock me in a tower so I could never leave him and I always felt like he wasn't really joking. he never did/asked for any of those things from my 4 brothers, and in fact told them all many times he wanted to send them to military school/couldn't wait for then to move out. It finally elevated when I was 18 and he told me he was in love with me. Had written me a love note and told me how amazing and incredible I was and how I would be the perfect wife. I ran away and never came back. But now in relationships I realize whenever I start feeling sad/down/like the person I'm with might want to leave me I realize that I get really desperate for sex to the point where if I get turned down I break down for days, convinced I'm unlovable and useless. I'm in therapy for all this but honestly? Some days are just tough and I just realized this weekend that all of that was sexual abuse and that the periods I go through of being hyper sexual are a result of that.

"i think something happened to me as a child, but i cannot remember? Okay so basically, when i was 4 years old i was completely toilet trained and had just stopped bed wetting. my family went on a holiday to south africa where my parents had parties with many random strangers and drugs involved. i know that one night, there was a blackout and my mum told me she can‚Äôt remember what happened because she was on acid and so was my dad. i came back from this trip and began bed wetting and wetting my pants every single day. this went on for years because i simply didn‚Äôt have any ‚Äòsensation‚Äô when i needed to go to the bathroom, it just came when it wanted. this resulted in me being bullied for most of my primary school years making me isolate myself from the rest of the world. at this point, all i could remember from that trip to south africa was these blue bedsheets and how dark it was, but i never questioned that until now. also, growing up i struggled with very sexual intrusive thoughts that i thought were normal at the time, but i have come to learn since that it isn‚Äôt normal for a 6 year old to be having fantasies about being sexually assaulted as how would a child even know what that is? i believe in my heart that something happened to me on that trip, but i feel like i can‚Äôt tell anyone because they won‚Äôt believe me as i can‚Äôt exactly remember. as i‚Äôve gotten older, more memories have surfaced of shadow figures and someone standing over me, but i‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs just my mind playing tricks on me or if what i‚Äôm remembering is real. i‚Äôm writing this to let this out as i‚Äôve held onto this for so long and have nobody in my life who i feel will believe me if i tell them

"20 Fast interventions for panic and dissociation. **Body**

1. **Choose a particular group of muscles and try to maintain awareness of them despite the panic or dissociation. Tense them as tightly as you can and then force them to relax. Stay with the experience of the muscle group trying to relax.** 
2. **Choose a food with a strong flavor like mint, chocolate, cheese, or a pickle. Hold the food on your tongue and stay mindfully aware of the sensation of taste. Notice how different parts of your tongue taste different flavors.**
3. **Find something with a strong texture, like a soft blanket or a cool stone. Feel the item and be mindful of the experience. Try and pull yourself back into the world around you through the connection.** 
4. **Smell a strongly scented item, like peppermint oil or a scented candle. If possible choose a scent that reminds you of a pleasant place or memory. Try and reconnect with your senses and your environment by experiencing the strong smell. Notice what the smell makes you think about or feel in your body.**
5. **Laying under an ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù blanket or weighted blanket can be a stimulating somatic experience. If you don't have one, try lying under several heavy blankets to slow your heart rate and calm down.** 
6. **Rub a mentholated lotion around the neck and chest when you notice panic starting. There are many brands like Blue Stop ‚Ñ¢ that are marketed for arthritis and muscle pain. The cooling sensation can help you reconnect with your body and slow your heart rate.** 
7. **Wrap a frozen bag of peas in a towel and put it across your forehead and eyes. This will activate the body‚Äôs natural ‚Äúdive response‚Äù.  When the head becomes colder than the rest of the body, your body thinks it is diving into deep water and will slow your heart rate and relax muscles to save oxygen.**

# Mind

1. **Make a mantra about the fear, negative belief, or trigger for your panic or dissociation. This should be something that reminds you that you are ok and that the belief about the trauma is not true right now. Eg. ‚ÄúI am safe, I am free‚Äù or ‚Äúmy past is not my future‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am loving, I am loved‚Äù. Repeat the mantra to yourself when you notice the distressing belief taking hold.** 
2. **Break down what you are currently doing into a series of steps, and repeat back to yourself the steps of what you are doing in a deconstructed way. Remember that you are competent and that these are easy things to do. Eg. ‚ÄúI am turning on my blinker at the intersection‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am putting peanut butter on the bread‚Äù.**
3. **Go through your phone or a mental calendar of future events and realize that this moment is just one part of the rest of your life. Go through your schedule and realize that right now is just one minute of the next hour of the next day of the next week of the next year. Think about things that you are excited to do in the future. Think of ways you can prepare for them.** 
4. **Try and put your finger on the exact emotions that you are feeling. ‚ÄúOverwhelmed‚Äù or ‚Äúfreaked out‚Äù are not emotions. Try and specifically describe your experience. Ask yourself if your current reality necessitates this experience. Try and discover if you are feeling scared, vulnerable or angry in this moment. If so, try and figure out who or what you are directing these emotions toward.**  
5. **The ‚Äústuck memory‚Äù of the trauma remembers the muscle groups that were tightened during the trauma. It remembers the way that you wanted to move your body's posture to protect yourself. Most importantly it remembers the way that you felt about yourself during the trauma. you may have wanted to curl up into a ball or stand up and fight. You may have thought that you were dirty, weak, small, or foolish. remind yourself that the traumatic belief you had about yourself during the trauma is not true. Also, try and move your posture into the opposite position the trauma belief makes it want to move into. Relax all muscle groups that want to tighten.**

# Soul 

1. **Think of an object or a place that you find beautiful. Look up a picture on your phone if you have access to one. Think about what you find beautiful about this object or place. Notice all of the things that you appreciate about the beauty of this place or object. Eg. pictures of the beach or a famous painting or sculpture** 
2. **Think about someone you love and feel safe with.  Think about what it is that you love about them. Think about this person and try and cultivate compassion for them. Feel yourself move from isolation to connection, and fear to compassion. If a word or phrase jumps out at you that represents this relationship to you, then repeat it to yourself in your head. Eg. Trust, kindness, safety**
3. **Think of your whole life like a giant web. Imagine yourself at the center and the strands of the web as your connections to others. Think of all the people that you love. Imagine where they are right now and when you will see them again. Imagine that the strings of the web run out from you to where your loved ones are in the world..** 
4. **Creativity requires us to get outside our own immediate experiences and reconnect with our resilient self. Draw a picture with anything you have, pen and napkin or toe in the dirt. Think about how you want to feel and try and express that feeling however you can. Hum a tune or sing a song if that is more appealing to you. When you feel that you are out of the immediate experience of the panic or dissociation, do a more complex creative activity that you find healing. Bake a cake, paint pictures, write a short poem, or make yourself do a small home improvement project. Reconnecting with our creative image and spatial processing part of the brain allows us to draw new connections and create new learned experience that helps us process trauma.** 
5. **Go to a space that you find calming, spiritual, or that feeds you in a personal way. Walk in the woods, sit by a lake, bird watch, attend a religious service, watch a theater piece, or go for a scenic drive. Find a space where you feel like you are calm, safe, and can start to be yourself again.**  
6. **Try to find your center or mindful self during the experience of the panic or dissociation. Think about the essence, psyche, or soul of yourself as a person. Feel how this anxiety, panic and dissociative episode is holding you back from being present like you would like to be. Ask yourself, what in me do I need to leave behind so the rest of me can become what I want to be? Ask yourself, what enlarges what I am, and what restricts who I am? Visualize yourself taking off or moving away from the anxiety experience. Realize that it is hurting you and not helping you right now. Try and feel yourself leave some of it behind so your mindful self can become more present.**

"Anyone else get triggered and feel unsafe around unorganized/spontaneous people? Anyone else get triggered and feel unsafe around unorganized/spontaneous people?

I am actually technically an ENFP so at my core, I can be pretty spontaneous, unpredictable, and disorganized myself. However, my manager part (Internal Family Systems Part) is very organized, impatient, efficient, logical and perfectionistic. My manager comes out frequently when I need to protect myself and take control of myself and surroundings. At this time in my life, I notice I feel triggered and unsafe around people and especially those who are supposed to take care of me when they are disorganized and unpredictable. I need to know they have my back and can catch me if I fall. I crave calm, logical, organized, and predictable people. I cannot stand when I am around people who are indecisive and make decisions in a flash based on their feelings. I notice I feel a lot of anxiety in relationships with people like this as it triggers my insecure attachment. 

I have learned that people with a traumatic background often benefit from structure and stability to assist in regulating emotions. Recently, I have had some bad experiences with my surgeon and therapist that makes me distrust their expertise. They both are laid back, unorganized and forgetful. When I notice these traits, my manager comes out and takes the role of being the organized person. I feel stressed and hypervigilant doing this as it is not even who I truly am at my best as an ENFP. I feel annoyed and impatient around them as they appear lazy and passive. I feel like I do not trust them to take care of me due to their qualities such as not calling me when they said they would. I know this is definitely related to my trauma background where my abusers were often unpredictable and you never knew what their next move would be so you had to be on edge and hypervigilant. I wonder if I should switch therapists because when I take on the manager role, it gets in the way of me doing EMDR because my exile has a hard time coming out when my manager is so present. 

I know no one is perfect and they have traits that very logical people lack such as gentleness and warmth. But I really think I thrive when people can balance me out and I feel safer when my doctors are more logical and organized. I also know once I heal more from my trauma,  I will be able to feel less triggered and unsafe around people with these qualities. 

 I really struggle with working with people like this! Does anyone else relate?",ptsd
"Good guy Food Lion I was just in Food Lion and they had a big sign near their fireworks. The sign stated ""Please be a good neighbor and be mindful that unannounced ignition near military veterans and some people and some pets may be traumatic""

As someone who personally abhors fireworks and becomes a complete mess on July 4th I really appreciated this sign! It spoke of multiple groups and brought some attention to PTSD that a normal person may not consider.

"To the guy on here that posted that anyone with non combat related ptsd are pansies and should stfu, you are wrong and here is why (This is super long)

You know, I've never fully revealed on here why I have PTSD. I've just given the gist. But let me tell you my story, and why don't you tell me if I can ""Just get over it"" and ""my ptsd is not real ptsd""

My story starts with my high school sweetheart. Together since 16 and we married as soon as I turned 18. But when we got married, things started to change. Little things. He would become jealous when he wasn't previously a jealous person. He started to be controlling. Then he started to get angry. Then one day, I don't remember the reason, but it was when the physical violence started. He choked me until I passed out. I thought maybe this was a one time thing. But no. Stupid scared and naive 18yo me wanted to make a marriage work. His jealously became worse and he stared to hit me when we argued, over the most trivial things I might add (like who ate the last doughnut), he would hit me for that too. He'd grab my arm so hard there'd be bruises where his fingers were pressing. He constantly tried to convince me that we should kill ourselves together. 

Then, 3 months into our marriage, I had the worst experience of my life. He had gotten mad at me for spending too long over at a friends house and accused me of seeing another guy there. So he put me in ""the hole"". In our house, there was a loose board in the stairs that you could pry open, revealing the ground underneath the stairs. He put me in the hole and the other stair boards were nailed in, I was too short to reach the lose one. He left me in there for 3 days with no light. He would only open the board to throw water and granola bars at me, and occasionally try to urinate on me. I sat in that hole in the corner for 3 days and nights. I screamed but no one could hear. Finally, he pulls up the board and pulls me out. He tells me to get cleaned up and hurry, I have 10 minutes. It turns out, my parents had just called him and said they were coming to stay the weekend with us. I was too scared to tell them and I am ashamed of that. 

The night they left, I asked him if he would get off of the computer so I could use the phone to call my (gay) best friend (we had dialup). He then became angry. He flipped the computer table and it fell to the ground. He accused me of cheating on him with my gay friend, that he wasnt really gay and that we had been having an affair and playing him for a fool all along.

I had never seen him this angry, so I ran to the bathroom and locked myself in. Thankfully my cell phone was in there and I called my gay friend (who lived a block away) And i told him that it was bad and was scared and to get a friend (Brad) to come over and help me. Well husband broke down the bathroom door (he was 6'5 250lbs) and pulled me out to the living room. He told me to sit on the couch while he went to get something. I ran to my room but he caught me before I got there. He dragged me on the floor by my hair back to the living room. He had gotten a shotgun and he pointed it at me and he told me that he was going to kill me and then kill himself. At this moment, (I found out later that my gay friend and Brad had peeked through the window and saw husband with the gun) Brad opens the door really fast. Husband happened to be standing close enough to it that it hit him in the back and it knocked him over. Brad took me by the hand and we left. I have never seen my husband again.

So there is my story of why I have PTSD.  I want you to tell me now if my PTSD isn't ""real"" PTSD because I wasn't in combat.

To the guy who posted, you are a fool. Combat veterans arent the only people in the world that have PTSD. And for you to make a post suggesting that anyone with ""childhood trauma"" doesn't really have PTSD and should just deal with their problems like adults, you make me sick. ",ptsd
"I was told that my PTSD is too severe and I need a specialist  I finally worked up the courage (and money) to go see a doctor and find out if I could get prescribed something. ANYTHING. She said she was sorry but couldn‚Äôt lie to me, my issues are far outside her range of expertise. I had just gone over with the nurse what I was dealing with and wiped my tears before the doctor came. I then burst into tears out of frustration when she gave me her answer. I paid $171 out of pocket just to see her. I asked her ‚ÄúDid I just spend close to $200 just to be told you can‚Äôt help me?‚Äù. I think she was going to pocket my money but I walked out and I asked for a refund. I feel soooo defeated. I‚Äôve been struggling for years and I cannot afford a specialist. All of the psychiatrists (well 4 psychs, 3 therapists and 1 specialist) I‚Äôve seen since I was 22 did not take insurance. They said the insurance companies caused so many problems that they just stopped accepting it. Something has got to give. I‚Äôm 31 and my trauma has only been compounded by a recent violently abusive relationship. I have no one to help me or even a shoulder to cry on. This is exhausting. I did make a call to a ketamine clinic and so I‚Äôm hoping I can maybe get some help there because as long as my insurance is accepted my sessions will be way cheaper than I expected. But out of pocket is over a $1000. Idk I just needed to vent and cry a little. The American health care system is more than a joke, it‚Äôs a scam. ",ptsd
"Should I tell my wife‚Äôs brother‚Äôs wife the truth about his abuse? I‚Äôve known for over 15 years about the molesting and rape of my wife by her brother when they were kids.

Everyone thought it‚Äôs just her anger issues and she‚Äôs crazy but the last several months the childhood memories have been tormenting her. Her mother came in our room and proceeded to call her a phycopath bitch and I lost it on her as she knew it happened and did nothing because their father had said I caught him on her and spanked him (him-13, her-11).

"I have diagnosed PTSD, but the triggering event ended with everyone being safe, and it makes me feel guilty and stupid, but I am nearly not able to function. Hi all - To keep it short, I had to save my young son (7) from a rogue wave set that tore him off the beach in Hawaii a couple years ago. It took \*every. single. bit\* of everything I had to do it. At one point I made my peace and was on my way to accepting that I wasn't gonna make it, but I would be damned if he wasn't.   


We both made it out. I don't really know how, but we did, and neither of us needed medical treatment, but I wasn't ok. Immediately I knew I wasn't ok.   


I have been on meds (the nightmares, oh my god the nightmares), I have done EMDR, and both have helped, but it always feels like it wears off.   


I don't want to leave my house. Hell, I don't want to leave my room. I am constantly just waiting for the next bad thing.   


I feel like my friends and family, who have been very supportive, esp my loving wife, are growing tired of me. But I can't explain it, I don't want to do anything. I seem to be slipping into lower and lower power states, where normal things seem too hard to deal with, and I put off things until they are either about to go wrong, or right after. I can't seem to do anything that would ""save"" me from additional issues, money, time, whatever - and the worst part is I KNOW I need to do them and its like I handcuffed.   


Then on top of it all, I feel like a fraud. Like a charlatan. There are so many persons that are fully entitled to their PTSD due to the horrific things that have happened to them. I feel so stupid for mine, like its stolen valor.

"Boyfriend made me torture animals Working with a therapist on this one but it's really hard for me to process. Doing EMDR / ART.

Eventually he starved me for a week inside his cabin.

"I'm not a veteran but I was wondering if it's okay I post here? Im not a veteren, I devolped my PTSD at 13 & was diagnosed at 15. If I'm not suppose to be posting here I'm really sorry. I don't want to be insensitive or intrude on a space for such a serious disorder as I'm sure many here have survived much worse things and I sometimes feel selfish(?), or maybe wrong(?) to say I'm struggling with my PTSD or ask for help like many of you all because of some survivor guilt & fear of fire.

I turned 26 this year. Really no big deal at all other then I feel like I wasted the last few years. As im sure many of you can relate to having, I'm having a particularly tough day. Just a lot of thinking, a bit too much honestly. Mostly about how I'm not happy with who I've become. What I've done. The choices I've made, & am I really allowed to be upset about the consequences of my own actions? When it hit me.

By the end of this year I will have lived more years **with** PTSD then without. That thought killed me. I've always had trouble with remembering a lot of what happened before the fire. The good & the bad. Better or worse. I know these are repressed memories & not forgotten. That they can be gotten back. 

Yet I'm starting to feel like I've forgotten who I was before I had PTSD. I can feel these beautiful moments & old version myself slipping away, & it feels as if I'm holding on to them by barbed wire. I do everything I can to pull them close enough only to find they're to shredded to make out. & It feels as if I did more damage to myself then good. But I'm so scared to let them go.

I don't expect anyone to have any answers. To be honest I'm not really sure who or why I'm writing all this. Again I'm really sorry if this is the wrong sub.

"How do you explain to somebody that loud noises are a PTSD trigger without explicitly telling them you have PTSD? Basically the title.

I'm currently an intern at a metal processing company. Due to the nature of my position I'm in close proximity to the tension testing machine. I've tried tension testing the last time I interned here and kinda, sorta made it work but the distress it caused me bubbled over into my private life.

Last week I was supposed to do it again, but had to fight to keep down a panic attack and asked my coworker if he could complete it. I just got asked why I can't do it this time and just gave some vague answer. I feel really bad for not being able to do it and I kinda do want to give an explanation but this feels way too personal to discuss it with someone I'll never see again in a couple of days.

EDIT: thank you for all the comments trying to help, but the issue is that I did the testing (what looked like to them) ""just fine"" in April but said I can't do it now. I need to get it across to them without disclosing that I have PTSD because I don't want to deal with the ""aww poor baby"" reactions this time.",ptsd

"being gaslighted by my therapist? tw- mentioning sa, nothing graphic or specific 

recently, i‚Äôve really felt like i‚Äôm being gaslighted by my therapist.

we‚Äôve been doing trauma therapy for a few years now and i‚Äôve recently decided i‚Äôd like to take a break and focus on my current life. since then, i‚Äôve really felt like he‚Äôs gaslighting me.

first, he keeps bringing up my trauma and asking if it ‚Äúreally happened‚Äù i never know what to say when he asks. sure, healthy skepticism is valid, but he‚Äôs my therapist i‚Äôve been working with for years and it feels like a betrayal of trust. 

i told his yesterday ‚Äúi feel like you don‚Äôt believe me‚Äù and his response was ‚Äúno. i believe you more than you believe yourself‚Äù which felt like he was lying. if he wasn‚Äôt then why has he repeated asked me if i was faking? 

he‚Äôs frankly asked some really out there questions too. he think i should get a hymen check to prove what really happened happened. that made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable because a) i‚Äôm not even pursing legal action against my abusers at the moment b) hymen checks aren‚Äôt a good indication of sexual abuse and c) he should believe me unless i say otherwise. i even told him that was out of line and he said it was ‚Äújust a thought‚Äù

when he makes me uncomfortable or pushes me to speak about something when i don‚Äôt want to i tell him ‚Äúi‚Äôm not ready to talk about this yet‚Äù and he told me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going back to day one in therapy‚Äù

which is really, really ironic because day 1 me had no sense of boundaries and always let him drive the conversation. i‚Äôve finally built the confidence to advocate my needs and he treats me like that‚Äôs a bad thing. it makes me feel like i should just listen to him because he knows best and maybe i‚Äôm wrong for speaking up. 

sorry this was so long. i just wanted advice from others if this is normal behavior for a therapist or if i‚Äôm being gaslighted. i don‚Äôt use the word gaslight lightly but he‚Äôs making me doubt my own reality and perception of what happened to me. 

does anyone have any thoughts or advice? it would be appreciated",ptsd
"Is doubting own trauma common? TW: Abuse I need advice from objective people (tldr at bottom). 

Years ago I (M) said no to someone (F) who wanted to have sex with me. She asked and I said I wasn't comfortable with that. She asked again and I said I didn't want to. We were sitting down at the time. She got on top of me and I froze as she had sex with me. I didn't push her off. She tried to kiss me and I tried to turn away but was unable to. The whole thing was very brief. I didnt think too much about it for years after (i had the mindset of 'I am male so it isn't the same' ) and I have been on good terms with her since. 

I went for therapy a couple years ago and was diagnosed with PTSD. My therapist at the time focused a lot on why she acted she did at the time and in the years I've known this person I've learned she was sexually assaulted by guys before I knew her. Likewise I was sexually assaulted by an older boy when i was very young. I gradually began to understand why she acted the way she did and also why I froze (i was beaten up a lot as a kid too and i would always freeze then as well). To that end I hold no anger towards her, as she was a product of her suffering. It helped me move on for a time. She's changed. I've changed. We've grown and now we are supportive of each other. I have forgiven my other attackers as well as part of my own journey. 

The problem I have is that sometimes I doubt the whole thing and now I blame myself. Its like 'i hold no anger, i understand why she was like that' but now I question whether I was raped at all. 

**Tl:DR: **  I guess I'm just looking for a more objective outsider opinion: Given that I said I didnt want sex twice and then didnt fight back, I was still raped, right? Being on good terms now and understanding why that happened doesnt invalidate my experience does it? Is my self doubt just a part of the PTSD?

Advice appreciated.",ptsd

I was never an angry person and I'm dealing with the fact my head compartmentalized things in such a way that when I observe myself now as a whole, I feel like I should recognize better when I feel angry and I'm doing things defensively. I tend to be oblivious of my faults at those times.
But on the other hand, if I focus on my faults I have a hard time speaking for myself because my head is 100% focused on ""I fucked up"", I can't place what the other person's done in perspective. I give up too much on myself. 

How do you guys reconcile this? I'm aware it's because I'm very co-dependent.

I always thought that he  didn‚Äôt realize how badly he was harming me, even though there was blood, even though I was saying, stop, you are hurting me. Even though he was lifting my body up off the couch with every blow of his fist. 

Two days ago I was triggered and had to ride out some horrendous flashbacks.  And for the first time, as I felt myself back in the bathroom where I had gotten away from him, where I was trying to stop the slow of blood, I felt anger toward him. I realized: this man knew EXACTLY what he was doing. He knew he was being violent, he knew he was harming me. And I was probably not the only woman he raped so viciously. For the first time I wanted to kick down that bathroom door and come back at him... I wanted to kick him and pummel him and claw his face and scream until he heard me. I wanted to beat him bloody. For the first time I did not excuse him.
